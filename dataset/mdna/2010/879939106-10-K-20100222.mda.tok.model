we perform a variety of bpo services for our clients and support more than unique bpo programs

we believe the benefits of bpo include renewed focus on core capabilities  faster time to market  enhanced revenue generation opportunities  streamlined processes  reduced capital and operating risk  movement from a fixed to variable cost structure  access to borderless sourcing capabilities  and creation of proprietary best operating practices and technology  all of which contribute to increased customer satisfaction and shareholder returns for our clients 
industry studies indicate that companies with high customer satisfaction levels enjoy premium pricing in their industry  which we believe results in increased profitability and greater shareholder returns 
given the strong correlation between customer satisfaction and improved profitability  we believe that more companies are increasingly focused on selecting outsourcing partners  such as teletech  that can deliver strategic revenue generation and front to back office capabilities to improve the customer experience rather than reducing costs 
our business history we were founded in and reorganized as a delaware corporation in we completed an initial public offering of our common stock in and since that time have grown our annual revenue from million to billion  representing a compound annual growth rate cagr of

table of contents delivery centers around the globe 
many of our clients choose a blended strategy whereby they outsource work with us in multiple geographic locations and may also utilize our work from home offering 
we believe our ability to offer one of the most geographically diverse footprints improves service flexibility while reducing operational and delivery risk in the event of a service interruption at any one location 
with operations in countries  we believe this makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse providers of bpo services 
we plan to selectively expand into other attractive delivery markets over time 
of the countries from which we provide bpo services  nine provide services for onshore clients including the us  australia  brazil  china  germany  new zealand  northern ireland  scotland and spain 
the other seven countries provide services  partially or entirely  for offshore clients including argentina  canada  costa rica  malaysia  mexico  the philippines and south africa 
the total number of workstations in these countries is  or of our total delivery capacity 
historical performance as summarized below  following our initial public offering in  we experienced double digit revenue growth through  undertook a business transformation strategy in late  began to realize the benefits of this transformation in and continue to realize those benefits 
beginning in  we were one of the first companies to provide bpo services to us clients from delivery centers in argentina  canada and mexico 
although revenue growth continued at a cagr of from million in to billion in  we experienced net losses during this time period 
we attribute these losses primarily to the global economic downturn  the bursting of the dot com bubble  the september  terrorist attacks and the business transformation we undertook to further strengthen our industry position and future competitiveness 
the business transformation redefined our delivery model  reduced our cost structure and improved our competitive and financial position by migrating from a decentralized holding company to a centralized operating company to enhance financial and operating disciplines  centralizing our technology infrastructure and migrating to a ip based delivery platform  standardizing our global operational processes and applications  automating and virtualizing our human capital needs primarily around talent acquisition  training and performance optimization  improving the efficiency of certain underperforming operations and reducing our selling  general and administrative expenses  improving pricing or rationalizing the performance of certain underperforming client programs  investing in sales and client account management  investing in innovative new solutions to diversify revenue into higher margin offerings  including professional services  learning services and hosted technology solutions  increasing delivery capabilities with expanded onshore  offshore and work from home solutions  reducing long term debt by nearly million from to with cash surpluses and borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and approving and executing a stock repurchase program 
as a result of this business transformation  from to  our revenue grew at a cagr of from billion to billion and diluted earnings per share grew at a cagr of from to 
our operating margin more than doubled to in from in 
table of contents due to the global economic slowdown  our revenue decreased from to by  which included a decrease of due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
despite this decrease  we were able to increase our operating margin for to 
this was achieved through increased professional services revenue  increased utilization of our delivery centers across a hour period  leveraging our global purchasing power and continued expansion of services provided from our geographically diverse delivery centers 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and a debt to capitalization ratio of 
we generated million in free cash flow during and our cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility have enabled us to fund million in capital expenditures 
approximately of our capital expenditures were related to the opening and or growth of our delivery platform with the remaining used for maintenance of our embedded infrastructure and internal technology projects 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of free cash flow and other non gaap measurements 
in november  the board of directors board authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to million of our common stock with the objective of increasing stockholder returns 
the board has since periodically authorized additional increases in the program 
since inception of the program through december   the board has authorized the repurchase of shares up to an aggregate value of million 
during the year ended december   we purchased million shares for million 
since inception of the program  we have purchased million shares for million 
as of december   the remaining allowance under the program was approximately million 
for the period from january  thru february   we have purchased an additional million shares for million 
on february   the board authorized an increase of million in the funding available for share repurchase 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
our future growth goals and strategy our objective is to become the world s largest  most technologically advanced and innovative provider of onshore  offshore and work from home bpo solutions 
companies within the global are our primary client targets due to their size  global nature  focus on outsourcing and desire for the global  scalable integrated process solutions that we offer 
we have developed  and continue to invest in  a broad set of capabilities designed to serve this growing client need 
these investments include our teletech home offering which allows our employees to serve clients from their homes 
this capability has enhanced the flexibility of our offering by allowing clients to choose our onshore  offshore or work from home employees to meet their outsourced business process needs 
in addition  we have begun to offer hosted services where clients can license any aspect of our global network and proprietary applications 
while the revenue from these offerings is small relative to our consolidated revenue  we believe it will continue to grow as these services become more widely adopted by our clients 
we aim to further improve our competitive position by investing in a growing suite of new and innovative business process services across our targeted industries 
our business strategy to increase revenue  profitability and our industry position includes the following elements capitalize on the favorable trends in the global outsourcing environment  which we believe will include more companies that want to adopt or increase bpo services  consolidate outsourcing providers with those that have a solid financial position  adequate capital resources to sustain a long term relationship and globally diverse delivery capabilities across a broad range of solutions  
table of contents modify their approach to outsourcing based on total value delivered versus the lowest priced provider  create focused revenue generation capabilities in targeted market segments  better integrate front and back office processes  and take advantage of cost efficiencies through the adoption of cloud based technology solutions 
deepen and broaden our relationships with existing clients  win business with new clients and focus on end to end offerings in targeted industries where we expect accelerating adoption of business process outsourcing  continue to invest in innovative proprietary technology and new business offerings  continue to diversify revenue into higher margin offerings such as professional services  talent acquisition  learning services and our hosted teletech ondemand tm capabilities  continue to improve our operating margins through selected profit improvement initiatives and increased asset utilization of our globally diverse delivery centers  scale our work from home initiative to increase operational flexibility  and selectively pursue acquisitions that extend our capabilities  geographic reach and or industry expertise 
our market opportunity companies around the world are increasingly realizing that the quality of their customer relationships is critical to maintaining their competitive advantage 
this realization has driven companies to increase their focus on developing  managing  growing and continuously enhancing their customer relationships 
as globalization of the world s economy continues to accelerate  businesses are increasingly competing on a large scale basis due to rapid advances in technology and communications that permit cost effective real time global communications and ready access to a highly skilled worldwide labor force 
as a result of these developments  companies have increasingly outsourced business processes to third party providers in an effort to enhance or maintain their competitive position and reduce risk while increasing shareholder value through improved productivity and profitability 
revenue in decreased over the prior year due primarily to the global economic slowdown resulting in a decline in our current call volumes  delayed client purchasing decisions along with the continued migration of several of our clients to our offshore delivery centers  and proactively managing underperforming business and geographies out of our portfolio 
nevertheless  we believe that our revenue will resume long term growth as global demand for our services is fueled by the following trends focus on providers who can offer fully integrated revenue generation solutions 
a focus on providers who can offer fully integrated revenue generation solutions to target new markets and improve revenue and profitability through customer acquisition  retention and growth by leveraging the profitability potential of each customer 
integration of front and back office business processes to provide increased operating efficiencies and an enhanced customer experience especially in light of the weakening global economic environment 
companies have realized that integrated business processes reduce operating costs and allow customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently resulting in higher customer satisfaction and brand loyalty thereby improving their competitive position 
a majority of our historic revenue has been derived from providing customer facing front office solutions to our clients 
given that our global delivery centers are also fully capable of providing back office solutions  we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue by winning more back office opportunities and providing the services during non peak hours with minimal incremental 
table of contents investment 
furthermore  by spreading our fixed costs across a larger revenue base and increasing our asset utilization  we expect our profitability to improve over time 
increasing percentage of company operations being outsourced to most capable third party providers 
having experienced success with outsourcing a portion of their business processes  companies are increasingly inclined to outsource a larger percentage of this work 
we believe companies will continue to consolidate their business processes with third party providers  such as teletech  who are financially stable and able to invest in their business while also demonstrating an extensive global operating history and an ability to cost effectively scale to meet their evolving needs 
increasing adoption of outsourcing across broader groups of industries 
early adopters of the business process outsourcing trend  such as the media and communications industries  are being joined by companies in other industries  including healthcare  retail and financial services 
these companies are beginning to adopt outsourcing to improve their business processes and competitiveness 
for example  we see increasing interest in our services from companies in the healthcare  retail and financial services industries 
we believe the number of other industries that will adopt or increase their level of outsourcing will continue to grow  further enabling us to increase and diversify our revenue and client base 
focus on speed to market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations 
as companies broaden their product offerings and seek to enter new emerging markets  they are looking for outsourcing providers that can provide speed to market while reducing their capital and operating risk 
to achieve these benefits  companies are seeking bpo providers with an extensive operating history  an established global footprint  the financial strength to invest in innovation to deliver more strategic capabilities and the ability to scale and meet customer demands quickly 
given our financial stability  geographic presence in countries and our significant investment in standardized technology and processes  we believe that clients select teletech because we can quickly ramp large  complex business processes around the globe in a short period of time while assuring a high quality experience for their customers

certain of our communications clients  which represent approximately of our total annual revenue  also provide us with telecommunication services through transactions that are negotiated at different times and with different legal entities

risk factors in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section  in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks that we face 
if any of these risks or uncertainties 
table of contents actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline 
risks relating to our business recent changes in us and global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our business our business is directly affected by the performance of our clients and general economic conditions 
recent turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the us and other regions of the world in which we do business 
there is evidence that this is affecting demand for some of our services 
in substantially all of our client programs  we generate revenue based  in large part  on the amount of time our employees devote to our clients customers 
consequently  the amount of revenue generated from any particular client program is dependent upon consumers interest in and use of our client s products and or services  which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
our clients may not be able to market or develop products and services that require their customers to use our services  especially as a result of the recent downturn in the us and worldwide economy 
furthermore  a decline in our clients business or performance  including possible client bankruptcies  could impair their ability to pay for our services 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if any of our major clients were unable or unwilling  for any reason  to pay for our services 
a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of our clients could cause a reduction in our revenue and operating results we rely on strategic  long term relationships with large  global companies in targeted industries 
as a result  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients 
our five largest clients collectively represented of revenue in and of revenue in our ten largest clients represented of revenue in and of revenue in one of our clients  t mobile  represented of our revenue in another one of our clients  sprint nextel  represented of our revenue in we believe that a substantial portion of our total revenue will continue to be derived from a relatively small number of our clients in the future 
the contracts with our five largest clients expire between and we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that any contracts will be renewed or  if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
the volumes and profit margins of our most significant programs may decline and we may not be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate comparable revenue and profits 
the loss of all or part of a major client s business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
client consolidations could result in a loss of clients or contract concessions that would adversely affect our operating results we serve clients in targeted industries that have historically experienced a significant level of consolidation 
if one of our clients is acquired by another company including another one of our clients  provisions in certain of our contracts allow these clients to cancel or renegotiate their contracts  or to seek contract concessions 
such consolidations may result in the termination or phasing out of an existing client contract  volume discounts and other contract concessions that could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation  penalties and cause us to lose clients we are dependent on it networks and systems to process  transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients 
security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
we are also required at times to manage  utilize 
table of contents and store sensitive or confidential client or customer data 
as a result  we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect this information  such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information 
if any person  including any of our employees  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data  we could be subject to monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer data  whether through systems failure  employee negligence  fraud or misappropriation  could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
similarly  unauthorized access to or through our information systems or those we develop for our clients  whether by our employees or third parties  could result in negative publicity  legal liability and damage to our reputation  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our financial results depend on our capacity utilization  in particular our ability to forecast our clients customer demand and make corresponding decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and operating expenses our delivery center utilization rates have a substantial and direct effect on our profitability  and we may not achieve desired utilization rates 
our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to maintain and increase capacity in each of our delivery centers during peak and non peak hours  our ability to predict our clients customer demand for our services and thereby to make corresponding decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and other operating expenditures in each of our delivery center locations  our ability to hire and assimilate new employees and manage employee turnover  and our need to devote time and resources to training  professional development and other non chargeable activities 
however  because the majority of our business is inbound from our clients customer initiated encounters  we have significantly higher utilization during peak weekday periods than during off peak night and weekend periods 
we have experienced periods of idle capacity  particularly in our multi client delivery centers 
historically  we experience idle peak period capacity upon opening a new delivery center or termination or completion of a large client program 
we may consolidate or close under performing delivery centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in the event we close delivery centers in the future  we may be required to record restructuring or impairment charges  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain desired delivery center capacity utilization 
as a result of the fixed costs associated with each delivery center  quarterly variations in client volumes  many of which are outside our control  can have a material adverse effect on our utilization rates 
if our utilization rates are below expectations in any given quarter  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for that quarter could be adversely affected 
our business depends on uninterrupted service to clients our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our facilities  computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  terrorist or cyber attacks  sabotage  telecommunications interruption or failure  labor shortages  weather conditions  natural disasters and other similar events 
additionally  severe weather can cause our employees to miss work and interrupt the delivery of our services  resulting in a loss of revenue 
in the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our locations including our corporate headquarters building  our business could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to pay contractual damages or face the suspension or loss of a client s business 
further  the impacts associated with global climate change  such as rising sea levels or increased and intensified storm activity  may cause increased business interruptions or may require the relocation of our facilities 
table of contents located in low lying coastal areas 
although we maintain property and business interruption insurance  such insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur 
many of our contracts utilize performance pricing that link some of our fees to the attainment of various performance or business targets  which could increase the variability of our revenue and operating margin a majority of our contracts include performance clauses that condition some of our fees on the achievement of agreed upon performance standards or milestones 
these performance standards can be complex and often depend in some measure on our clients actual levels of business activity or other factors outside of our control 
if we fail to satisfy these measures  it could reduce our revenue under the contracts or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms 
our contracts provide for early termination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results most of our contracts do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue and the profitability of each client program may fluctuate  sometimes significantly  throughout the various stages of a program 
our contracts generally enable the clients to terminate the contract or reduce customer interaction volumes 
our larger contracts generally require the client to pay a contractually agreed amount and or provide prior notice in the event of early termination 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to collect early termination fees 
we may not be able to offset increased costs with increased service fees under long term contracts some of our larger long term contracts allow us to increase our service fees if and to the extent certain cost or price indices increase 
the majority of our expenses are payroll and payroll related  which includes healthcare costs 
over the past several years  payroll costs  including healthcare costs  have increased at a rate much greater than that of general cost or price indices 
increases in our service fees that are based upon increases in cost or price indices may not fully compensate us for increases in labor and other costs incurred in providing services 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover increases in our costs through increased service fees 
our business may be affected by our ability to obtain financing from time to time  we may need to obtain debt or equity financing for capital expenditures  stock repurchases  payment of existing obligations  replenishment of cash reserves  acquisitions or joint ventures 
additionally  our existing credit facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing  or that any such financing would be on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the financial covenants under our debt agreements or  in the event of noncompliance  will be able to obtain waivers or amendments from the lenders 
our business may be affected by risks associated with international operations and expansion an important component of our growth strategy is continued international expansion 
there are certain risks inherent with conducting international business  including but not limited to management of personnel overseas  longer payment cycles  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  foreign currency exchange rates  difficulties in complying with foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  
table of contents political and social instability  as demonstrated by terrorist threats  regime change  increasing tension in the middle east and other regions  and the resulting need for enhanced security measures  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one or more of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our international operations successfully 
our financial results may be impacted by foreign currency exchange risk we serve an increasing number of our clients from delivery centers in other countries that include argentina  canada  costa rica  malaysia  mexico  the philippines and south africa 
contracts with these clients are typically priced  invoiced  and paid in us dollars while the costs incurred to operate these delivery centers are denominated in the functional currency of the applicable non us based operating subsidiary 
therefore  fluctuations between the currencies of the contracting and operating subsidiary present foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and approximately of our revenue is derived from contracts denominated in other currencies  our results of operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
while we enter into forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  the foreign exchange exposure between the contracting and operating subsidiaries is not hedged 
since the operating subsidiary assumes the foreign exchange exposure  its operating margins could decrease if the operating subsidiary s currency strengthens against the contracting subsidiary s currency 
for example  our operating subsidiaries are at risk if their functional currency strengthens against the contracting subsidiary s currency typically the us dollar 
if the us dollar devalues against the operating subsidiaries functional currency  the financial results of those operating subsidiaries and teletech upon consolidation will be negatively affected 
while our hedging strategy effectively offsets a portion of these foreign currency changes  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully hedge this foreign currency exchange risk or that the value of the us dollar will not materially weaken 
if we fail to manage our foreign currency exchange risk  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to counterparty credit risk and market risk with respect to financial transactions with our financial institutions the recent global economic and credit crisis weakened the creditworthiness of many financial institutions  and in some circumstances caused previously financially solvent financial institutions to file for bankruptcy 
the counterparties to our hedge transactions are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions  and we are subject to risks that these counterparties become insolvent and fail to perform their financial obligations under these hedge transactions 
our hedging exposure to counterparty credit risk is not secured by any collateral 
if one or more of the counterparties to one or more of our hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings  we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 
our exposure will depend on many factors but  generally  our credit exposure will depend on foreign exchange rate movements relative to the contracted foreign exchange rate and whether any gains result that are not realized due to a counterparty default 
while all of our counterparty financial institutions are investment grade rated by standard poor s and moody s as of december   we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties 
we also have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that were investment grade rated at december  we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of 
table of contents these financial and other institutions and their ability to fund their obligations when required under our agreements 
our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements because we provide services to our clients customers  who reside in countries  we are subject to numerous  and sometimes conflicting  legal regimes on matters as diverse as import export controls  content requirements  trade restrictions  tariffs  taxation  sanctions  government affairs  immigration  internal and disclosure control obligations  data privacy and labor relations 
violations of these regulations could result in liability for monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution  unfavorable publicity  restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations 
due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate  local laws might be insufficient to protect our contractual and intellectual property rights  among other rights 
changes in us federal  state and international laws and regulations may adversely affect the sale of our services  including expansion of overseas operations 
in the us  some of our services must comply with various federal and state regulations regarding the method of placing outbound telephone calls 
in addition  we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients businesses that are transferred to us 
changes in these regulations and requirements  or new restrictive regulations and requirements  may slow the growth of our services or require us to incur substantial costs 
changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions  such as preventing us from using offshore resources to provide our services  or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions 
these changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets 
our financial results and projections may be impacted by our ability to maintain and find new locations for our delivery centers in countries with stable wage rates our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
as a result  our future growth is dependent upon our ability to find cost effective locations in which to operate  both domestically and internationally 
some of our delivery centers are located in countries that have experienced rising standards of living  which may in turn require us to increase employee wages 
in addition  approximately  employees outside the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although we anticipate that the terms of agreements will not impact us in a manner materially different than other companies located in these countries  we may not be able to pass increased labor costs on to our clients 
there is no assurance that we will be able to find cost effective locations 
any increases in labor costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the business process outsourcing markets are highly competitive  and we might not be able to compete effectively our ability to compete will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to initiate  develop and maintain new client relationships  maintain and expand existing client programs  staff and equip suitable delivery center facilities in a timely manner  and develop new solutions and enhance existing solutions we provide to our clients 
moreover  we compete with a variety of companies with respect to our offerings  including large multinational providers  including the service arms of large global technology providers  offshore service providers in lower cost locations that offer services similar to those we offer  often at highly competitive prices  
table of contents niche solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market  industry segment or service area  and most importantly  the in house operations of clients or potential clients 
because our primary competitors are the in house operations of existing or potential clients  our performance and growth could be adversely affected if our existing or potential clients decide to provide in house business process services they currently outsource  or retain or increase their in house business processing services and product support capabilities 
in addition  competitive pressures from current or future competitors also could cause our services to lose market acceptance or put downward pressure on the prices we charge for our services and on our operating margins 
if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to develop our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand our success depends on our ability to develop and implement systems technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry developments and client needs 
our continued growth and future profitability will be highly dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to develop new technologies that expand our existing solutions and offerings  achieve cost efficiencies in our existing delivery center operations  and introduce new solutions that leverage and respond to changing technological developments 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis 
our integration of new technologies may not achieve their intended cost reductions and services and technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our service offerings uncompetitive or obsolete 
our failure to maintain our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to recruit  hire  train and retain key executives or qualified employees  our business will be adversely affected our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit  train  and retain qualified personnel 
we generally experience high employee turnover and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force 
demand for qualified technical professionals conversant in multiple languages  including english  and or certain technologies may exceed supply  as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving technologies 
in addition  certain delivery centers are located in geographic areas with relatively low unemployment rates  which could make it more costly to hire qualified personnel 
our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting  training  or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our success is also dependent upon the efforts  direction and guidance of our executive management team 
although members of our executive team are subject to non competition agreements  they can terminate their employment at any time 
the loss of any member of our senior management team could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and growth potential 

table of contents if we fail to integrate businesses and assets that we may acquire through joint ventures or acquisitions  we may lose clients and our liquidity  capital resources and profitability may be adversely affected we may pursue joint ventures or strategic acquisitions of companies with services  technologies  industry specializations  or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business 
acquisitions and joint ventures often involve a number of special risks  including the following we may encounter difficulties integrating acquired software  operations and personnel and our management s attention could be diverted from other business concerns  we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired technology and rights into our service offerings and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the businesses or assets we acquire may fail to achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated  causing us to incur additional debt to fund operations and to write down the value of acquisitions on our financial statements  we may assume liabilities associated with the sale of the acquired company s products or services  our resources may be diverted in asserting and defending our legal rights and we may ultimately be liable for contingent and other liabilities  not previously disclosed to us  of the companies that we acquire  acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business and dilute our ownership interest  acquisitions may result in litigation from former employees or third parties  and due diligence may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  ownership rights and legal contingencies  among other matters 
we may pursue strategic alliances in the form of joint ventures and partnerships  which involve many of the same risks as acquisitions as well as additional risks associated with possible lack of control if we do not have a majority ownership position 
any of the factors identified above could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the market value of our common stock 
in addition  negotiation of potential acquisitions and the resulting integration of acquired businesses  products  or technologies  could divert management s time and resources 
future acquisitions could cause us to issue dilutive equity or incur debt  contingent liabilities  additional amortization charges from intangible assets  asset impairment charges  or write off charges for in process research and development and other indefinite lived intangible assets that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face risks related to health epidemics  which could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business could be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics  including  but not limited to  outbreaks of the hn influenza virus commonly known as the swine flu  the avian flu  and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
outbreaks of sars in and and the avian flu in  and alarmed people around the world  raising issues pertaining to health and travel and undermining confidence in the world s economy 
more recently  cases of the hn virus have been identified internationally  including confirmed human outbreaks and deaths 
any prolonged epidemic of the hn virus  avian flu  sars  or other contagious infection in the markets in which we do business may result in worker absences  lower asset utilization rates  voluntary closure of our offices and delivery centers  travel restrictions on our employees  and other disruptions to our business 
moreover  health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the closure of our offices and delivery centers 
any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business

in addition  the stock market in general  the nasdaq global select market and the market for bpo providers in particular have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies

rsus representing approximately million shares were outstanding at december   all of which were unvested 
the large number of shares issuable upon exercise of our options and other equity incentive grants could have a significant depressing effect on the market price of our stock and cause dilution to the earnings per share of our common stock

our controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud our management  including our ceo and interim cfo  believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs 
inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
while the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls  such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and such assumptions  while reasonable  may not take into account all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected

if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary teletech is one of the largest and most geographically diverse global providers of business process outsourcing solutions 
we have a year history of designing  implementing and managing critical business processes for global companies to help them improve their customers experience  expand their strategic capabilities and increase their operating efficiencies 
by delivering a high quality customer experience through the effective integration of customer facing  front office processes with internal back office processes  we enable our clients to better serve  grow and retain their customer base 
we have developed deep vertical industry expertise and support more than business process outsourcing programs serving approximately global clients in the automotive  broadband  cable  financial services  government  healthcare  logistics  media and entertainment  retail  technology  travel  and wireline and wireless communication industries 
as globalization of the world s economy continues to accelerate  businesses are increasingly competing on a large scale basis due to rapid advances in technology and telecommunications that permit cost effective real time global communications and ready access to a highly skilled worldwide labor force 
as a result of these developments  we believe that companies have increasingly outsourced business processes to third party providers in an effort to enhance or maintain their competitive position while increasing shareholder value through improved productivity and profitability 
revenue in decreased over the prior year due to the global economic slowdown resulting in a decline in our current call volumes  delayed client purchasing decisions along with the continued migration of several of our clients to our offshore delivery centers  and proactively managing underperforming and geographies out of our portfolio 
we believe that our revenue will continue to grow over the long term as global demand for our services is fueled by the following trends focus on providers who can offer fully integrated revenue generation solutions 
a focus on providers who can offer fully integrated revenue generation solutions to target new markets and improve revenue and profitability through customer acquisition  retention and growth by leveraging the profitability potential of each customer 
integration of front and back office business processes to provide increased operating efficiencies and an enhanced customer experience especially in light of the weakening global economic environment 
companies have realized that integrated business processes reduce operating costs and allow customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently resulting in higher customer satisfaction and brand loyalty thereby improving their competitive position 
a majority of our historic revenue has been derived from providing customer facing front office solutions to our clients 
given that our global delivery centers are also fully capable of providing back office solutions  we are uniquely positioned to grow our revenue by winning more back office opportunities and providing the services during non peak hours with minimal incremental investment 
furthermore  by spreading our fixed costs across a larger revenue base and increasing our asset utilization  we expect our profitability to improve over time 
increasing percentage of company operations being outsourced to most capable third party providers 
having experienced success with outsourcing a portion of their business processes  companies are increasingly inclined to outsource a larger percentage of this work

increasing adoption of outsourcing across broader groups of industries 
early adopters of the business process outsourcing trend  such as the media and communications industries  are being joined by companies in other industries  including healthcare  retail and financial services 
these companies are beginning to adopt outsourcing to improve their business processes and competitiveness 
for example  we see increasing interest in our services from companies in the healthcare  retail and financial services industries 
we believe the number of other industries that will adopt or increase their level of outsourcing will continue to grow  further enabling us to increase and diversify our revenue and client base 
focus on speed to market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations 
as companies broaden their product offerings and seek to enter new emerging markets  they are looking for outsourcing providers that can provide speed to market while reducing their capital and operating risk 
to achieve these benefits  companies are seeking bpo providers with an extensive operating history  an established global footprint  the financial strength to invest in innovation to deliver more strategic capabilities and the ability to scale and meet customer demands quickly

this capability has enhanced the flexibility of our offering allowing clients to choose our onshore  offshore or work from home employees to meet their outsourced business process needs 
in addition  we have begun to offer cloud based hosted services where clients can license any aspect of our global network and proprietary applications 
while the revenue from these offerings is small relative to our consolidated revenue  we believe it will continue to grow as these services become more widely adopted by our clients 
we aim to further improve our competitive position by investing in a growing suite of new and innovative business process services across our targeted industries 
our business strategy to increase revenue  profitability and our industry position includes the following elements capitalize on the favorable trends in the global outsourcing environment  which we believe will include more companies that want to adopt or increase bpo services  consolidate outsourcing providers with those that have a solid financial position  adequate capital resources to sustain a long term relationship and globally diverse delivery capabilities across a broad range of solutions  modify their approach to outsourcing based on total value delivered versus the lowest priced provider  create focused revenue generation capabilities in targeted market segments

effective january   we completed certain organizational changes focused on streamlining the structure of our organization to more closely align our reporting structure with our client base and increase management accountability 
beginning in the first quarter of  our north american bpo segment is comprised of sales to all clients based in north america encompassing the us and canada  while our international bpo is comprised of sales to all clients based in all countries outside of north america 
teletech revised previously reported operating segment information to conform to its new operating segments in effect as of january  on december   we completed the sale of customer solutions mauritius  an indirect subsidiary that owned a interest in our teletech services india ltd 
joint venture and generated less than of our revenue in see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this disposition 

table of contents on september   newgen results corporation and related companies hereinafter collectively referred to as newgen and teletech entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our database marketing and consulting business 
the transaction was completed on september  this business  which only represented of our revenue in  provided outsourced database management  direct marketing and related customer acquisitions and retention services for automobile dealerships and manufacturers in north america 
during  our income from operations before income taxes was reduced by million 
this included million of asset impairment and restructuring charges along with a loss on the sale of assets of million partially offset by software license income of million recorded in other  net 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the impairment charges and note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this disposition 
on december   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  newgen results corporation  filed a voluntary petition for liquidation under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
accordingly  we deconsolidated newgen results corporation as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our preparation of segment information 
bpo services the bpo business generates revenue based primarily on the amount of time our associates devote to a client s program 
we primarily focus on large global corporations in the following industries automotive  broadband  cable  financial services  government  healthcare  logistics  media and entertainment  retail  technology  travel  and wireline and wireless telecommunications 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
the majority of our revenue is from multi year contracts and we expect that trend to continue 
however  we do provide certain client programs on a short term basis 
we have historically experienced annual attrition of existing client programs of approximately to of our revenue 
attrition of existing client programs during and was and  respectively 
the bpo industry is highly competitive 
we compete primarily with the in house business processing operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain third party bpo providers 
our ability to sell our existing services or gain acceptance for new products or services is challenged by the competitive nature of the industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell services to new clients  renew relationships with existing clients  or gain client acceptance of our new products 
our ability to renew or enter into new multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  is dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which our clients operate 
a continued weakening of the us or the global economy could lengthen sales cycles or cause delays in closing new business opportunities 
our potential clients typically obtain bids from multiple vendors and evaluate many factors in selecting a service provider  including  among other factors  the scope of services offered  the service record of the vendor and price 
we generally price our bids with a long term view of profitability and  accordingly  we consider all of our fixed and variable costs in developing our bids 
we believe that our competitors  at times  may bid business based upon a short term view  as opposed to our longer term view  resulting in a lower price bid 
while we believe our clients perceptions of the value we provide results in our being successful in certain competitive bid situations  there are often situations where a potential client may prefer a lower cost 
our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
an improvement in the local or global economies where our delivery centers are located could lead to increased labor related costs 
in addition  our industry experiences high personnel turnover  and the length of training time required to implement new programs continues to increase due to increased complexities of our clients businesses 
this may create challenges if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs and need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 

table of contents to some extent our profitability is influenced by the number of new client programs entered into within the period 
for new programs we defer revenue related to initial training training revenue when training is billed as a separate component from production rates 
consequently  the corresponding training costs associated with this revenue  consisting primarily of labor and related expenses training costs  are also deferred 
in these circumstances  both the training revenue and training costs are amortized straight line over the life of the contract 
in situations where training revenue is not billed separately  but rather included in the production rates  there is no deferral as all revenue is recognized over the life of the contract and the associated training expenses are expensed as incurred 
as of december   we had deferred start up training revenue  net of training costs  of million that will be recognized into our income from operations over the remaining life of the corresponding contracts million will be recognized within the next months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of deferred training revenue and costs 
we may have difficulties managing the timeliness of launching new or expanded client programs and the associated internal allocation of personnel and resources 
this could cause slower than anticipated revenue growth and or higher than expected costs primarily related to hiring  training and retaining the required workforce  either of which could adversely affect our operating results 
quarterly  we review our capacity utilization and projected demand for future capacity 
in conjunction with these reviews  we may decide to consolidate or close under performing delivery centers  including those impacted by the loss of a major client program  in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in addition  because clients may request that we serve their customers from international delivery centers with lower prevailing labor rates  in the future we may decide to close one or more of our delivery centers  even though it is generating positive cash flow  because we believe the future profits from conducting such work outside the current delivery center may more than compensate for the one time charges related to closing the facility 
our profitability is influenced by our ability to increase capacity utilization in our delivery centers 
we attempt to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity when planning the development and opening of new delivery centers or the expansion of existing delivery centers 
as such  management considers numerous factors that affect capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations  or expansions of existing programs and the potential size and timing of new client contracts that we expect to obtain 
we continue to win new business with both new and existing clients 
to respond more rapidly to changing market demands  to implement new programs and to expand existing programs  we may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
this is largely due to the significant time required to negotiate and execute large  complex bpo client contracts and the difficulty of predicting when new programs will launch 
we internally target capacity utilization in our delivery centers at to of our available workstations 
as of december   the overall capacity utilization in our multi client centers was and was lower than the prior year due to softness of existing client volumes in light of the weakening economic environment 
the table below presents workstation data for our multi client centers as of december  and dedicated and managed centers and  workstations  at december  and  respectively are excluded from the workstation data as unused workstations in these facilities are not available for sale 
our utilization percentage is defined as the total number of utilized production workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations 
we may change the designation of shared or dedicated centers based on the normal changes in our business environment and client needs 

table of contents december  december  total total production in production in workstations in use use workstations in use use multi client centers sites open year sites open year total multi client centers while historically us based clients utilized most of our offshore delivery capabilities  we have increasingly seen clients in europe and asia pacific utilize our offshore delivery capabilities and expect this trend to continue with clients in other countries 
in light of this trend  we plan to continue to selectively expand into new offshore markets 
for example  we believe we were one of the first multi national bpo providers to enter the african continent 
as we grow our offshore delivery capabilities and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations increase  we continue to actively manage this risk via a multi currency hedging program designed to minimize operating margin volatility 
database marketing and consulting on september   newgen and teletech entered into an agreement to sell substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities associated with our database marketing and consulting business 
as a result of the transaction which was completed on september   newgen received million in cash and recorded a loss on disposal of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this disposition 
concurrent with the sale  we entered into an agreement with this buyer to provide ongoing bpo services to that segment that were previously being performed by us 
we reviewed the direct cash flows associated with this agreement and compared them to our estimates of the revenue associated with the database marketing and consulting business 
we concluded that these direct cash flows were significant 
as a result  the operations included in the database marketing and consulting business did not meet the accounting criteria and therefore was not classified as discontinued operations 
prior to the sale and as a result of the business continued losses  during june  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would dispose of our database marketing and consulting business 
this triggered impairment testing on an interim basis for this segment as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the database  marketing and consulting business recorded an impairment loss of million during the second quarter of to reduce the carrying value of their goodwill to zero 
on december   as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  newgen results corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  filed a voluntary petition for liquidation under chapter in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
according to accounting literature  the consolidation of a majority owned subsidiary is precluded where control does not rest with the majority owners 
accordingly  the company deconsolidated newgen results corporation as of december  overall as shown in the results of operations section which follows later  we have improved income from operations for our north american and international bpo segments 
the increases are attributable to a variety of factors such as expansion of work on certain client programs  transitioning work on certain client programs to lower cost operating centers  improving individual client program profit margins and or eliminating underperforming programs and our multi phased cost reduction plan 
as we pursue acquisition opportunities  it is possible that the contemplated benefits of any future acquisitions may not materialize within the expected time periods or to the extent anticipated 
critical to 
table of contents the success of our acquisition strategy is the orderly  effective integration of acquired businesses into our organization 
if this integration is unsuccessful  our business may be adversely impacted 
there is also the risk that our valuation assumptions and models for an acquisition may be overly optimistic or incorrect 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition for each client arrangement  we determine whether evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of our service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if all criteria are met  we recognize revenue at the time services are performed 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all of the criteria are met 
our bpo segments recognize revenue under three models production rate revenue is recognized based on the billable time or transactions of each associate  as defined in the client contract 
the rate per billable time or transaction is based on a pre determined contractual rate 
this contractual rate can fluctuate based on our performance against certain pre determined criteria related to quality and performance 
performance based under performance based arrangements  we are paid by our clients based on the achievement of certain levels of sales or other client determined criteria specified in the client contract 
we recognize performance based revenue by measuring our actual results against the performance criteria specified in the contracts 
amounts collected from clients prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenue  which is recorded in other short term liabilities or other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
hybrid hybrid models include production rate and performance based elements 
for these types of arrangements  we allocate revenue to the elements based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue for each element is recognized based on the methods described above 
certain client programs provide for adjustments to monthly billings based upon whether we meet or exceed certain performance criteria as set forth in the contract 
increases or decreases to monthly billings arising from such contract terms are reflected in revenue as earned or incurred 
periodically we make certain expenditures related to acquiring contracts  or providing up front discounts for future services to existing customers recorded as contract acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
those expenditures are capitalized and amortized in proportion to the expected future revenue from the contract  which in most cases results in straight line amortization over the life of the contract 
amortization of these amounts is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the authoritative guidance for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or 
table of contents tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
we continually review the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future tax periods under the more likely than not criteria 
in making this judgment  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is required 
we follow a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  and settlement of issues under audit 
interest and penalties relating to income taxes and uncertain tax positions are accrued net of tax in provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
in the future  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside our control 
our effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
further  we are subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions  in which we operate  as well as the requirements  pronouncements and ruling of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
we estimate our annual effective tax rate each quarter based on a combination of actual and forecasted results of subsequent quarters 
consequently  significant changes in our actual quarterly or forecasted results may impact the effective tax rate for the current or future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter  management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management s judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment include  among other things  the age of the identified receivable  client financial condition  previous client payment history and any recent communications with the client 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carry amount may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates 
goodwill we perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we aggregate segment components with similar economic characteristics in forming a reporting unit  aggregation can be based on types of customers  methods of distribution of services  shared operations  acquisition history  and management judgment and reporting 

table of contents we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units 
the most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services  projected labor costs  as well as contract negotiation status 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
we use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
as of december   the company s assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that the fair values of the company s reporting units were substantially in excess of their estimated carrying values  and therefore goodwill in the reporting units was not impaired 
if actual results are less than the assumptions used in performing the impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred 
restructuring liability we routinely assess the profitability and utilization of our delivery centers and existing markets 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing delivery centers and complete reductions in workforce to enhance future profitability 
we recognize certain severance liabilities when the liabilities are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than upon commitment to a plan 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing delivery centers is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant centers  which we determine based on our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords and or our ability to sublease the facility 
if our assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a reversal of previously reported losses 
equity based compensation expense equity based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value 
we recognize equity based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and recognize compensation expense only for shares that are expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is typically the vesting term of the share based payment award 
we estimate the forfeiture rate annually based on historical experience of forfeited awards 
fair value measurement the fair value guidance codifies a new framework for measuring fair value and expands related disclosures 
the framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  assumptions about counterparty credit risk  including the ability of each party to execute its obligation under the contract  and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to utilize the best available information 
accordingly  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs 
the valuation techniques required by the new provisions establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices 
table of contents in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange traded derivatives  listed equities and us government treasury securities 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors  and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
instruments in this category include non exchange traded derivatives such as over the counter forwards  options and repurchase agreements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
level instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers needs 
at each balance sheet date  we perform an analysis of all instruments subject to fair value measurements and includes in level all of those whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs 
derivatives we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are associated with forecasted revenue in non functional currencies 
upon proper qualification  these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
we also entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our net investment in a foreign operation 
all derivative financial instruments are reported on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  to the extent they are deemed effective 
based on the criteria established by current accounting standards  all of our cash flow hedge contracts are deemed to be highly effective 
changes in fair value of any net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of our net investment in the foreign operation 
any realized gains or losses resulting from the cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transaction within revenue 
gains and losses from the settlements of our net investment hedge remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until partial or complete liquidation of the applicable net investment 
we also enter into fair value derivative contracts that hedge against translation gains and losses 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged  with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being recognized in earnings 
while we expect that our derivative instruments will continue to be highly effective and in compliance with applicable accounting standards  if our hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if we determine that 
table of contents forecasted transactions will not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected currently in earnings 
in addition to hedging activities  we also have embedded derivatives in certain foreign lease contracts 
we bifurcate and fair value the embedded derivative feature from the host contract with any changes in fair value of the embedded derivatives recognized in cost of services 
contingencies we record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  management reviews all litigation and claims on a case by case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss 
explanation of key metrics and other items cost of services cost of services principally include costs incurred in connection with our bpo operations and database marketing services  including direct labor  telecommunications  printing  postage  sales and use tax and certain fixed costs associated with delivery centers 
in addition  cost of services includes income related to grants we may receive from local or state governments as an incentive to locate delivery centers in their jurisdictions which reduce the cost of services for those facilities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with administrative services such as sales  marketing  product development  legal settlements  legal  information systems including core technology and telephony infrastructure and accounting and finance 
it also includes equity based compensation expense  outside professional fees ie  legal and accounting services  building expense for non delivery center facilities and other items associated with general business administration 
restructuring charges  net restructuring charges  net primarily include costs incurred in conjunction with reductions in force or decisions to exit facilities  including termination benefits and lease liabilities  net of expected sublease rentals 
interest expense interest expense includes interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our debts and capitalized lease obligations 
other income the main components of other income are miscellaneous income not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction gains 
other expenses the main components of other expenses are expenditures not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction losses 
presentation of non gaap measurements free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap liquidity measurement 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property  plant and equipment 
free cash flow is not a measure determined by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for income from operations  net income  net cash provided by operating activities  or any other measure determined in 
table of contents accordance with gaap 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful  in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities  because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
free cash flow also excludes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions  investments and other needs that may arise 
the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for our consolidated results amounts in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  plant and equipment free cash flow purchases of property  plant and equipment for the years ended december  and are net of proceeds from a government grant of million and million  respectively 
we discuss factors affecting free cash flow between periods in the liquidity and capital resources section below

table of contents revenue revenue for north american bpo for compared to was million and  million  respectively 
the decrease in revenue for the north american bpo was due to net decreases in client programs of million  along with certain program terminations of million  and a million decrease due to realized losses on cash flow hedges purchased to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for revenue delivered in a different country from where the client is located 
revenue for international bpo for compared to was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in revenue for the international bpo was due to a net increase in client programs of million  offset by certain program terminations of million  and negative changes in foreign exchange translation rates causing a decrease in revenue of million 
our strategy of continuing to increase our offshore revenue delivery resulted in an increase in our percentage of offshore revenue 
our offshore delivery capacity now represents of our global delivery capabilities at december  revenue in these offshore locations was million and represented of our total revenue for revenue in these offshore locations was million and represented of our total revenue for an important component of our growth strategy is continued international expansion which is one of several factors contributing to our higher margins along with increased technology and consulting related projects 
factors that may impact our ability to maintain our offshore operating margins include potential increases in competition for the available workforce  the trend of higher occupancy costs and foreign currency fluctuations 
cost of services cost of services for north american bpo for compared to was million and million  respectively 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue in the north american bpo decreased compared to the prior year 
in absolute dollars the decrease was due to a million decrease in employee related expenses due to lower volumes in existing client programs and program terminations  a million decrease for telecommunications expense due to reductions in client volume and the closure of several delivery centers  a million decrease for rent and related expenses due to the closure of several delivery centers  and a million net decrease in other expenses 
cost of services for international bpo for compared to was million and million  respectively 
cost of services as a percentage of revenue in the international bpo increased slightly compared to the prior year

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis for and was million and million  respectively 
for the north american bpo  the depreciation expense decreased in absolute value while it increased slightly as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior year 
this decrease in value was due to restructuring activities and delivery center closures which have better aligned our capacity to our operational needs 
for the international bpo  the depreciation expense decreased in absolute value while it increased as a percentage of revenue as compared to the prior year 
during we shortened the useful life of certain telephony assets  resulting in the acceleration of million of depreciation expense in the period in the international bpo 
this increase was offset by decreases in depreciation expense due to delivery center closures which have better aligned our capacity to our operational needs 
restructuring charges during  we recorded a net million of restructuring charges compared to million in during  we undertook reductions in both our north american bpo and international bpo segments to better align our capacity and workforce with the current business needs 
we recorded million in severance related expenses  and million in delivery center closure costs in both the north american bpo and international bpo segments 
we also recorded a million reduction in several of our estimates of previously recorded delivery center closure charges 
during  we undertook several restructuring activities including the closure of four north american bpo delivery centers and reductions in force in our international bpo segment to better align our capacity and workforce with current business needs 
impairment losses during  we recorded million of impairment charges compared to million of impairment charges in in  this impairment charge related to the reduction of the net book value of certain leasehold improvements in both the north american bpo and international bpo segments 
in  these impairment charges related primarily to the closure of two north american bpo delivery centers 
other income expense for  interest income decreased to million from million in  primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalent balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense decreased during by million due to a lower average outstanding balance on our line of credit and lower interest rates 
other income increased during by million primarily due to changes in foreign exchange rates which caused a shift from foreign currency losses to foreign currency gains 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was 
this compares to an effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate is positively influenced by earnings in international jurisdictions currently under an income tax holiday and the distribution of income between the us and international tax jurisdictions

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations  our cash and cash equivalents  and borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement  dated september  the credit facility 
during the year ended december   we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents  and available credit will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we manage a centralized global treasury function in the united states with a particular focus on concentrating and safeguarding our global cash and cash equivalent reserves 
while we generally prefer to hold us dollars  we maintain adequate cash in the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries to support local operating costs 
while there are no assurances  we believe our global cash is protected given our cash management practices  banking partners  and low risk investments 

table of contents we have global operations that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may positively or negatively impact our liquidity 
to mitigate these risks  we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts through our cash flow hedging program 
please refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency risk  for further discussion 
we primarily utilize our credit facility to fund working capital  stock repurchases  and other strategic and general operating purposes 
in september  we exercised the upsizing feature under the credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional million  which increased the total commitments to million 
as of december  and december   we had zero and million in outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  respectively 
after consideration for issued letters of credit under the credit facility  totaling million  our remaining borrowing capacity was million as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our credit facility 
the amount of capital required over the next months will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain  upgrade or replace existing assets 
our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could also increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures  among other factors 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available  at all  or on terms favorable to us 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december    and cash and cash equivalents we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their original maturity to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities we reinvest our cash flows from operating activities in our business or in the purchase of our outstanding stock 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
our cash from operating activities in was relatively unchanged from the increase from to was primarily due to an increase in net income of million  greater collections of accounts receivable of million offset by decreases in impairment losses of million 
cash flows from investing activities we reinvest cash in our business primarily to grow our client base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows used in investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily due to a million reduction in net capital expenditures 
the increase from to was primarily due to the disposition of two of our entities 
cash flows from financing activities for the years  and  we reported net cash flows used in financing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the change from to was due to an increase in net payments on our line of credit of million offset by decreased purchases of common stock of million 
the change from to was due to increased purchases of our outstanding stock of million  increased net borrowings on the line of credit of million offset by a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises of million 

table of contents free cash flow free cash flow see presentation of non gaap measurements for definition of free cash flow was million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the increase from to resulted primarily from a decrease in capital expenditures

obligations and future capital requirements future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows amounts in thousands less than to to over year years years years total credit facility capital lease obligations equipment financing arrangements purchase obligations operating lease commitments total contractual obligations to be paid in a foreign currency are translated at the period end exchange rate 
purchase obligations primarily consist of outstanding purchase orders for goods or services not yet received  which are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets until such goods and or services are received 
the contractual obligation table excludes liabilities of million related to uncertain tax positions because we cannot reliably estimate the timing of future cash payments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
purchase obligations occasionally we contract with certain of our communications clients which currently represent approximately of our annual revenue to provide us with telecommunication services 
we believe these contracts are negotiated on an arm s length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
future capital requirements we expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
approximately of the expected capital expenditures in are related to the opening and or growth of our delivery platform and relates to the maintenance capital required for existing assets and internal technology projects 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirements for additional delivery center capacity as well as enhancements to our technological infrastructure 
we may consider restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
such transactions could include the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures or the incurrence  assumption  or refinancing of indebtedness and could be material to the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of our operations 
in addition  as of december   we are authorized to purchase an additional million of common stock under our stock repurchase program see part ii item of this form k 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
the launch of large client contracts may result in short term negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program and the beginning of the 
table of contents accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
debt instruments and related covenants our credit facility  dated september   permits borrowing up to a maximum of million 
the credit facility expires on september  and allows us to request a one year extension beyond the maturity date subject to unanimous approval by the lenders 
the credit facility is collateralized by the majority of our domestic accounts receivable and a pledge of of the capital stock of specified material foreign subsidiaries 
our domestic subsidiaries are guarantors under the credit facility 
the credit facility  which includes customary financial covenants  may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  purchases of treasury stock and acquisition financing 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and were in compliance with all financial covenants 
borrowings accrue interest at a rate based on either prime rate  defined as the higher of the lender s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  or the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable credit spread  at our option 
the interest rate and unused commitment fees also vary based on our leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
during  borrowings accrued interest at an average rate of approximately per annum 
in addition  we paid unused commitment fees at a rate of per annum 
as of december  and  we had outstanding borrowings under the credit facility of zero and million  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings as of december  was approximately 
availability was million as of december   reduced from million by million in issued letters of credit 
client concentration our five largest clients accounted for  and of our annual revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis and varies greatly based upon specific contract terms 
in addition  clients may adjust business volumes served by us based on their business requirements 
we believe the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
although certain client contracts may be terminated for convenience by either party  this risk is mitigated  in part  by the service level disruptions and transition migration costs that would arise for our clients 
the contracts with our five largest clients expire between and additionally  a particular client may have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed or  if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we discuss the potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
market risk also includes credit and non performance risk by counterparties to our various financial instruments  our banking partners 
we are exposed to market risks due to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar  as well as credit risk associated with potential non performance of our counterparty banks 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as discussed below  we enter into derivative instruments to manage and reduce the impact of currency exchange rate changes  primarily between the us dollar canadian dollar  the us dollar philippine peso  the us dollar mexican peso  the us dollar argentine peso  and the us dollar s 
african rand 
in order to mitigate 
table of contents against credit and non performance risk  it is our policy to only enter into derivative contracts and other financial instruments with investment grade counterparty financial institutions and  correspondingly  our derivative valuations reflect the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced  nor do we anticipate  any issue related to derivative counterparty defaults 
interest rate risk the interest rate on our credit facility is variable based upon the prime rate and the libor and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance under the credit facility 
however  based upon the annual average borrowing rate of and an average borrowed balance of million  if the prime rate or libor increased basis points  there would not be a material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency risk our subsidiaries in argentina  canada  costa rica  malaysia  mexico  the philippines and south africa use the local currency as their functional currency for paying labor and other operating costs 
conversely  revenue for these foreign subsidiaries is derived principally from client contracts that are invoiced and collected in us dollars or other foreign currencies 
as a result  we may experience foreign currency gains or losses  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries 
for the years ended december   and  revenue associated with this foreign exchange risk was  and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
in order to mitigate the risk of these non functional foreign currencies from weakening against the functional currency of the servicing subsidiary  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  though not  of the projected foreign currency exposure related to client programs served from these foreign countries through our cash flow hedging program 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term  an overall weakening of the non functional foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the segments of the contracting subsidiary over the long term

us dollar cash flow hedging program to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with forecasted revenue in non functional currencies  we purchase forward and or option contracts to acquire the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary at a fixed exchange rate at specific dates in the future 
we have designated and account for these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue in non functional currencies 
while we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we cannot ensure that we will not recognize gains or losses from international transactions  as this is part of transacting business in an international environment 
not every exposure is or can be hedged and  where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign exchange exposure  
table of contents they are based on forecasts for which actual results may differ from the original estimate

table of contents we recorded net gains losses of million  million  and million for settled cash flow hedge contracts and the related premiums for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these gains losses are reflected in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
if the exchange rates between our various currency pairs were to increase or decrease by from current period end levels  we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts 
however  any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains or losses in our underlying exposures 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in their respective local currencies 
however  transactions are denominated in other currencies from time to time 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we endeavor to settle these accounts on a timely basis
