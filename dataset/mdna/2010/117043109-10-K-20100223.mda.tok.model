overview and outlook general in  brunswick continued its restructuring activities in order to operate effectively in a difficult economy and marine industry  while positioning itself to take advantage of market opportunities as they evolve  and maintaining its strategic objective to solidify its leadership position in the marine  fitness and bowling and billiards industries  by maintaining strong liquidity during difficult economic times  focusing on cost reduction initiatives across the organization through the resizing and realignment of brunswick s manufacturing operations and organizational structure  continuing to shrink and consolidate its manufacturing footprint to a level that allows each facility to produce at higher volumes and lower costs  and lowering its marine production levels to achieve reductions in pipeline inventories held by its dealers in order to maintain the health of the company s many dealers in a difficult retail environment 
actions in support of the company s strategic objectives in include maintaining liquidity increased its overall liquidity and reduced its net debt position  when compared with the end of  through cost reduction efforts  combined with inventory management strategies  reduced its near term debt obligations through a million debt offering due in the company used a portion of the proceeds to repay percent of the company s notes due in and to reduce the amount of its notes outstanding to million  representing the only significant long term debt maturity from to  and ended the year with million of cash  compared with million at the end of  despite a significant reduction in sales and a difficult economy 
cost reduction initiatives and manufacturing realignment achieved the company s goal of reducing its fixed cost structure compared with by approximately million through continued reduction of the company s global workforce  consolidation of manufacturing operations and disposition of non strategic assets  reduced total company workforce by percent in and percent since  removed approximately  boats  or percent  from dealer pipeline inventories  and further adjusted the boat manufacturing footprint to streamline operations by having several plants manufacture multiple brands  rather than having dedicated facilities for single brands  and reduced the number of boat models being manufactured in order to better utilize the new footprint and to reduce complexity and costs 
dealer health announced plans to consolidate engine production by transferring sterndrive engine manufacturing operations from its stillwater  oklahoma plant to its fond du lac  wisconsin plant  which currently produces the company s outboard engines  maintained the company s dealer network by replacing those dealers who were underperforming and or exiting the market with healthier dealers in the same territories  thereby ensuring adequate brand representation 
the company experienced a net loss of boat brand representation at dealers of approximately percent 
brunswick incurred financial losses in due to continued weakness in marine markets  contracting global credit markets and the effects of its restructuring and dealer health actions 
net sales from continuing operations in decreased to  million from  million in the overall decrease in sales was primarily due to the continued reduction in marine industry demand as a result of a weak global economy  soft housing markets and the contraction of liquidity in global credit markets 
the reduction in marine industry demand is evidenced by the declining number of retail unit sales of powerboats in the united states since  with the rate of decline accelerating throughout industry retail unit sales were down significantly during compared with the already low retail unit sales during in  the company reported lower sales across all segments and global regions 
operating losses from continuing operations for were million  with negative operating margins of percent 
operating losses from continuing operations for were million  with negative operating margins of percent 
the results included million of restructuring  exit and impairment charges  while the results included goodwill and trade name impairment charges of million and million of restructuring  exit and impairment charges 
the lower operating losses during primarily resulted from the absence of goodwill and trade name impairment charges and the benefit of cost reduction initiatives  as discussed in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these factors were partially offset by lower sales across all segments  higher pension expense  the absence of variable compensation and defined contribution accruals in  higher dealer incentive programs and sales discounts and reduced fixed cost absorption due to reduced production rates in the company s marine businesses 
restructuring activities in november  brunswick announced restructuring initiatives to improve the company s cost structure  better utilize overall capacity and improve general operating efficiencies 
as the marine market entered a sustained decline in  brunswick expanded its restructuring activities during  and in order to improve performance and better position the company to address current market conditions and enable long term profitable growth 
these initiatives have resulted in the recognition of restructuring  exit and impairment charges in the statement of operations during  and total restructuring  exit and impairment charges in were million which consists of million in the marine engine segment  million in the boat segment  million in the fitness segment  million in the bowling billiards segment and million at corporate 
see note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
the actions taken under these initiatives will benefit future operations as the company has removed fixed costs of approximately million from cost of sales and approximately million from selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations when compared with spending levels 
the majority of these costs are cash savings 
the company anticipates it will incur approximately million of additional charges in related to known restructuring activities that will be initiated in or have been initiated in goodwill and trade name impairments brunswick accounts for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with accounting standards codification asc intangibles goodwill and other asc 
under this standard  brunswick assesses the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company did not record any goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset impairments during after completing its annual impairment test 
while the company has a plan to restore itself to profitability  as discussed in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements  it has no assurance that the plan will be achieved or that the company will return to profitability in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the company may be required to take an impairment charge in a future period if it experiences any significant adverse changes in its businesses or as part of its annual impairment testing for goodwill to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill may not be recoverable 
as of december   the carrying value of goodwill at the company s fitness and marine engine segments was million and million  respectively 
while the company does not believe it will incur an impairment loss on its marine engine segment  a reasonable possibility exists that an impairment loss might be required for the fitness segment in future periods 
the fitness segment s fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately percent during the testing performed in the outcome of the testing performed is largely dependent on the segment s forecasted future cash flows and the selection of an appropriate discount rate to apply to those future cash flows 
the fitness segment s fourth quarter has historically represented approximately percent of the segment s operating earnings for the entire year  and as a result  the operating earnings in future fourth quarters will have a significant impact on the company s forecasted future cash flows used in the annual goodwill impairment test 
during the third quarter of  brunswick encountered a significant adverse change in the business climate 
a weak us economy  soft housing markets and the contraction of liquidity in global credit markets contributed to the continued reduction in demand for certain brunswick products and  consequently  reduced wholesale production rates for those affected products 
as a result of this reduced demand  along with lower than projected profits across certain brunswick brands and lower commitments received from its dealer network in the third quarter  management revised its future cash flow expectations in the third quarter of  which lowered the fair value estimates of certain businesses 
as a result of the lower fair value estimates  brunswick concluded that the carrying amounts of its boat segment and bowling retail and billiards reporting units within the bowling billiards segment exceeded their respective fair values 
the company compared the implied fair value of the goodwill in each reporting unit with the carrying value and concluded that a million pretax impairment charge needed to be recognized in the third quarter of of this amount  million related to the boat segment reporting unit  million related to the bowling retail reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment 
the company also recognized goodwill impairment charges of million in the boat segment reporting unit and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment earlier in as a result of deciding to exit certain businesses 
as a result of the million of impairments  all goodwill at these respective reporting units has been written down to zero 
in conjunction with the goodwill impairment testing  the company analyzed the valuation of its other indefinite lived intangibles  consisting of acquired trade names 
brunswick estimated the fair value of trade names by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the relief from royalty approach 
this approach treats the trade name as if it were licensed by the company rather than owned  and calculates its value based on the discounted cash flow of the projected license payments 
the analysis resulted in a pretax trade name impairment charge of million in the third quarter of  representing the excess of the carrying cost of the trade names over the calculated fair value 
of this amount  million related to the boat segment reporting unit  million related to the marine engine segment reporting unit and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment 
the company also recognized trade name impairment charges of million in the boat segment reporting unit and million related to the billiards reporting unit within the bowling billiards segment earlier in as a result of deciding to exit certain businesses 
discontinued operations as discussed in note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements  in april  the company announced its intention to sell the majority of the brunswick new technologies bnt business unit  consisting of the company s marine electronics  portable navigation device pnd and wireless fleet tracking businesses 
during the second quarter of  brunswick began reporting the results of these bnt businesses  which were previously reported in the marine engine segment  as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company s results  as discussed in management s discussion and analysis  reflect continuing operations only  unless otherwise noted 
the company completed the divestiture of the bnt discontinued operations in outlook for looking ahead to  the company expects revenues to be higher when compared with  primarily in the marine engine and boat segments 
the expectation of higher revenues is a result of the company s expected marine wholesale shipments in more closely matching marine retail demand  whereas wholesale shipments were significantly lower than retail sales 
in addition  the company expects to offer reduced discounts to incent marine retail demand for prior model year boats 
the company also expects the fitness and bowling billiards segments to experience a modest growth in revenues 
due to higher sales and production volumes in the company s marine segments  gross margins are expected to be improved and operating losses are expected to be significantly reduced 
actions in to lower dealer pipeline inventories are expected to have a favorable effect on margins due to reduced discounts on higher sales volumes and higher fixed cost absorption on increased production 
contributing to the decline in expected operating losses for the company are lower restructuring  exit and impairment charges  and decreased pension and bad debt expenses 
an increase in interest expense in is expected to partially offset the improvement in operating losses 
excluding the effect of any special tax items that may occur or any changes to legislation  the company s tax provision or benefit in will primarily be related to its state and foreign earnings or losses as the company will continue to provide deferred tax asset valuation allowances on its anticipated domestic federal tax losses in matters affecting comparability the following events have occurred during  and  which the company believes affect the comparability of the results of operations goodwill impairment charges 
in  the company incurred million of goodwill impairment charges 
this was a result of the continued reduction in demand for certain products  along with lower than projected profits across certain brands  which led management to revise its future cash flow expectations in the third quarter of the revised future cash flow expectations resulted in the company lowering its estimate of fair value of certain businesses and required the company to take a million pretax goodwill impairment charge during the third quarter of  as prescribed by asc additionally  impairments were recorded in the second quarter of related to the analyses of its baja boat business and its valley dynamo coin operated commercial billiards business

additionally  impairments were recorded in the second quarter of related to analyses of its bluewater marine boat business bluewater marine group  which previously manufactured the sea pro  sea boss  palmetto and laguna brands of fishing boats  and its valley dynamo coin operated commercial billiards business

the reduction in the valuation allowance  as a result of other comprehensive income  was a million income tax benefit during the company also filed its federal income tax return in the third quarter of  which generated an additional million income tax benefit in partially offsetting these tax benefits was the recording of a million tax valuation allowance in the first quarter of to reduce certain state and foreign net deferred tax assets to their anticipated realizable value 
the remaining realizable value was determined by evaluating the potential to recover the value of these assets through the utilization of loss carrybacks 
during  the company recognized a tax provision of million on operating losses from continuing operations of million for an effective tax rate of percent 
typically  the company would recognize a tax benefit on operating losses  however  due to the uncertainty of the realization of certain net deferred tax assets  a provision of million was recognized to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
see note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
during  the company recognized special tax benefits of million  primarily as a result of favorable tax reassessments and its election to apply the indefinite reversal criterion asc income taxes to the undistributed net earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries  which are intended to be permanently reinvested  as discussed in note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these benefits were partially offset by expense related to changes in estimates of prior years tax return filings and the impact of a foreign jurisdiction tax rate reduction on the underlying net deferred tax asset

the decrease in net sales was primarily due to reduced global demand for the company s products and services across all segments compared with  most notably in the marine industry 
the continued uncertainty in the global economy and increased credit constraints have limited the company s retail and other customers purchasing power and have curtailed both retail and wholesale activity 
as a result of the prolonged decline in marine retail demand and tighter credit markets  a number of the company s dealers have filed for bankruptcy or voluntarily ceased operations 
as a result  the company has repurchased company product from finance companies under contractual repurchase obligations and resold the repurchased inventory to stronger dealers 
if additional dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations  the company s net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of lower market coverage and the associated decline in sales 
the decline in the marine engine segment s net sales was less severe than the percentage reduction in the boat segment s net sales for the year due to continued customer purchases in from the marine engine segment s marine service  parts and accessories businesses 
net sales in the fitness and bowling billiards segments also declined during the year as operators in these industries continue to experience reduced access to capital and remained cautious about making capital purchases

the increase in working capital was primarily the result of reductions in the company s accounts payable and accrued expenses relating to the reduced level of production activity  largely in the marine engine and boat segments  and lower accrued discounts 
these declines were partially offset by lower inventories and lower trade receivables  which were driven by reduced demand for the company s marine products 
partially offsetting the changes in working capital were the company s operating results  which provided cash during after adjusting the net loss on continuing operations for non cash charges such as goodwill  trade name and other long lived asset impairments  charges associated with recording additional tax valuation allowances and adding back depreciation and amortization

in may  the company entered into the mercury receivables abl facility with ge commercial distribution finance corporation gecdf to replace the mercury marine accounts receivable sale program the company had with brunswick acceptance company  llc bac as described in note financial services 
the mercury receivables abl facility agreement provides for a base level of borrowings of million that are secured by the domestic accounts receivable of mercury marine  a division of the company  at a borrowing rate  set at the beginning of each month  equal to the one month libor rate plus percent  provided  however  that the one month libor rate shall not be less than percent 
borrowings under the mercury receivables abl facility can be adjusted to million to accommodate seasonal increases in accounts receivable from may to august 
borrowing availability under this facility is subject to a borrowing base consisting of mercury marine domestic accounts receivable  adjusted for eligibility requirements  with an percent advance rate 
the company was also able to borrow an additional million in excess of the borrowing base according to the over advance feature through november  which is now declining ratably each month through november borrowings under the mercury receivables abl facility are further limited to the lesser of the total amount available under the mercury receivables abl facility or the mercury marine receivables  excluding certain amounts  pledged as collateral against the mercury receivables abl facility 
the mercury receivables abl facility also includes a financial covenant  which corresponds to the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant included in the company s revolving credit facility and the bac joint venture agreement described in note financial services 
the mercury receivables abl facility s term will expire concurrently with the termination of bac  by the company with days notice or by gecdf upon the company s default under the mercury receivables abl facility  including failure to comply with the facility s financial covenant 
initial borrowings under the mercury receivables abl facility were million 
the company has since reduced the borrowings outstanding and ended with no borrowings under this facility

the borrowing base had a value of million  excluding cash  as of december  the company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at december  letters of credit outstanding under the facility totaled million as of december   resulting in unused borrowing capacity of million 
however  the company s borrowing capacity is also affected by the facility s minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
this covenant requires that the company meet a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test only if unused borrowing capacity under the facility falls below million 
if unused borrowing capacity under the facility exceeds million  the company need not meet the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
due to current operating performance  the company s fixed charge coverage ratio was below the minimum requirement at the end of however  because the company s unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility exceeded million at the end of the year  the company is in compliance with the covenant 
taking into account the minimum availability requirement  the company s unused borrowing capacity is effectively reduced by million to million in order to maintain compliance with the covenant 
the company expects unused borrowing capacity under the facility to continue to exceed million and therefore to be in compliance with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant during management believes that the company has adequate sources of liquidity to meet the company s short term and long term needs 
through actions taken in  the company has reduced its near term debt obligations  including the repayment of percent of its notes due in and the reduction of the amounts outstanding on its notes to million  representing the only significant long term debt maturity from to management expects that the company s near term operating cash requirements  which have declined due to lower spending  will be met out of existing cash balances and free cash flow 
specifically  the company is anticipating significantly reduced losses from continuing operations and restructuring activities in from increasing sales as the year progresses and plans on maintaining flat year over year working capital levels by increasing inventory turns  in line with historical levels  and reducing days sales outstanding in its accounts receivable

in  the company anticipates receiving approximately million of additional funding  primarily from government programs  in connection with its plant consolidation activities in fond du lac  wisconsin 
based on the factors described above  the company believes it will end with net debt levels comparable to the end of continued weakness in the marine marketplace may jeopardize the financial stability of the company s dealers 
specifically  dealer inventory levels may increase to levels higher than desired  inventory may be aged beyond preferred levels and dealers may experience reduced cash flow 
these factors may impair a dealer s ability to meet payment obligations to the company or to third party financing sources and to obtain financing to purchase new product 
if a dealer is unable to meet its obligations to third party financing sources  brunswick may be required to repurchase a portion of its own products from these third party financing sources

legal proceedings see note commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosure of the potential cash requirements related to legal and environmental proceedings 
environmental regulations in its marine engine segment  brunswick will continue to develop engine technologies to reduce engine emissions to comply with current and future emissions requirements 
the costs associated with these activities may have an adverse effect on marine engine segment operating margins and may affect short term operating results 
the state of california adopted regulations that required catalytic converters on sterndrive and inboard engines that became effective on january  the epa adopted similar environmental regulations governing engine sales  effective january  other environmental regulatory bodies in the united states and other countries may also impose higher emissions standards than are currently in effect for those regions 
the company expects to comply fully with these regulations  but compliance will increase the cost of these products for the company and the industry 
the boat segment continues to pursue fiberglass boat manufacturing technologies and techniques to reduce air emissions at its boat manufacturing facilities 
the company does not believe that compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws will have a material adverse effect on brunswick s competitive position 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
if current estimates for the cost of resolving any specific matters are later determined to be inadequate  results of operations could be adversely affected in the period in which additional provisions are required 
the company records a reserve when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company establishes its reserve based on its best estimate within a range of losses 
if the company is unable to identify the best estimate  the company records the minimum amount in the range 
the company has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and believes the following are the most critical accounting policies that could have an effect on brunswick s reported results 
revenue recognition and sales incentives 
the company s revenue is derived primarily from the sale of marine engines  parts and accessories  boats  fitness equipment  bowling products  retail bowling activities and billiards tables 
revenue is recognized in accordance with the terms of the sale  primarily upon shipment to customers  once the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
brunswick offers discounts and sales incentives that include retail promotional activities and rebates 
the estimated liability for sales incentives is recorded at the later of the time of program communication to the customer or at the time of sale 
the liability is estimated based on the costs for the incentive program  the planned duration of the program and historical experience 
if actual costs are different from estimated costs  the recorded value of the liability and revenue is adjusted 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for uncollectible trade receivables based upon currently known bad debt risks and provides reserves based on loss history  customer payment practices and economic conditions 
actual collection experience may differ from the current estimate of reserves 
the company also provides a reserve based on historical  current and estimated future purchasing levels in connection with its long term notes receivable for brunswick s supply agreements 
these assumptions are re evaluated considering the customer s financial position and product purchase volumes 
changes to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required if a future event or other circumstance results in a change in the estimate of the ultimate collectibility of a specific account or note 
reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records a reserve for excess and obsolete inventories in order to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value 
fair market value can be affected by assumptions about market demand and conditions  historical usage rates  model changes and new product introductions 
if model changes or new product introductions create more or less than favorable market conditions  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventories may need to be adjusted 
warranty reserves 
the company records a liability for standard product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the liability is recorded using historical warranty experience to estimate projected claim rates and expected costs per claim 
if necessary  the company adjusts its liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
the company s warranty reserves are affected by product failure rates and material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if these estimated costs differ from actual product failure rates and actual material usage and labor costs  a revision to the warranty reserve would be required 
restructuring 
from time to time  the company engages in actions associated with cost reduction initiatives 
the company s restructuring actions require significant estimates including a expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  b remaining lease obligations  including sublease income  and c other exit costs 
the company has accrued amounts that it believes are its best estimates of the obligations it expects to incur in connection with these actions  but these estimates are subject to change due to market conditions and final negotiations 
should the actual amounts differ from the originally estimated amounts  brunswick s earnings could decrease 
the company recognized million  million and million in restructuring charges in  and  respectively  which are discussed in more detail in note restructuring activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in assessing the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  management relies on a number of factors to value anticipated future cash flows including operating results  business plans and present value techniques 
rates used to value and discount cash flows are dependent upon royalty rate assumptions  interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management must exercise its judgment in applying them to the analysis of intangible asset impairment 
it is possible that operating results or assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner that impairment in value may occur in the future 
long lived assets 
in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  asc  the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite lived intangible assets  excluding goodwill  and other long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
the company tested its long lived asset balances for impairment as triggering events occurred during  and  resulting in impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  which are recognized in restructuring  exit and impairment charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
litigation 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to claims and litigation  including obligations assumed or retained as part of acquisitions and divestitures 
the company accrues for litigation exposure based upon its assessment  made in consultation with counsel  of the likely range of exposure stemming from the claim 
in light of existing reserves  the company s litigation claims  when finally resolved  will not  in the opinion of management  have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position

actual costs associated with a specific claim can vary from an earlier estimate 
if the facts were to change  the liability recorded for expected costs associated with a specific claim may need to be revised

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company enters into various hedging transactions to mitigate these risks in accordance with guidelines established by the company s management 
the company does not use financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company uses foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage foreign exchange rate exposure related to anticipated transactions  and assets and liabilities that are subject to risk from foreign currency rate changes 
the company s principal currency exposures relate to the euro  japanese yen  canadian dollar  australian dollar  british pound and new zealand dollar 
hedging of anticipated transactions is accomplished with financial instruments whose maturity date  along with the realized gain or loss  occurs on or near the execution of the anticipated transaction 
the company manages foreign currency exposure of assets or liabilities through the use of derivative financial instruments such that the gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument offsets the loss or gain recognized on the asset or liability  respectively 
raw materials used by the company are exposed to the effect of changing commodity prices 
accordingly  the company uses commodity swap agreements  futures contracts and supplier agreements to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated purchases of certain raw materials  including aluminum and natural gas 
the following analyses provide quantitative information regarding the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk 
the company uses a model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and commodity prices 
for options and instruments with nonlinear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain shortcomings inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion 
the amounts shown below represent the estimated reduction in fair market value that the company would incur on its derivative financial instruments from a percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency rates  and commodity prices 
in millions risk category foreign exchange commodity prices
