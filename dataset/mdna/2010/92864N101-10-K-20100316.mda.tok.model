overview we are an innovative designer  marketer and distributor of premium quality young mens and young womens clothing  footwear  accessories and related products under the volcom brand name 
we seek to offer products that appeal to participants in skateboarding  snowboarding  surfing and motocross  and those who affiliate themselves with the broader action sports lifestyle 
our products  which include  among others  t shirts  fleece  bottoms  tops  jackets  boardshorts  denim  outerwear  sandals  girls swimwear and a complete collection of kids and boys clothing  combine fashion  functionality and athletic performance 
we develop and introduce products that we believe set the industry standard for style and quality in each of our product categories 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding membership interests of electric visual evolution llc  or electric  for million plus transaction costs of million 
known for its volt logo  electric is a core action sports lifestyle brand 
electric s growing product line includes sunglasses  goggles  t shirts  bags  hats  belts and other accessories 
as part of our strategy to take direct control of our european operations  we constructed a new european headquarters in anglet  france  which was completed in february  and delivered our first full season product line during the third quarter of we furthered our international expansion in by completing the acquisition of our distributor of volcom branded products in japan 
in  we took direct control of the volcom brand in the united kingdom 
domestically  in  we acquired the assets of laguna surf sport  a california based retail chain currently operating two retail stores 
volcom branded products are currently sold throughout the united states and in over countries internationally by either us or international licensees 
we serve the united states  europe  canada  latin america  asia pacific and puerto rico through our in house sales personnel  independent sales representatives and distributors 
in these areas  volcom branded products are sold to retailers that we believe merchandise our products in an environment that supports and reinforces our brand image and provide a superior in store experience 
our retail customers are primarily specialty boardsports retailers and several retail chains 
in australia  indonesia  south africa  brazil and argentina including paraguay and uruguay  we license the volcom brand to entities that we believe have local market insight and strong relationships with retailers in their respective territories 
we receive royalties on the sales of volcom branded products sold by our licensees 
our license agreements specify quality  design  marketing and distribution standards for the volcom branded products distributed by our licensees 
our licensees are not controlled and operated by us  and the amount of our licensing revenues could decrease in the future 
as these license agreements expire  we may assume direct responsibility for serving these licensed territories 
we established our own operations in europe in anticipation of the expiration of the licensing agreement with our european licensee on december  pursuant to an agreement between us and volcom europe our former european licensee  volcom europe produced and distributed the spring volcom line in europe and paid us our same royalty rate as required under the license agreement 
as a result  we experienced a decrease in our licensing revenues and an increase in our selling  
table of contents general and administrative expense while we built the necessary infrastructure and hired employees to establish and support our own operations in europe 
our product revenues have increased in europe as we now recognize revenue from the direct sale of our products in this territory 
our revenues increased from million in to million in in june  we began direct distribution of our product in europe  which has contributed to our increase in sales 
the operations of our newly acquired subsidiary  electric  are included in our operating results since january   which also contributed to our increase in revenues 
the recent global macroeconomic environment has continued to put significant pressure on discretionary consumer spending worldwide 
while we believe volcom is well positioned from a business and financial perspective  we are not immune to global economic conditions 
we believe it is these conditions that caused our revenues to decrease million to million in from million in based upon our experience and consumer reaction to our products and brand image  we believe that the increase in our revenues from to resulted primarily from increased brand recognition and growing acceptance of our products at existing retail accounts 
we believe that our marketing programs  product designs and product quality  and our relationships with our retailers contributed to this increased demand and market penetration 
in addition  several of our largest retailers have opened additional stores and those store openings likely have contributed to an increase in our product revenues  however  period over period increases in our product revenues as judged solely by additional store openings by our largest retailers may not be a useful or accurate measure of revenue increases because our products may not be carried in every new store 
growth of our revenues will depend in part on the demand for our products by consumers  our ability to effectively distribute our products and our ability to design products consistent with the changing fashion interests of boardsports participants and those who affiliate themselves with the broader action sports youth lifestyle 
sales to pacific sunwear decreased  or million  for compared to we currently expect a decrease in revenue from pacific sunwear in the first quarter of compared to first quarter of pacific sunwear remains an important customer for us and we are working both internally and with pacific sunwear to maximize our business with them 
we believe our brand continues to be an important part of the pacific sunwear business 
we also recognize that any customer concentration creates risks and we are  therefore  assessing strategies to lessen our concentration with pacific sunwear 
our gross margins are affected by our ability to accurately forecast demand and avoid excess inventory by matching purchases of finished goods to preseason orders  which decreases our percentage of sales at discount or close out prices 
gross margins are also impacted by our ability to control our sourcing costs and  to a lesser extent  by changes in our product mix and geographic distribution channel 
if the current global economic environment persists or worsens in  we may determine it to be necessary to offer additional discounts  which may reduce our gross margins and could adversely impact our financial performance and results of operations 
our gross margins have also historically been seasonal  with the first quarter typically having the highest margin 
if we misjudge forecasting inventory levels or our sourcing costs increase and we are unable to raise our prices  our gross margins may decline 
we currently source the majority of our products from third party manufacturers located primarily in china and mexico 
as a result  we may be adversely affected by the disruption of trade with these countries  the imposition of new regulations related to imports  duties  taxes and other charges on imports  and significant decreases in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
we seek to mitigate the possible disruption in product flow by diversifying our manufacturing across numerous manufacturers and by using manufacturers in countries that we believe to be politically stable 
we do not enter into long term contracts with our third party manufacturers 
rather  we typically enter into contracts with each manufacturer to produce one or more product line for a particular selling season 
this strategy has enabled us to maintain flexibility in our sourcing 
our products manufactured abroad are subject to us customs laws  which impose tariffs as well as import quota restrictions for textiles and apparel 
quota represents the right  pursuant to bilateral or other international trade arrangements  to export amounts of certain categories of merchandise into a country or territory pursuant to 
table of contents a visa or license 
additionally  china offers a rebate tax on exports to control the amount of exports from china  which can affect our cost either positively or negatively 
these potential cost increases  along with the rising currency and labor shortages in china  may have an impact on our business 
while we do not believe the limitations on imports from china will have a material effect on our operations  there may be increased pressure on costs and we intend to closely monitor our sourcing in china to avoid disruptions 
with the passage of the consumer product safety improvement act of and similar state laws  such as california s proposition  there are new requirements mandated for the textiles and apparel industries 
these requirements relate to all metal and painted trim items and certain other raw materials used in children s apparel  as well as flammability standards in certain types of textiles 
the consumer product safety commission  or cpsc  will require certification and testing for lead in paint and metal trims  pointed or sharp edge items  phthalates  and fabric flammability to meet the cpsc s limits 
we will continue to monitor the situation and intend to abide by all rules and changes made by the cpsc and similar state laws 
this could have a negative impact on the cost of our goods and poses a potential risk if we do not adhere to these requirements 
over the past five years  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased on an absolute dollar basis as we have increased our spending on marketing  advertising and promotions  strengthened our management team  hired additional personnel and made investments in new territories and initiatives 
as a percentage of revenues  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased from in to in this increase was primarily due to additional expenses in the united states segment associated with growth and brand building initiatives  including costs associated with our transition to a new warehouse facility in irvine  california 
in addition  we have made investments in our recently acquired distributors in japan and the uk  which has increased our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues 
our selling  general and administrative expenses have decreased on an absolute dollar basis from million in to million in this decrease in absolute dollars was due primarily to our company wide expense reduction initiatives enacted in  and decreases in commissions expense and amortization expense 
however  our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased from in to in this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to the deleveraging of certain fixed costs over a lower revenue base as well as incremental expenses associated with our recently acquired distributors in japan and the uk  and incremental expenses associated with our additional retail stores 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these consolidated financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized upon shipment  at which time transfer of title occurs and risk of ownership passes to the customer 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provides for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brand and our image 
we record an allowance for anticipated returns through a reduction in revenues in the period that the related revenues are recorded 
sales returns allowances are estimated based upon historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demands and sell through of products 
historically  our actual sales returns have not been materially different from management s original estimates 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate 
table of contents the allowance for sales returns 
however  if the actual sales returns are significantly different than the recorded estimated allowance  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
for example  assuming there had been a increase in our returns  pre tax income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
licensing revenues are recorded when earned based on a stated percentage of the licensees sales of volcom branded products 
accounts receivable we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
our payment terms are typically net with terms up to net for certain products 
throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience of bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition  current economic trends and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified  all of which are subject to change 
historically  our losses associated with uncollectible accounts have been consistent with our estimates  but we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  our operating results would be adversely affected 
assuming there had been a increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts  pre tax income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by approximately million 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reported as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses when they arise 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of the cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following weak economic conditions  changes in consumer preferences  buying patterns of our retailers  retailers cancelling orders  and unseasonable weather 
some events  including terrorist acts or threats and trade restrictions and safeguards  could also interrupt the production and importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and market value could be inaccurate  which could result in excess or obsolete inventory 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
assuming there had been a increase in our allowance for excess or obsolete inventory  our pre tax income for the year ended december  would have been reduced by million 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill based on a 
table of contents two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and we may be required to recognize an impairment loss in the future 
any impairment losses are reflected in operating income 
in  we recorded an impairment loss associated with the non amortizing intangible assets related to volcom europe 
in  we recorded an impairment loss associated with the goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets related to the acquisitions of electric and laguna surf sport 
in  we recorded an impairment loss associated with the goodwill related to its subsidiary  welcom distribution sarl 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
long lived assets we acquire assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets and other amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments  if any  would be recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 
in and  we recorded impairment losses associated with its amortizing intangible assets related to the acquisitions of electric and laguna surf sport 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
investment in unconsolidated investee we account for our investments in unconsolidated investees using the cost method if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
we assess such investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
if  and when  an event or change in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment is identified  we estimate the fair value of the investment and  if the reduction in value is determined to be other than temporary  we record an impairment loss on the investment 
income taxes we adopted the provisions of guidance included in asc on january  the guidance included in asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
as a result of the implementation of guidance included in asc  we recognized a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we record a provision and liability for federal  state and foreign income taxes using an annual effective tax rate 
deferred income taxes are recorded at our effective tax rate 
management s judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more 
table of contents likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets that had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc we account for all stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our expected option term and stock price volatility assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
foreign currency translation we own international subsidiaries that operate with the local currency as their functional currency 
our international subsidiaries generate revenues and collect receivables at future dates in the customers local currencies  and purchase inventory primarily in us dollars 
accordingly  we are exposed to gains and losses that result from the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on foreign currency denominated transactions 
during and  we entered into forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our european operations us dollar denominated inventory purchases 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives in other comprehensive income 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
a portion of our domestic sales are made in canadian dollars 
in addition  our recently acquired electric subsidiary purchases sunglass inventory in euros 
as a result  our domestic operations are exposed to transaction gains and losses that result from movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date  and are reflected in our statement of operations 
general our revenues consist of both our product revenues and our licensing revenues 
our product revenues are derived primarily from the sale of young mens and young womens clothing  accessories and related products under the volcom brand name

operating expenses in  consolidated total operating expenses decreased million  or  to million compared to million in in  operating expenses included a million non cash asset impairment charge on goodwill and intangible assets related to the acquisitions of electric and laguna surf sport 
these impairment charges were driven by the economic downturn  whereby our estimated future cash flows expected from these reporting units were significantly reduced causing decreases in their estimated fair market values 
the remaining million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due primarily to decreased commissions expense of million associated with a decrease in revenues between periods  decreased amortization expense of million associated with the impairment of amortizing intangible assets during the fourth quarter of and a net decrease in various other expense categories of million

further  several of our largest retailers opened additional stores during and those store openings likely contributed to an increase in our product revenues  however  period over period increases in our product revenues as judged solely by additional store openings by our largest retailers may not be a useful or accurate measure of revenue increases because our products may not be carried in every new store

seasonality historically  we have experienced greater revenue in the second half of the year than in the first half due to a concentration of shopping around the fall and holiday seasons and pricing differences between our products sold during the first and second half of the year  as products we sell in the fall and holiday seasons generally have higher prices per unit than products we sell in the spring and summer seasons 
we typically sell more of our summer products boardshorts  t shirts and sunglasses in the first half of the year and a majority of our winter products pants  long sleeve shirts  sweaters  fleece  jackets  outerwear and goggles in the second half of the year 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our revenues is likely to continue 
in addition  our direct european operations began shipping product during the second half of which caused a slightly higher concentration of revenues in the second half of over historical levels 
our business in europe is extremely seasonal with revenues concentrated primarily in the first and third quarters  shipment of low margin samples concentrated in the second and fourth quarters  and a relatively steady pace of selling  general and administrative expenses throughout the year 
during the two year period ended december   approximately of our revenues  of our gross profit and of our operating income excluding non cash asset impairment charges were generated in the second half of the year  with the third quarter generally generating most of our operating income due to fall  holiday and snow shipments 
accordingly  our results of operations for the first and second quarters of any year are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
as a result of the effects of seasonality  particularly in preparation for the fall and holiday shopping seasons  our inventory levels and other working capital requirements generally begin to increase during the second quarter and into the third quarter of each year 
based on our current cash and short term investment position  we do not anticipate borrowing under our credit facility in the near term 
backlog we typically receive the bulk of our orders for each of our seasons up to four months prior to the date the products are shipped to customers 
generally  these orders are not subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment 
at december   our order backlog was approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  for a variety of reasons  including the timing of release dates for our seasonal product collections  the timing of shipments  timing of order deadlines  timing of receipt of orders  product mix of customer orders and the amount of in season orders  backlog may not be a reliable measure of future sales for any succeeding period 
for these reasons  backlog figures in one year may not be directly comparable to backlog figures in another year when measured at the same date 
inflation we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations in the past 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
vulnerability due to concentrations one customer  pacific sunwear  accounted for approximately and of our product revenues in and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our product revenues in or sales to pacific sunwear decreased  or million  for compared to we currently expect a decrease in revenue from pacific sunwear in the first quarter of compared to first quarter of pacific 
table of contents sunwear remains an important customer for us and we are working both internally and with pacific sunwear to maximize our business with them 
we believe our brand continues to be an important part of the pacific sunwear business 
we also recognize that any customer concentration creates risks and we are  therefore  assessing strategies to lessen our concentration with pacific sunwear 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and source our products from independently owned manufacturers 
purchases from dragon crowd and ningbo jehson textiles totaled approximately and  respectively  of our product costs in  and and  respectively  of our product costs in recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks see note to the consolidated financial statements that could impact our results of operations 
we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  licensing revenues and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
changes in foreign currency rates affect our results of operations and distort comparisons between periods 
for example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results from our european operation because it takes more profits in euro to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge the translation of operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
a portion of our domestic sales are made in canadian dollars 
in  and  we derived  and of our product revenues  respectively  from sales in canada 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in the value of canadian dollar denominated receivables and payables  foreign currency investments  primarily consisting of canadian dollar deposits  and cash flows related to repatriation of those investments 
a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could negatively impact the profitability of our products sold in canada and the value of our canadian receivables  as well as the value of repatriated funds we may bring back to the united states from canada 
account balances denominated in canadian dollars are marked to market every period using current exchange rates and the resulting changes in the account balance are included in our income statement as other income 
if recent foreign currency market volatility continues and the canadian dollar weakens  our results could be adversely affected 
based on the balance of canadian dollar receivables of approximately million at december   an assumed strengthening of the us dollar would result in pretax foreign currency losses of million 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks between the euro and the us dollar  as a portion of our european operations purchases inventory in us dollars 
this exposure is partially offset as a portion of our domestic electric operations purchases inventory in euro 
in addition  we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from various other european operations transactions that are denominated in us dollars 
a weakening of the euro relative to the us dollar could have a negative impact on our net exposure of the euro to the us dollar 
if recent foreign currency market volatility continues and the euro weakens compared to the us dollar  our results could be adversely affected 
based on our net euro exposure of approximately million  an assumed strengthening of the us dollar would result in pre tax foreign currency losses of million 
we generally purchase volcom branded finished goods from our manufacturers in us dollars 
however  we source substantially all of these finished goods abroad and their cost may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our costs 
if we are unable to increase our prices to a level sufficient to cover the increased costs  it could adversely affect our margins and we may become less price competitive with companies who manufacture their products in the united states 
interest rate risk we maintain a million unsecured credit agreement which includes a line of credit  foreign exchange facility and letter of credit sub facilities with no balance outstanding at december  the credit agreement  which expires on august   may be used to fund our working capital requirements 
borrowings under this 
table of contents agreement bear interest  at our option  either at the bank s prime rate at december  or libor plus 
based on the average interest rate on our credit facility during  and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding  we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition
