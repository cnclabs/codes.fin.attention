if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our earnings could decrease 
in the event that our loan customers do not repay their loans according to the terms of the loans  and the collateral securing the repayment of these loans is insufficient  or a ready market is not available  to cover any remaining loan balance  we could experience significant loan losses  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets  if any  serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans 
in determining the amount of our allowance for loan losses  we rely on our loan quality reviews  our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions  among other factors 
if our assumptions are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio  which may require additions to our allowance 
although we are unaware of any specific problems with our loan portfolio that would require any increase in our allowance at the present time  our allowance for loan losses may need to be increased further in the future due to our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of commercial business and commercial real estate loans 
any material additions to our allowance for loan losses would materially decrease our net income 
in addition  our regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
our concentrations in construction loans  including speculative construction loans  nonresidential real estate loans and land loans may expose us to increased credit risk 
speculative construction loans are loans made to builders who have not identified a buyer for the completed property at the time of loan origination 
although our origination of these types of loans has slowed as the local economy has slowed  over time  we intend to continue to emphasize the origination of these loan types 
these loan types expose a lender to greater risk of non payment and loss than one to four family mortgage loans because the repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operation or sale of the property and the income stream of the borrowers and such loans typically involve larger balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers 
in addition  many borrowers of these types of loans have more than one loan outstanding with us so an adverse development with respect to one loan or credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of non payment and loss 
furthermore  we may need to increase our allowance for loan losses through future charges to income as the portfolio of these types of loans grows  which would hurt our earnings 
for more information about the credit risk we face  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management 
noncore funding represents a large component of our funding base 
in addition to the traditional core deposits  such as demand deposit accounts  interest checking  money market savings and certificates of deposits  we utilize several noncore funding sources  such as federal home loan bank of cincinnati advances  the federal reserve discount window  federal funds purchased and other sources 
we utilize these noncore funding sources to fund our ongoing operations and growth 
the availability of these noncore funding sources are subject to broad economic conditions and  as such  the pricing on these sources may fluctuate significantly and or be restricted at any point in time  thus impacting our net interest income  our immediate liquidity and or our access to additional liquidity 
should the fhlb system deteriorate to the point of not being able to fund future advances to banks  including first federal  this would place increased pressure on other wholesale funding sources 
fluctuations in interest rates may hurt our earnings and asset value 
the company s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
special federal deposit insurance corporation assessments and increased base assessment rates by the federal deposit insurance corporation will decrease our earnings 
beginning in late  the economic environment caused higher levels of bank failures  which dramatically increased federal deposit insurance corporation resolution costs and led to a significant reduction in the deposit insurance fund 
as a result  the federal deposit insurance corporation has significantly increased the initial base assessment rates paid by financial institutions for deposit insurance 
the base assessment rate was increased by seven basis points cents for every of deposits for the first quarter of effective april   initial base assessment rates were changed to range from basis points to basis points across all risk categories with possible adjustments to these rates based on certain debt related components 
these increases in the base assessment rate will increase our deposit insurance costs and negatively impact our earnings 
in addition  in may  the federal deposit insurance corporation imposed a special assessment on all insured institutions due to recent bank and savings association failures 
the emergency assessment amounts to basis points on each institution s assets minus tier capital as of june   subject to a maximum equal to basis points times the institution s assessment base 
the assessment was collected on september  based on our assets and tier capital as of june   our special assessment was approximately  the special assessment decreased our earnings 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation may impose additional emergency special assessments after june   of up to basis points per quarter on each institution s assets minus tier capital if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance or as a result of deterioration in the deposit insurance fund reserve ratio due to institution failures 
any additional emergency special assessment imposed by the federal deposit insurance corporation will further decrease our earnings 
we could be subject to valuation and extension risk related to the federal reserve ending its program to purchase mortgage backed securities backed by fannie mae  freddie mac and ginnie mae 
on november   the federal reserve announced that it would initiate a program to purchase billion in direct obligations of fannie mae  freddie mac and the federal home loan banks and billion in mortgage backed securities backed by fannie mae  freddie mac and the government national mortgage association ginnie mae 
the federal reserve stated that its actions were intended to reduce the cost and increase the availability of credit for the purchase of houses  which in turn should support housing markets and foster improved conditions in financial markets more generally 
on march   the federal open market committee fomc announced the expansion of the federal reserve s program to purchase up to trillion of mortgage backed securities 
on september   the fomc announced that the federal reserve would gradually slow the pace of purchases  anticipating that they would be complete by the end of first quarter recent fomc pronouncements have confirmed that intention 
the planned withdrawal of the federal reserve from the market for mortgage backed investments could cause mortgage rates to rise and the price of mortgage backed securities to fall  which would negatively impact the valuation of our investments in mortgage backed securities and increase extension risk on those investments 
valuation risk is the risk that prices for mortgage backed investments could decline as mortgage rates increase 
extension risk is the cash flow risk resulting from the possibility that fewer borrowers will prepay or refinance their loans as interest rates in the mortgage market increase 
this could result in lowering the bank s capital due to declines in mark to market valuations and our net interest margin could be negatively impacted by holding relatively lower yielding investments for a longer than anticipated period 
our balance sheet leverage transactions are subject to reinvestment and interest rate risks 
on april  we entered into two balance sheet leverage transactions  utilizing structured repurchase agreements  which totaled million 
million of the borrowings have call options ranging from two to three years after origination  with final maturities ranging from five to ten years if they are not called 
collateral for the borrowings consists of u 
s 
agency pass through mortgage backed securities the securities 
borrowing rates as of the report date are substantially lower than when the leverage transaction was originated 
if borrowing rates remain at or near current low levels for two to three years it is possible that the structured repurchase agreement borrowings will not be called and the bank will be paying above market rates for borrowings for an extended period of time 
additionally  the recent decrease in mortgage rates has increased the amount of mortgages being refinanced 
prepayment of the mortgages that are collateral for the securities used in the structured repurchase agreement could require us to substitute additional collateral if the minimum collateral level is not maintained 
the bank may not have suitable collateral in the portfolio to substitute at the time and would have to purchase additional securities at market prices 
additional purchases would likely be reinvested in much lower yielding investments 
both factors discussed here could contribute to a mismatch in terms of the effective duration of both the borrowings and the securities and would negatively impact the anticipated spread on the leverage transaction 
we may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  the company s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to the company 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 
from time to time  the company may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts  particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed 
in developing and marketing new lines of business and or new products and services the company may invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of the company s system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
a downturn in the local economy or a decline in real estate values could hurt our profits 
a large majority of our loans are secured by real estate in montgomery county  tennessee  and the surrounding areas 
as a result of this concentration  a downturn in the local economy could significantly increase nonperforming loans  which would hurt our profits 
historically  fort campbell  a nearby us army installation  has played a significant role in the economy of our primary market area 
future deployments would dampen economic activity 
furthermore  a decline in real estate values could lead to some of our mortgage loans becoming inadequately collateralized  which would expose us to greater risk of loss 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could hurt our portfolio of construction loans  nonresidential real estate loans  and land loans and could reduce our ability to originate such loans 
for a discussion of our primary market area  see item  business market area 
strong competition within our primary market area could hurt our profits and slow growth 
we face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits 
this competition has made it more difficult for us to make new loans and attract deposits 
price competition for loans and deposits might result in us earning less on our loans and paying more on our deposits  which would reduce net interest income 
competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits 
some of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide 
we expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry 
our profitability depends upon our continued ability to compete successfully in our primary market area 
see item  business market area and business competition for more information about our primary market area and the competition we face 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the office of thrift supervision  first federal s chartering authority  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation  as insurer of our deposits 
regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the imposition of restrictions on our operations  the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  regulations  legislation or supervisory action  may have a material impact on our operations 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in the company s customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of its information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of the company s information systems could damage the company s reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose the company to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounters technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in the company s operations 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
the company may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  the company s financial condition and results of operations 
our operations rely on certain external vendors 
the company is reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day to day operations of the company 
accordingly  the company s operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements 
the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements could be disruptive to the company s operations  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  the company s financial condition and results of operations 
even though our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq stock market s global market  it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange 
the trading volume in our common stock on the nasdaq global market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the nasdaq global market or other stock exchanges 
because of this  it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of our common stock in the market  or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market  will have on the market price of our common stock 
we can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market  or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market  would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past  and may fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance 
general market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock  and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices 
we may not continue to pay dividends on our common stock in the future 
holders of first advantage bancorp common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as its board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments 
although first advantage has established a pattern of declaring quarterly cash dividends on its common stock  it is not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate its common stock dividend in the future 
this could adversely affect the market price of first advantage bancorp s common stock 
also  first advantage bancorp is a bank holding company  and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations 
an investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit 
the company s common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in the company s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire the company s common stock  you could lose some or all of your investment 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties and material misrepresentations could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  the company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
the company may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  the company s financial condition and results of operations 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations

overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors affecting the company s financial condition as of december  and and results of operations for each of the years in the two year period ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands  except per share amounts 
income 
our primary source of pre tax income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
other significant sources of pre tax income are service charges mostly from service charges on deposit accounts and loan servicing fees  fees from sale of mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market  and commissions on sales of securities and insurance products 
we also recognize income and loss from the sale of securities 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
expenses 
the non interest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits expenses  occupancy expenses  federal deposit insurance premiums  data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
our non interest expenses are likely to increase as a result of operating as a public company 
these additional expenses consist primarily of legal and accounting fees  expenses of shareholder communications and meetings  stock exchange listing fees  and expenses related to the addition of personnel in our accounting department 
salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes  and expenses for health insurance  retirement plans and other employee benefits 
we recognize additional annual employee compensation expenses related to the equity incentive plan which was approved by shareholders and adopted in occupancy expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment  consist primarily of depreciation charges  furniture and equipment expenses  maintenance  real estate taxes and costs of utilities 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using the straight line method based on the useful lives of the related assets  which range from three to years 
data processing expenses are the fees we pay to third parties for processing customer information  deposits and loans 
federal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the federal deposit insurance corporation for insurance of our deposit accounts 
other expenses include expenses for professional services  advertising  office supplies  postage  telephone  insurance  regulatory assessments and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies followed by the company conform  in all material respects  to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and to general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
while the company bases estimates on historical experience  current information and other factors deemed to be relevant  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impacted loans  value of collateral  and determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision  as an integral part of its examination process  periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would adversely affect earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
other than temporary impairment 
management periodically evaluates the company s investment securities portfolio for other than temporary impairment 
if a security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired  the related unrealized loss is charged to earnings  and a new cost basis is established 
factors considered include the reasons for the impairment  the severity and duration of the impairment  changes in value subsequent to period end  and forecasted performance of the security issuer 
impairment is considered other than temporary unless the company has both the intent and ability to hold the security until the fair value recovers and evidence supporting the recovery outweighs evidence to the contrary 
however  for equity securities  which typically do not have a contractual maturity with a specified cash flow on which to rely  the ability to hold an equity security indefinitely  by itself  does not allow for avoidance of other than temporary impairment 
future changes in management s assessment of other than temporary impairment on its securities could result in significant charges to earnings in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
operating strategy under the leadership of our current senior management team  the majority of which was assembled in  our long term focus is to operate and grow a profitable community oriented financial institution 
we plan to achieve this objective by pursuing a strategy of improving our policies and procedures and internal control and information systems  utilizing what we believe are conservative underwriting practices to pursue nonresidential real estate and commercial business lending opportunities with a focus on small businesses and construction lending opportunities in our primary market area  including speculative construction lending opportunities  continuing to emphasize consumer retail banking by offering a broad array of loan and deposit products  maintaining a stable core deposit base and providing remarkable customer service to attract and retain customers  and expanding our market share by opening new branch offices and pursuing opportunities to acquire other financial institutions  although we currently have no definitive plans regarding potential acquisition opportunities 
improving our policies and procedures and internal control and information systems we continue to improve our policies and procedures and will make further improvements to internal controls in order to maintain compliance with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of in december of our board of directors adopted a new loan policy  effective january   which we believe will supply the proper structure for the bank s increased emphasis on small business  non residential real estate and commercial lending and also support the bank s future growth 
utilizing what we believe are conservative underwriting practices to pursue in our primary market area nonresidential real estate and commercial business lending opportunities with a focus on small businesses and construction lending  including speculative construction lending opportunities 
we believe that high asset quality is a key to long term financial success 
under the leadership of our management team  we believe we have implemented conservative loan underwriting standards 
we intend to continue to pursue construction lending and nonresidential real estate and commercial business lending opportunities in our primary market area in accordance with those underwriting standards

more specifically  in september  the company recorded otti charges of million for investment grade perpetual callable preferred securities issued by federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac and federal national mortgage association fannie mae  and it recorded impairment charges of million for its investments in pooled trust preferred securities 
the company also recorded million in losses from the sale of fannie mae perpetual preferred stock during the third quarter of the company liquidated all of its remaining fannie mae and freddie mac perpetual preferred securities holdings during the fourth quarter of which resulted in additional realized losses of  these realized losses were partially offset by gains on the sale of available for sale securities of  which were realized during the fourth quarter of the otti charges which negatively affected non interest income results for the year ended december  were partially offset by a increase in net gains on loan sales into the secondary mortgage market compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributed to higher volume in refinancing of existing homes and customers taking advantage of the u 
s 
government s tax credit incentives for first time home buyers 
loan servicing and others fees increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended primarily due to our increased loan volume 
customer service and other fees increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in deposit holders at the bank 
the net gain on sales of other assets held for sale during was primarily related to the march   sale of the bank s former headquarters 
commissions on insurance and brokerage declined for the year ended december  from the year ended december  as a result of continued overall market turmoil

the addition of a new branch facility and higher property tax and maintenance costs contributed to an increase of  or in occupancy expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  data processing fees  office expense and equipment expense increased a total of  or primarily due to expanded service offerings  increased volumes related to customer growth and higher depreciation 
total salaries and employee benefits increased  or for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   mainly due to the recognition of a full year of expense related to the stock awards for directors and employees under the company s equity incentive plan  which was only in place for approximately five months during professional fees declined  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period of primarily due to decreased audit and consulting fees 
provision credit for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was  for the year ended december  compared to a credit for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate for was compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate reflects an increase in the relative impact of tax exempt income on the overall tax rate and the positive impact of reversing  of tax reserves during risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk and market risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or investment when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities  that are accounted for on a mark to market basis 
other risks that we face are operational risks  liquidity risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  we take a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
when the loan becomes days past due  a late notice is sent to the borrower 
when the loan becomes days past due  a more formal letter is sent 
between and days past due  telephone calls are also made to the borrower 
after days  we regard the borrower as in default 
at days delinquent  the borrower may be sent a letter from our attorney and we may commence collection proceedings 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan is sold at foreclosure 
when a consumer loan becomes days past due  we institute collection proceedings and attempt to repossess any personal property that secures the loan 
management informs the board of directors monthly of the amount of loans delinquent more than days  all loans in foreclosure and repossessed property that we own 
nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider repossessed assets and loans that are typically days or more past due to be nonperforming assets 
typically  loans are placed on nonaccrual status when they become days delinquent at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the allowance for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are first applied to the outstanding principal balance 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
when property is acquired it is recorded at fair market value at the date of foreclosure 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is charged against interest income 
subsequent interest payments are applied to the outstanding principal balance 
the following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated 
we had no troubled debt restructurings at any of the dates indicated and we had no impaired loans at december  at december  dollars in thousands nonaccrual loans one to four family multifamily and nonresidential construction land consumer commercial total accruing loans past due days or more one to four family multi family and nonresidential construction land consumer commercial total total of nonaccrual and days or more past due loans real estate owned other nonperforming assets total nonperforming assets total nonperforming loans to total loans total nonperforming loans to total assets total nonperforming assets to total assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and foreclosed assets 
non performing assets totaled million at december  compared to  at december  the increase was primarily in the one to four family residential mortgage and multi family loan portfolios 
federal regulations require us to review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the office of thrift supervision has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as substandard or doubtful we may establish a specific allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as loss  we charge off an amount equal to of the portion of the asset classified loss 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated 
at december  dollars in thousands special mention assets substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets there was a increase in the level of classified assets from december  to december  primarily in our one to four family residential and multi family loan portfolios 
classified assets increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  these classified assets are primarily loans rated special mention or substandard in accordance with regulatory guidance 
these assets warrant and receive increased management oversight and loan loss reserves have been established to account for the increased credit risk of these assets 
classified assets include loans that are classified due to factors other than payment delinquencies  such as lack of current financial statements and other required documentation  insufficient cash flows or other deficiencies  and  therefore  are not included as non performing assets 
other than as disclosed in the above tables  there are no other loans where management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and represents management s best estimate of known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based upon management s evaluation of the portfolio s collectibility 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
the recommendations for increases or decreases to the allowance are approved by the asset quality review committee and presented to the board of directors 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of a specific allowance on identified problem loans  and a general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
management estimates a range of losses and then makes its best estimate of potential credit losses within that range 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
specific allowance required for identified problem loans 
we establish an allowance on certain identified problem loans based on such factors as the strength of the customer s personal or business cash flows  the availability of other sources of repayment  the amount due or past due  the type and value of collateral  the strength of our collateral position  and the borrower s effort to cure the delinquency 
general valuation allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
we establish a general allowance for loans that are not currently classified in order to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities 
this general valuation allowance is determined through two steps 
first  we estimate potential losses on the portfolio by analyzing historical losses for each loan category 
second  we look at additional significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures  international  national  regional and local economic conditions  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management  changes in the volume of past dues  non accruals and classified assets  changes in the quality of the loan review system  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  concentrations of credit  and other factors 
we also identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all delinquent loans  classified loans and other loans for which management may have concerns about collectibility 
for individually reviewed loans  the borrower s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan or a shortfall in collateral value would result in our allocating a portion of the allowance to the loan that was impaired 
at december   our allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans 
at december   our allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased  to million at december  from million at december  primarily due an increase loan growth of approximately during the year ended december  and  to a lesser extent  the increase in nonperforming and classified loans and weakened general economic conditions

furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that the office of thrift supervision  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not require us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
the office of thrift supervision may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

the dividend payout is continually reviewed by management and the board of directors 
the company s board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program 
in general  stock repurchase plans allow the company to proactively manage its capital position and return excess capital to shareholders 
shares purchased under such plans also provide the company with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards 
under the stock repurchase program  which was approved on december   the company was authorized to repurchase up to  shares  or of its common stock  from time to time in the open market or through private transactions 
under the plan  the company repurchased  shares at a total cost of  during the year ended december  also see part ii  item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  included elsewhere in this report 
liquidity 
liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure  its ability to liquidate assets  and its access to alternative sources of funds 
the company seeks to ensure its funding needs are met by maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management 
asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits in banks  securities available for sale  maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity  and federal funds sold and resell agreements 
first federal relies on deposits as its principal source of funds and  therefore  must be in a position to service depositors needs as they arise 
fluctuations in the balances of a few large depositors may cause temporary increases and decreases in liquidity from time to time 
we deal with such fluctuations by using existing liquidity sources 
concerns over deposit fluctuations with respect to the overall banking industry were addressed by the fdic in september and october the fdic temporarily increased the individual account deposit insurance from  per account to  per account through december   which has subsequently been extended through december  the fdic also implemented a temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which provides for full fdic coverage for transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amounts 
first federal elected to opt in to this program  thus  our customers receive full coverage for transaction accounts under the program 
the tlgp was originally set to expire december   but the fdic has extended the program through june  first federal elected to continue participation in this program 
as of december   concerns regarding the overall banking industry or the company could have an adverse effect on future deposit levels 
liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  federal reserve bank  repurchase agreements and federal funds purchased 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management policy 
the company is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  the company  on a stand alone basis  is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its shareholders 
the company also has repurchased shares of its common stock 
the amount of dividends that the bank may declare and pay to the company in any calendar year  without the receipt of prior approval from the office of thrift supervision but with prior notice to the office of thrift supervision  cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income as defined for the preceding two calendar years 
on a stand alone basis  the company had liquid assets of approximately million at december  off balance sheet arrangements  commitments and contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
for the year ended december   we did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
commitments 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  million in unused commercial lines of credit including unadvanced portions of construction loans and million in unused open end consumer lines of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of certificates of deposit 
we believe the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods due to the recent low interest rate environment and local competitive pressure 
if these maturing deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before december  we believe  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
contractual obligations 
the following table presents certain of our contractual obligations as of december  over year years years years total dollars in thousands deposits without stated maturity certificates of deposit operating leases long term debt federal home loan bank long term debt other banks purchase obligations total contractual obligations regulatory capital management 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the office of thrift supervision  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december  and  we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines

effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this annual report have been prepared according to accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management the bank manages the interest rate sensitivity of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of earnings  the bank has sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
the bank s strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes adjusting the maturities of borrowings  adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration and selling in the secondary market substantially all newly originated one to four family residential real estate loans 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
the bank has an asset liability committee which includes members of management approved by the board of directors  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
the goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and net income 
net portfolio value analysis the bank uses a net portfolio value analysis prepared by the office of thrift supervision to review the level of the bank s interest rate risk 
this analysis measures interest rate risk by capturing changes in the net portfolio value of the bank s cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items  based on a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
net portfolio value represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the market value of assets minus the market value of liabilities  with adjustments made for off balance sheet items 
these analyses assess risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or and basis point decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that the bank might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
the following table  which is based on information that the bank provided to the office of thrift supervision  presents the change in the bank s net portfolio value at december  that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates based on office of thrift supervision assumptions  with no effect given to any steps the bank might take to counteract that change

these assumptions relate to interest rates  loan repayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analyses presented in the foregoing tables 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis over the life of the asset 
further  if there is a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from certificates could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on interest income 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities held by the bank  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of the bank s earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
the bank s asset sensitivity would be reduced if repayments slow and vice versa 
while we believe these assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity
