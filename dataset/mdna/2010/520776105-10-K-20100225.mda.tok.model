item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview during  the global economic recession and contraction in the credit markets continued to negatively affect customer demand throughout our industry 
sales declined by during compared to the recession forced many of our customers to reduce their inventories  suspend purchases of industrial supplies and downgrade the quality of product purchased due to the overall deterioration of the economy 
additionally  the contraction in the credit market has made it difficult for many of our customers to finance purchases or expand their businesses 
in addition  we continued to be impacted by the lingering effects of the dpa settlement see item legal proceedings including the loss of several sales agents  as competitors used the dpa as a recruiting tool to entice agents away from us 
in we reviewed our strategic and growth alternatives with a focus on our ability to meet customer demands in the current competitive environment 
as a result  we developed a comprehensive strategic plan focused on increasing the value of the organization 
starting in  we began transforming our current platform and infrastructure by executing on the following three initiatives re structuring our sales organization  optimizing our distribution network and replacing our legacy information systems with a best in class erp system 
we dedicated a significant number of internal resources and made investments in these initiatives as we believe they will position us to better serve our existing customers and grow the organization in the future 
although we believe this is the right long term strategy  these focused efforts along with the global economic recession impacted our ability to drive more positive results in significant progress has been made on the above initiatives 
we are taking action to improve our current sales agent model while retaining its advantages 
this includes converting district managers into full time employees who will be able to concentrate their efforts on managing their territory and increasing sales productivity 
during  we closed two distribution centers to better align our supply chain with our customer base and eliminate redundancies within our distribution network 
additionally  we have performed a comprehensive review of our existing information systems and have selected a new erp solution that will be implemented during and these initiatives  which are described in item business  will require a significant amount of additional effort and investment over the next two years  but should lead to a much more efficient  responsive and profitable organization in the future 
in response to the recession and our declining sales  we took a number of steps to realign our cost structure with the new economic reality 
in we reduced our workforce by over  temporarily suspended annual compensation increases  curtailed or delayed spending on certain services and supplies and reduced expenditures on capital equipment 
the closure of two of our distribution centers also resulted in significant cost savings 
our oem operations have been particularly hard hit during the current economic downturn 
operating margins that had been declining even before the recession  further deteriorated throughout as a result  the company has been concentrating on renegotiating contracts that provide an acceptable rate of return 
due to intense price competition  this has had a near term impact of reducing sales  as contracts with insufficient returns are not renewed 
we are actively investigating and evaluating a number of strategic options regarding these operations 
due to the significant declines in the operations of our oem and rutland business units and the uncertain probability of a quick recovery  we conducted an analysis of the value of their long lived assets 
based on this analysis  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million non cash impairment charge to write down the value of the assets to their estimated fair value 
in spite of the difficult economic environment of the past year and executing on our three initiatives  we generated million of cash from operations prior to disbursing million to comply with our obligation under the dpa settlement agreement 
the cash generated from operations and million of cash proceeds generated by the sale of our charlotte  north carolina distribution center allowed us to pay down our revolving line of credit by million and return million in dividend payments to our stockholders 
we were successful in our continuing efforts to reduce excess inventory  expedite collection of accounts receivable and manage cash outflows

oem gross profit decreased million in to million from million in gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to in from in the increase in the gross profit percentage is primarily attributable to more aggressive pricing of sales contracts and improved costs negotiated with our vendors

impairment of long lived assets due to the weakened economy and decreased forecasts of future operating results  we reviewed the recoverability of our long lived assets 
in performing the review for recoverability  we determined that the future expected undiscounted cash flows of our oem and rutland business units were less than the carrying amount of the assets 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million of which million related to property  plant and equipment and million related to other intangible assets  in order to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value

cash from operations was net of a million settlement payment in both and cash was generated in and primarily through the streamlining of our working capital by reducing excess inventories and expediting collection of accounts receivable 
working capital at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to a million reduction in inventory and an million reduction in accounts receivable  partially offset by decreases in other liabilities 
initiatives taken to improve the inventory management process led to the lower inventory balance  while increased attention to collections and a reduction in sales led to the decrease in the amount of outstanding accounts receivable 
cash used to purchase property  plant and equipment was million in compared to million in and million in which included million related to the reno  nevada facility expansion 
capital spending was reduced in in response to the economic downturn that began in the second half of however  we expect capital expenditures to significantly increase in due to anticipated expenditures on the implementation of a new erp system

financing activities included a million paydown of our line of credit in compared to the million paydown of the line of credit in the company paid dividends of million  million and million to stockholders of its common stock in  and  respectively 
in august  we entered into a new credit agreement with the privatebank and trust company credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides us with a total borrowing capacity of million in the form of a revolving line of credit and letters of credit and expires on august  additionally  we have a one time option  subject to the agent s consent  to increase the maximum borrowing capacity by an additional million  thus increasing the maximum borrowing capacity to million 
the credit agreement is secured by cash  accounts receivable and inventory 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving line of credit and million of outstanding letters of credit  leaving borrowing availability at million 

table of contents the interest rate under the credit agreement was initially set at either libor plus three percent or the prime rate through december  thereafter  the interest rate will be adjusted based on our debt to ebitda ratio 
the credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants  as defined in the credit agreement  including minimum ebitda  minimum tangible net worth levels  minimum cash plus accounts receivable and inventory to debt ratio and a minimum debt service coverage ratio 
the credit agreement also contains other customary representations  warranties  covenants and events of default and limits our annual dividend distribution to million 
also  in august  we terminated the first amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na dated as of november  and paid all related outstanding loans 
no prepayment penalties were incurred as part of the termination 
as a result of the termination  we recorded a million expense to write off the remaining deferred financing fees related to the terminated credit agreement 
in january  the company modified certain terms of the credit agreement 
the applicable interest rate margin of for libor loans and zero percent for prime loans was extended through june  thereafter  the applicable margins will be adjusted based on the company s debt to ebitda ratio to a range of for libor and minus for prime to for libor and zero percent for prime 
the minimum ebitda level  including a million add back in for the anticipated expense related to the implementation of an erp system  was set at million for the twelve month period ending december  and increases to million for the twelve month period ended march  and million for the twelve month periods ending june   september  and december   respectively 
the ratio of cash plus accounts receivable and inventory to outstanding debt was increased from to in  while the minimum tangible net worth level remained at million and the minimum debt service coverage ratio of commences with fiscal year ending december  on december  we were in compliance with all covenants as detailed below covenant requirement actual minimum ebitda  as defined in the amended credit agreement million million cash plus accounts receivable and inventory to debt ratio minimum tangible net worth million million we believe that cash provided by operations and the million revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements  strategic initiatives  dpa settlement payment and capital improvements for the upcoming fiscal year 
contractual obligations contractual obligations on december  that require payment over future periods are as follows dollars in thousands payments due in years ended december  total thereafter operating leases capital leases deferred compensation security bonus plan severance obligation long term incentive plan purchase commitments deferred prosecution agreement total contractual cash obligations payments to participants of the security bonus plan are made on a lump sum basis at time of separation from the company 
payouts for known separation dates have been included in the scheduled year of payout  while payouts for unknown separation dates are reflected in the thereafter column 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had future minimum operating lease commitments of million  principally for facilities and equipment 
we also had contractual commitments to purchase million of product from our suppliers in critical accounting policies we have disclosed our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following provides supplemental information to these accounting policies as well as information on the accounts requiring more significant estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs as a percent of accounts receivable outstanding 
if circumstances change eg  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be revised by a material amount 
at december   our allowance reserve was of our trade receivables outstanding 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance would have affected our annual doubtful accounts expense by approximately million 
inventory reserves inventories consist principally of finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
most of our products are not exposed to the risk of obsolescence due to technology changes 
however  some of our products do have a limited shelf life  and from time to time we add and remove items from our catalogs  brochures or website for marketing and other purposes 
in addition  we carry varying levels of customer specific inventory 
to reduce our inventory to a lower of cost or market value  we record a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical experience and monitoring current inventory activity 
we use estimates to determine the necessity of recording these reserves based on periodic detailed analysis reviews using both qualitative and quantitative factors 
as part of this analysis  we consider several factors including the inventories length of time on hand  historical sales  product shelf life  product life cycle  product classification  whether or not an item is in a catalog or website and product obsolescence 
in general  depending on product classification  we reserve inventory with low turnover at higher rates than inventory with high turnover 
our policy is to not re value inventory to the original cost basis subsequent to establishing a new cost basis 
at december   our inventory allowance reserve was million equal to approximately of our total inventory 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance would have affected our cost of goods sold by approximately million 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances  including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 

table of contents goodwill impairment goodwill  all of which is included in our lawson products business unit  is tested annually during the fourth quarter  or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
impairment of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
first the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired  and thus  the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
we estimate the fair value of the lawson products business unit using a market approach  which relies on the market value of companies that are engaged in the same line of business 
we also prepare a discounted cash flow dcf analysis based on the operating plan presented to our board of directors  to determine a range of fair values 
the dcf model relies on a number of assumptions that have a significant affect on the resulting fair value calculation and may change in future periods 
estimated future cash flows are affected both by future economic conditions outside the control of management and operating results directly related to management s execution of our business strategy 
our dcf model is also affected by our estimate of a discount rate that is consistent with the weighted average cost of capital that we anticipate a potential market participant would use 
we then assess the reasonableness of our estimate of the fair value of the lawson products business unit 
this is done by applying the same valuation methodology and estimates described above to the entire company and reconciling the resulting estimated fair value of the consolidated company to its market capitalization based on the trading range of the company s stock near the measurement date 
currently  the calculated fair value of the lawson business unit exceeds its carrying value by over million using our most conservative estimate and  therefore  is not considered impaired 
changes in the assumptions used in our dcf calculation could have a material affect on the fair value estimate and could change our assessment of impairment 
a hypothetical decrease in the estimated future annual cash flows generated by the lawson business unit would decrease its estimated fair value by million 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease its estimated fair value by million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk one of our subsidiaries is located and operates in canada using the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
operating results are translated into us dollars when consolidated into our financial statements 
therefore  we are exposed to market risk relating to the change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
a hypothetical change in the canadian foreign currency exchange rate would have affected our net sales by million and total assets by million 
a number of our current and past employees have opted to defer a portion of their earned compensation to be paid at a future date 
these individuals have the ability to invest the funds in one or more portfolios that track the performance of various mutual funds 
lawson has recorded a million liability equal to the market value amount of the funds owed as of december  additionally  we have invested funds in life insurance policies on certain executives 
the cash surrender value of the policies is invested in various investment instruments and the million market value of these investment instruments has been recorded as an asset on our financial statements as of december  the change in the market value of the funds supporting our deferred compensation plan and the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is recorded as a component of income and a hypothetical increase or decrease in the investment portfolios of both the cash value of life insurance asset and the deferred compensation liability would have affected our net loss by million 
we are exposed to market risk relating to increased commodity and energy costs affecting the production costs of our vendors 
these vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us and if we are unable to fully pass these costs through to our customers or to modify our activities  the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating profit margins 
on december   we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving line of credit 
however  in future years  operating results may be exposed to the market risk of fluctuations in the variable interest rate charged on our revolving line of credit
