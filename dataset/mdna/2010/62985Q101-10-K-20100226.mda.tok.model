use of non gaap financial measures direct contribution  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted effective tax rate  adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow are measures used by management to evaluate operating performance 
direct contribution is defined as net sales  less cost of product sold  selling and service expenses  marketing expenses  and research expenses 
ebitda is defined as net earnings attributable to nalco holding company plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for restructuring expenses and certain unusual items 
adjusted effective tax rate is defined as the income tax provision  excluding the tax expense benefit of specified transactions  divided by earnings loss before income taxes  excluding the earnings loss before income taxes attributable to those specified transactions 
adjusted earnings per share is defined as diluted net earnings per share attributable to nalco holding company common shareholders  adjusted for the per share impact of restructuring expenses  which fluctuate significantly from year to year  and other specified transactions that are unusual in nature 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures and net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 
direct contribution provides investors with the measurement used by our management to evaluate the performance of our segments 
we believe ebitda is useful to the investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
we believe adjusted ebitda  adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted earnings per share are useful for investors to fully understand our operating performance 
we believe free cash flow provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash for the optimization of our capital structure 
direct contribution  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are not recognized terms under us gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
adjusted effective tax rate and adjusted earnings per share also are not recognized terms under us gaap 
adjusted effective tax rate does not purport to be an alternative to the actual effective tax rate as a measure of the relationship between the income tax provision and earnings loss before income taxes  and adjusted earnings per share does not purport to be an alternative to diluted earnings per share as a measure of operating performance 
direct contribution is reconciled to consolidated earnings before income taxes in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the most direct comparable gaap financial measures of each other non gaap financial measure  as well as the reconciliation between each other non gaap financial measure and the gaap financial measure  are presented in the discussions of the non gaap financial measures below 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenue from sales of products  including chemicals and equipment  is recognized at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership and all risks of loss have been 
table of contents transferred to the buyer  which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided to the customer 
significant estimates used in recognizing revenues include the delay between the time that chemicals equipment are shipped and when they are received by customers and title transfers and the amount of credit memos to be issued in subsequent periods 
we provide our chemical and equipment offerings to our customers using various commercial arrangements  but the following are most commonly used ship and bill arrangements 
following the receipt of a purchase order from the customer  we invoice the customer at the time that the chemicals equipment are shipped  based on agreed pricing and the volume of chemicals shipped or units of equipment shipped 
at the end of each period  for those shipments where title to the product and the risks of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer  adjustments to revenues and cost of product sold are made to account for the delay between the time that the chemicals equipment are shipped and when they are received by the customer 
our sales policy does not provide for general rights of return and does not contain customer acceptance clauses 
usage with level billing arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we prepare an estimate of the chemicals that will be used by the customer 
as agreed with the customer  a fixed amount is invoiced monthly based on this estimate 
at the end of each quarter  we reconcile the actual amount of chemicals used by the customer and bill the customer for products actually used during that period 
revenue is recognized to reflect actual usage 
for any products not consumed in the customer s operations in a particular period  we retain ownership of such products on a consigned basis and do not recognize any revenue 
fixed fee arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we prepare an estimate of the chemicals that will be used by the customer during the contractual period  which is usually twelve months 
a fixed amount is automatically invoiced to the customer on a periodic basis  typically monthly 
we retain ownership  on a consigned basis  of any inventory at the customer site that is not consumed in the customer s operations in a particular period 
revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period  which is generally consistent with the customer s usage of the chemicals 
under these arrangements  as part of the sales cycle for our chemical programs  our technical and sales representatives may visit our customers facilities to develop and monitor the chemical programs 
typically  there is no contractual obligation for these visits  or any penalty for not visiting the customer sites 
during these visits  our employees perform routine testing activities to ensure that our chemical products functionalities are having the desired effect on the customers equipment eg  boilers  chillers and water treatment plants 
in the majority of instances  our customers perform the on going application of the chemicals 
at the same time  the sales representatives investigate and determine whether the customers have needs for additional applications from nalco 
we consider our technical and sales representatives activities in this regard to be an integral and inherent part of our selling process and not a separate deliverable for revenue recognition purposes 
some of our customers  however  look to us for our technical expertise only  without the purchase of chemicals equipment 
we offer specialized services designed to assess  control  and reduce risk from water borne pathogens such as legionella  and we provide other technical and analytical services 
we invoice for our services using various commercial arrangements  but the following arrangements are the most common perform and bill arrangements 
revenue is recognized in the same period that the related service is performed  based on the agreed pricing  which can be either a price per hour or a fixed fee 

table of contents fixed fee arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we estimate the saleable service that will be performed during a given period  usually twelve months 
a fixed amount is automatically invoiced to the customer on a periodic basis  which may be monthly  quarterly  or annually  either in arrears or in advance of the services provided 
because an unspecified number of similar acts are performed within a fixed period of performance  revenue is recognized ratably over the period of performance 
time and material arrangements 
the fee with the customer is structured on a time and material basis  and revenue is recognized in the same period that the work is completed 
in certain arrangements  which are usually reserved for our largest customers  we provide some combination or all of the following deliverables chemicals  equipment and on site technical expertise 
in these arrangements  we usually remain the owner of any equipment at the customer site 
at the end of the contractual relationship  the equipment is either recovered or sold to the customer or a competitor 
additionally  our representatives may have a regular presence at a customer s facility  which is provided under a contract 
over time  the representatives have gained a true expertise in the particular production water treatment process at the customer s facility  and are able to selectively apply our specific chemical programs given the customer environment water quality  equipment type  etc the regular presence of the representative permits us to closely track the results of the program and to make modifications to the program as necessary for the highest efficiency 
the following two types of commercial arrangements are the most commonly used for the sale of multiple deliverables production based arrangements 
our billing is based on a customer s production based formula eg  dollars per ton of paper produced within certain technical parameters 
we use a combination of our service chemicals  on site technical expertise and equipment to satisfy the customer requirement 
the chemicals and equipment used and on site technical expertise required are highly correlated with the customer s production 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the production based formula 
usage based arrangements 
for these arrangements  we invoice according to the consumption of chemicals by the customer 
the agreed price by kilogram or pound of chemical consumed also includes the availability of on site expertise and the use of equipment to satisfy the customer requirement 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the usage based formula 
for all of our commercial arrangements  we also record estimated reserves for anticipated non collectible accounts and for product returns and other credits at the time revenue is recognized 
impairment of long lived assets other than intangibles property  plant  and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows 
impairment testing of an asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such circumstances may include  for example  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset grouping  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition  a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping  or changes in the expected useful life of the long lived assets 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by that asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists 
if an asset group is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group s fair value and its carrying value 
the asset group s fair value is based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 

table of contents the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management s best estimate at the time of the impairment review 
factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce  inflation  etc 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
as of december   we had not identified any significant asset groups that had expected undiscounted future cash flows that were not substantially in excess of the carrying values  other than certain long lived assets held and used that were written down to their estimated fair value during  which resulted in an impairment loss of million 
porta feed stainless steel containers  utilized to ship chemicals  represent approximately of our property  plant and equipment and are managed globally to optimize the delivery of chemicals to customer and company sites around the world 
due to their high mobility  there is a risk that porta feed units could be damaged or lost in transit 
we perform continuous cycle counts of our porta feed units and when such counts are inconsistent with our tracking system  we investigate the discrepancy in order to locate the container 
if the porta feed unit is not found  we write off the asset immediately 
we capitalize qualifying costs incurred in the acquisition and development of software for internal use  including the costs of the software  materials  consultants  interest and payroll and payroll related costs for employees dedicated to the development 
we must use our judgment in determining whether the direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and an employee s time and travel expenses directly associated with developing software are recoverable and should be capitalized 
we base our determination on the nature and the extent of the activity that the employee is performing 
goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for possible impairment annually on the first day of our fourth quarter  october  or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying values of intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for possible impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we have defined our reportable segments as our reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  the reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value 
fair value is estimated using the market approach  as well as the income approach  based on discounted cash flow projections 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its identifiable assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we test the carrying value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the carrying value 
fair value is estimated using a relief of royalty approach  a discounted cash flow methodology  using market based royalty rates 
the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions 
table of contents could impact whether an impairment charge is required and  if so  the amount of such impairment 
future outcomes may also differ 
if we fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  experience unfavorable market conditions or achieve results that differ from our estimates  then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may be required to recognize impairment charges 
we performed our annual impairment test as of october  because the goodwill of our paper services reporting unit was written down to zero in  it was not necessary to include it in our annual impairment test for however  we did estimate its fair value in order to compare the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization as of october  the fair value of our reporting units was estimated based on a discounted projection of cash flows 
the rates used in determining discounted cash flows for each of our reporting units was a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income were considered that reflected business trends and market conditions 
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units as determined in the first step of our annual impairment test was reconciled to our market capitalization as of october  the aggregate fair value of our reporting units was higher than our market capitalization  which represented an implied control premium 
we believe this implied control premium is reasonable in light of market and economic conditions 
critical assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our water services and energy services reporting units for the impairment test included the discount rate and the terminal growth rate for each unit 
the following table summarizes those assumptions discount rate terminal growth rate water services energy services the results of the first step of our annual impairment test indicated that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values 
the following table presents the amount of headroom the percentage difference between each reporting unit s fair value and carrying value of our water services and energy services reporting units as of the date of our annual impairment test  october  headroom water services energy services headroom fair value carrying value carrying value  expressed as a percentage 
the following table presents the impact on the resultant headroom if there was a one percentage point change in the discount rate and terminal growth rate from what was actually used for the impairment test headroom as of october  water services energy services one percentage point increase in discount rate decrease in discount rate increase in terminal growth rate decrease in terminal growth rate 
table of contents pensions accounting for pensions involves the selection of a discount rate and an expected rate of return that we apply to a market related value of plan assets 
this methodology generally reduces the volatility of pension expense that would have otherwise resulted from changes in the value of the pension plan assets and pension liability discount rates 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities 
each year s expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate  thereby generating the overall discount rate for us pension obligations 
the discount rates for our foreign pension plans are selected by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in those countries that have developed corporate bond markets 
in those countries where developed corporate bond markets do not exist  the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds 
the assets in the principal domestic pension plan are diversified across equity and fixed income investments 
the investment portfolio has target allocations of approximately equity  fixed income and alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity 
other assets such as real estate may be used judiciously to enhance portfolio returns and diversification 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is established using historical market data for each asset class as well as the target allocation 
historical markets are analyzed and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income investments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility will generate a greater return over the long run 
active management is employed in most asset classes  which also contributes to the return assumption 
the total weighted average return on each asset class supports our long term expected rate of return assumption 
we review our long term rate of return assumptions annually 
while we believe our assumptions of future returns are reasonable and appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years in determining pension expense 
for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated pension expense  including settlements  of approximately million 
we expect pension expense  including forecasted settlements  to decrease to about million in holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of one quarter of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense and the benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively 
also  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return of one quarter of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense by approximately million 
other postretirement benefits accounting for other postretirement benefits requires the selection of a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of our future postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities 
each year s expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate  thereby generating the overall discount rate for our other postretirement benefit obligations 
we develop our estimate of the health care cost trend rates through review of our recent health care cost trend experience and discussions with our actuary regarding the experience of similar companies 
for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million  and we expect it to be approximately million in holding 
table of contents all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of one quarter of a percentage point would decrease increase other postretirement benefit expense by less than million 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on other postretirement benefit expense and the postretirement benefit obligation 
income taxes we estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this results in our recording deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet to recognize the temporary differences caused by the timing of recognition of income and expense for financial statement and tax purposes 
valuation allowances are recorded based on the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
relevant factors to determine the realizability of the assets include future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes 
valuation allowances are established for those assets that are determined to be more likely than not to expire without benefit  or for which income of the proper character is not anticipated 
the effect of a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset that is expected to originate in the current year is included in the annual effective tax rate for the year 
the effect of a change in the beginning of the year balance of a valuation allowance resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs 
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal  state and international jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax consequences of our operations  and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken 
however  these positions are subject to audit and review by the tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations  we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest and penalties for amounts that do not meet the more likely than not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by authoritative guidance issued by the fasb 
the tax reserves are reevaluated throughout the year  taking into account new legislation  regulations  case law and audit results 
environmental our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the use and handling of hazardous substances  waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar services  some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party  or prp  by the environmental protection agency or state enforcement agencies at seven waste sites where some financial contribution is or may be required 
these agencies have also identified many other parties who may be responsible for clean up costs at the waste disposal sites 
our financial contribution to remediate these sites is expected to be minor 
there has been no significant financial impact on us up to the present  nor is it anticipated that there will be in the future  as a result of these matters 
we have made and will continue to make provisions for these costs if our liability becomes probable and when costs can be reasonably estimated 
we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances  including multi party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services 
while we do not believe that based upon present information that any of these suits will be material to us  there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents historically  our expenditures relating to environmental compliance and clean up activities have not been significant 
the environmental reserves represent our current estimate of our proportional clean up costs and are based upon negotiation and agreement with enforcement agencies  our previous experience with respect to clean up activities  detailed review of known conditions  and information about other prps 
the reserves are not reduced by any possible recoveries from insurance companies or other prps not specifically identified 
although given the evolving nature of environmental regulations  we cannot determine whether or not a material effect on future operations is reasonably likely to occur  we believe that the recorded reserve levels are appropriate estimates of the potential liability 
although settlements will require future cash outlays  it is not expected that such outlays will materially impact our liquidity position  although there can be no assurance that such impacts could not occur 
executive level overview nalco delivered strong performance in against the top priorities we established at the beginning of the year  particularly given the very difficult business economy 
we made continued improvement in safety  maintaining top quartile status in our total recordable incident rate 
we significantly exceeded our goal of million in cost savings and efficiency improvements  by delivering million of ongoing productivity gains and an additional million of one time savings 
nearly two thirds of these savings were realized in cost of product sold  which contributed to the gross profit margin for increasing to from the for we focused on profitable growth opportunities by shifting our employee base to markets such as china and india  and by strengthening our executive leadership capability in growth markets 
we continued to expand the capabilities of our key technologies  such as d trasar  and we began to implement a commercial excellence project that is aimed at gaining market share by improving sales alignment with customer needs 
we substantially increased our cash flow by strengthening operating discipline  as we significantly reduced our days of inventory and receivables and extended payables 
we strengthened our future by expanding our research and development centers  commercializing new technologies  developing a comprehensive industrial water treatment strategy to broaden and differentiate our offerings in the industrial water market  and developing our brand as a sustainable solutions provider through extensive media coverage

a reduction in days investment in inventory to days from days 
an increase in accounts payable days outstanding to days from days 
the significant free cash flow generated during was mostly used to pay down more than million of debt  and our performance was instrumental in our ability to undertake refinancings that moved a significant portion of nearer term maturities to and beyond 
other significant items included in our financial results are the following we incurred million in restructuring expenses compared to million in  as we continuously redesign and optimize business and work processes 
the amount includes million of non cash asset impairment charges associated with plant closings  as we move to a more optimal manufacturing footprint 

table of contents a pension settlement charge of million was recognized in  as a result of an unusually high level of lump sum payments made to employees retiring in the us in connection with our debt repayments and refinancings  we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt 
outlook we are stepping up our growth efforts as we see the beginning of an economic recovery that should create increased demand for our expertise in creating an efficient  recyclable and reliable source of clean industrial water 
also  as energy costs continue to rise  our energy production and efficiency expertise has increased value to energy customers pursuing natural resources and industrial customers concerned with efficient use of energy and cost control 
against this backdrop of growing demand and our proven ability to strengthen our capabilities  even in a tumultuous business environment such as  our priorities in will start  as always  with safety  and will continue the focus on activities that improve our top and bottom line results 
first  continue to improve our safety performance 
second  generate focused  profitable growth by pursuing high growth geographies and industry segments  maintaining technological leadership  building upon our existing customer base  and benefiting from our global resource advantage 
third  increase the amount of time that our sales teams spend in front of customers identifying new performance improvement opportunities  creating solutions and selling new business  while reducing time spent on administrative tasks and low value activities 
fourth  continue to achieve improvements in productivity  with a goal of at least million in cost savings and efficiency gains 
fifth  generate free cash flow of more than million  recognizing that returning to growth will require more working capital dollars and capital investment 
sixth  continue to strengthen our future  by training and developing our employees  strengthening our technology leadership through continued market focused innovation  building the nalco brand  and increasing customer loyalty through a broader and more thorough implementation of our six service standards approach to customer service management 
we are optimistic about the success we can achieve in in a slowly recovering economy  because of our demonstrated capabilities in creating value for our customers and the increased customer emphasis on water  energy and air issues that drive our clean technology business 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were  million  a decrease of from the  million reported for the year ended december  on an organic basis  which excludes the impacts of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions and divestitures  net sales declined as a result of the weak global economic environment 
changes in foreign currency translation rates accounted for a drop in our sales  and the divestiture of our finishing technologies surface treatment business accounted for the majority of the remaining sales decline 
nominal  or actual  sales were lower in every region  with europe  africa and middle east down  and north america  asia pacific and latin america down   and respectively 
on an organic basis  latin america grew  but north america reported an organic decline of  europe  africa and middle east was down  and asia pacific was lower by gross profit  defined as the difference between net sales and cost of product sold  of  million for the year ended december  dropped million  or  from the  million for 
table of contents on an organic basis  gross profit decreased by  driven by the organic sales decline  however  the decline was successfully tempered by cost savings and process efficiencies 
as a result  the gross profit margin improved by percentage points to in compared to in selling  administrative  and research expenses for the year ended december  of  million decreased million  or  from the  million for the year ended december  organically  selling  administrative  and research expenses increased by million  or 
lower selling expenses  reflecting cost reductions and efficiencies achieved  were offset by higher administrative costs resulting from a settlement charge of million for the principal us pension plan  consulting costs to assist us with certain elements of our productivity initiatives  higher incentive plan expenses  and software asset write offs 
amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower amortization of customer relationships  which are amortized using an accelerated method that declines over time 
restructuring expenses were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to employee severance and related costs associated with the continuing redesign and optimization of business and work processes  the amount also includes million of asset impairment charges associated with planned plant closings to move to a more optimal manufacturing footprint 
gain on divestiture of million in resulted from the sale of our finishing technologies surface treatment business to chemetall corp  a subsidiary of rockwood holdings 
impairment of goodwill of million in represents the write off of all goodwill previously allocated to paper services at the time of the acquisition in the impairment resulted from a sharp deterioration in conditions within the paper industry and the general economy in late other income expense  net was a net expense of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
a million favorable change in foreign currency transaction gains and losses and other favorable period over period changes were offset by a million loss on extinguishment of debt in net interest expense  defined as the combination of interest income and interest expense  of million for the year ended december  was comparable to the million reported for the year ended december  the impacts of slightly lower average debt levels compared to the year ago period and lower interest expense on our euro denominated debt due to translation rate changes were offset by higher interest expense on our senior discount notes 
the tax provision for resulted in a effective income tax rate  significantly higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of 
this mostly resulted from an increase in valuation allowances of million during  which added percentage points to the effective income tax rate 
the valuation allowances were recorded for deferred tax assets that are not likely to be realized  and were due to losses in specific jurisdictions and reduced ability to utilize certain tax loss carryforwards

because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the euro denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment 
accordingly  changes in the value of the euro denominated debt are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  to offset changes in the value of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose financial statements are measured using the euro as their functional currency 
the carrying value of euro denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge was million at december  we formally assess  on a quarterly basis  whether the euro denominated debt is effective at offsetting changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash pretax loss in the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment account related to this hedge 
no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in income 
we also manage operational transactional foreign currency risk  particularly in emerging markets  by closely managing both pricing and raw material sourcing 
risks associated with foreign exchange translation exposures are not hedged 
we have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our derivative foreign currency instruments outstanding at december  and  a strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which those derivative foreign currency instruments are denominated would result in a gain or loss in fair values of less than million and million for the respective year 
at december   we had  million of variable rate debt 
a increase in the average interest rate would increase future interest expense by approximately million per year 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of the changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not reflect the effect of such changes on the related hedged transactions or on other operating transactions 
the analysis also does not factor in a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevailed 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the derivative financial instruments 
we limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a number of major financial institutions that meet our credit standards and that are expected to satisfy fully their obligations under the contracts 
we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and do not use them for speculative or trading purposes
