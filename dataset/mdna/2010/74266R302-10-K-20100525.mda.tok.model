overview we are an international provider and distributor of adult media content 
we acquire or license content from independent studios and directors and process these images into products suitable for popular media formats such as digital media content for broadcasting  mobile and internet distribution  and print publications and dvds 
in addition to media content  we also generate additional sales through the licensing of our private trademark to third parties 
on january  we expanded our internet operations through the acquisition of game link llc and its affiliates  companies engaged in digital distribution of adult content over the internet and ecommerce development 
gamelink is a leading us adult entertainment vod and ecommerce platform through its gamelink 
com website 
the site s installed user base represents over one million domestic and international customers and it serves over  users daily 
including  video titles  gamelink has one of the largest libraries of digital and physical adult media and novelties in the united states 
on october  we continued the ongoing expansion of our global digital media platform through the acquisition of sureflix digital distribution and its affiliates  companies engaged in the business of digital distribution of premium gay adult content 
sureflix is a leading global supplier of adult programming 
the company operates a vast network of more than pay per view vod websites and has a north american broadcast presence 
it represents premium production studios in global television broadcast cable  satellite  mobile  iptv and internet vod markets 
sureflix has not only in depth knowledge of adult programming  but also significant vod technology and marketing expertise 
we operate in a highly competitive  service oriented market and are subject to changes in business  economic and competitive conditions 
nearly all of our products compete with other products and services that utilize adult leisure time and disposable income 
although we believe our products are well established in the adult entertainment industry  we compete with entities selling adult oriented products via any type of distribution network  including the internet 
many of these products are similar to ours 
over the past few years  the adult entertainment industry has undergone significant change 
traditional producers of softcore content as well as mainstream providers of media content have shifted to producing hardcore content 
as a result  we face greater competition to distribute hardcore content 
this shift has also led to industry consolidation  creating fewer  more financially formidable competitors 
recently  the introduction of a large number of free content internet sites that allow users to access large libraries of content has created an even more challenging environment where both sales volume and margins are decreasing substantially 
in addition  the recent recession has shown that the adult industry is not immune to economic cycles 
despite serious challenges in the market for online content  we expect healthy growth going forward 
there are many reasons to be optimistic about our opportunities and our internet group has been working hard to position itself to take advantage of these opportunities 
the primary source of growth is expected to come from a significant increase in traffic to our online properties coupled with a much more sophisticated approach to traffic management 
we are rebuilding our signature property  private 
com  and are restructuring our affiliate programs in all properties to compete aggressively for affiliate traffic 
in addition to our technical systems  we have restructured our departments with resources highly skilled in affiliate traffic development and shifted our emphasis from account management towards sales 
we have also developed solutions for critical new markets gay  international  and mobile 
finally  we have increased our efforts to defend against piracy of our content and the propagation of pirated content 
the combination of the breadth of our premium assets and the scope of our market reach give us a unique and very defensible position 
during  the dvd market has continued to shrink  with sales for our physical products declining by 
however  the dvd business is by no means dead even in this competitive landscape 
the content providers that manage to survive the current clean out will control the dvd market going forward 
with respect to broadcasting  private is a leading adult content provider in europe currently partnering with iptv operators 
in addition to this we are providing content to leading pay tv operators 
our strategic partnerships prove to be solid and strong revenue generators and will continue to perform well 
private s mobile on portal revenues declined again in after years of strong growth 
we are still the most distributed adult brand in the world and will monetize existing distribution as best as we can by going live with the few outstanding carriers and replacing non performing content aggregators with new ones 
throughout and there has been a huge increase in off portal traffic 
according to research firm nielsen  the mobile internet market has seen a increase between february and february we are in the process of enabling smart phone users to browse  purchase and consume our library of content on all of our web properties and expect to generate substantial growth from this initiative in the second half of through the acquisition of gamelink and sureflix  private acquired a team of the most innovative and experienced developers in the adult industry who will lead a product development effort focused on a clear goal increasing qualified traffic to our web properties 
there are three key strategies opening our services to third parties to develop products on top of our platform  developing applications that give our content hooks into emerging markets and devices  and developing widgets that will merge the unique data analytics we have with our vast product offering and enable sites to easily leverage our catalog and transactional capabilities to their customers 
one movie all screens the vod landscape is an endless field of format proliferation 
consumers are forced to purchase the same movie in a variety of different formats at various price points in order to view it on different devices 
our goal is to provide our customers with the ability to watch any movie in our catalog on any screen available to them 
in addition to our r d efforts for traffic generation  we will continue to explore the most effective way to enable customers to view our movies on all screens 
the primary focus of our r d efforts will be on delivering content to the tv and enabling purchase and consumption on smart phones 
we generate revenues primarily through internet e commerce  subscriptions and licensing  the broadcasting of movies through iptv internet protocol television  cable  satellite and hotel television programming  sales of dvds and magazines  sales of adult mobile content  bb on portal and bc off portal wireless  and content  brand name and trademark licensing 
the following table illustrates our net sales by product group for the periods indicated 
years ended december  eur eur eur in thousands net sales by product group internet broadcasting dvds magazines wireless total over time  we expect net sales from dvds magazines to continue to decline as a percentage of net sales in relation to total net sales from internet  broadcasting and wireless 
we expect net sales from internet and wireless broadcasting to grow during the coming years 
we recognize net sales on delivery for further information  see critical accounting estimates 
even though we recognize net sales upon delivery  we generally provide extended payment terms to our distributors of between and days 
although our extended payment terms increase our exposure to accounts receivable write offs  we believe our risk is minimized by our generally long term relationships with our distributors 
in addition  we view our extended payment terms as an investment in our distribution channels which are important to the growth of our business 
our primary expenses include acquisition and licensing of content for our library of photographs and videos  web page development costs  printing  processing and duplication costs  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we released  and proprietary video titles during  and  respectively 
the releases include both new and archival material 
we plan to release approximately proprietary video titles in over the years  our cost of sales has been fluctuating relative to net sales due to our use of new mediums for our products  such as the internet  dvd broadcasting and wireless 
we also incur significant intangible expenses in connection with the amortization of our library of photographs and movies and capitalized development costs  which include the internet 
we amortize these tangible and intangible assets on a straight line basis for periods of between three and five years 
restructuring during we have faced several organizational challenges as a result of the acquisitions and integration of the online businesses gamelink and sureflix into the group 
parallel with the integration  we are rebuilding our signature property  private 
com  and restructuring our affiliate programs in all properties to compete aggressively for affiliate traffic 
in addition  we have restructured our departments with resources highly skilled in affiliate traffic development and shifted our emphasis from account management towards sales 
we have also developed solutions for critical new markets gay  international and mobile 
furthermore  as a response to decreased margins in the adult entertainment industry  we have reviewed  analyzed and continued to restructure the operations of the non online part of the business in order to become more cost effective 
all the aforementioned processes have had impact both in terms of lost sales and additional selling  general and administrative expenses 
however  discounting non recurring expenses and the addition of our newly acquired on line companies  we reduced selling  general and administrative expenses by eur million in compared to furthermore  as a result of a new content strategy established in response to declining sales and margins from our traditional dvd business  we reduced our investment in library by eur million  or  compared to as part of the strategy  we also reduced the number of titles released by compared to with respect to revising content requirements and related investment we analyzed sales statistics for newly produced content vs 
compilations  reviewed demand for newly produced content from digital new media distribution vs 
traditional physical delivery and analyzed sales statistics with respect to our content mix 
results indicated that a revised content strategy based on fewer releases and a different mix would have the desired effect on margins since unlike our traditional business digital new media distribution is mainly dependent on our expansive library and not on new releases 
in reducing our investment in library  we also renegotiated content acquisition and post production agreements with third parties on favorable conditions to us 
we expect to maintain our revised content strategy going forward 
during  we expect to benefit from the restructuring and reduce costs and increase sales as we implement and launch new initiatives  such as fully combining our internet assets  outsourcing major parts of our non online operations and launching our new internet platforms 
critical accounting estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of the library of photographs and videos and other long lived assets  allowances for bad debt  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
accounts receivable and sales related to certain products are  in accordance with industry practice  subject to distributors right of return to unsold items 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
management periodically reviews such estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of unexpected changes in trends 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are significantly affected by judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
recognition of revenue the company s primary sources of revenue are the sale of content delivered via internet  broadcasting  dvd magazines and mobile phones 
internet video on demand offerings are sold directly via the company s online retail websites and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
the company recognizes revenue from video on demand when the service is rendered and collectability is reasonably assured  specifically  when the customer s credit card is charged  which is  in most cases  simultaneous with delivery of the on demand video 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce the company s collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
the company also offers a prepaid video on demand service in which a customer purchases a number of minutes of on demand video at a set rate per minute based on the number of minutes purchased 
the rate per minute decreases as the number of prepaid minutes increases 
the company records revenue from pre pay customers as deferred revenue prior to commencement of services and recognizes revenue as the services are rendered 
prepaid minutes purchased under this program do not expire 
the company also offers a customer loyalty program under which each member s purchase of video on demand  dvds  movie downloads  books  novelties or other items earns the member one point for each dollar spent 
after accumulating points  a customer may redeem the points for a purchase 
points increase in value as they are accumulated and redeemed  with a maximum accumulation of  points  which may be redeemed for a purchase 
all of a customer s points expire after days of no purchase activity 
because the value of the award points is not significant in relation to the value of the services or products purchased by the customer  the company records a liability for the estimated cost of the discounted services or products to be provided in the future 
revenues from the sale of subscriptions to the company s internet website are deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period 
iptv internet protocol television  satellite cable broadcasting revenues are recognized upon delivery when the following conditions have been met i license period of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation  exhibition  or sale ii the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable and iii collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
such revenues may be generated by either a fixed license fee or as an agreed percentage of sales  based on sales reported each month by the company s iptv  cable and satellite affiliates 
the affiliates do not report actual monthly sales for each of their systems to the company until approximately days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on historical experience for each affiliated system 
revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt 
adjustments made to adjust revenue from estimated to actual have historically been immaterial 
dvds magazines physical products are sold both to wholesalers  on firm sale basis  and via national newsstand distributors  with the right to return 
our physical products are generally multi lingual and the principal market is in europe 
revenues from the sale of physical products where distributors are not granted rights of return are recognized upon transfer of title  which generally occurs upon delivery 
revenues from the sale of physical products under consignment agreements with distributors are recognized based upon reported sales by the company s distributors 
revenues from the sale of physical products under agreements that grant distributors rights of return are recognized upon transfer of title  which generally occurs on delivery  net of an allowance for returned product 
distributors with the right to return are primarily national newsstand distributors 
most of our products are bi monthly six issues per year and remain on sale at a newsstand for a period of two months 
normally  all unsolds are reported to us within a period of four to six months from delivery 
there are normally two to four national newsstand distributors for all newspapers and periodicals operating in each country 
a majority of our national newsstand distributors are members of distripress  the international organization for publishers and distributors  and carry out the distribution of the largest national and international newspapers and periodicals  including financial times  herald tribune  time  newsweek  vogue  etc 
the company uses specific return percentages per title and distributor based on estimates and historical data 
the percentages vary from 
percentages are reviewed on an on going basis 
magazines have an approximate retail price of eur usd per copy and are printed on glossy high quality paper at a cost of eur usd 
they are often shrink wrapped in order to comply with local regulation or guidance for the sale of adult publications 
in view of the high retail price  the margin and the physical quality of the magazines and the fact that the content has a very long shelf life since it is not particularly linked to time  trends  fashion or current events  the company has always collected the returns from newsstands in order to make them available for sale again 
the company operates scheduled re distribution of returned magazines  via national newsstand distributors  together with dvds as magazine dvd packs as a way of increasing dvd distribution 
since the national newsstand distributors have the right to return  the dvd packs are returned and the magazines are broken out in order to be sold via an additional scheduled re distribution as megapacks and superpacks three different copies per pack 
returns from the sale of megapacks and superpacks are destroyed 
the retail price for products sold via re distribution vary between eur usd 
magazine returns not re distributed as per above are sold on a firm sale basis to wholesalers as back numbers at a lower price than new issues 
the company has historically sold all returned copies at an average price higher than  or equal  to cost 
revenues from mobile content wireless sales are recognized based on sales reported each month by mobile operators via aggregators 
the aggregators do not report actual monthly sales for each of their operators to the company until approximately days after the month of service ends 
this practice requires management to make monthly revenue estimates based on historical experience for each affiliated system 
revenue is subsequently adjusted to reflect the actual amount earned upon receipt 
adjustments made to adjust revenue from estimated to actual have historically been immaterial 
accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables and notes receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
significant changes in required reserves have been recorded in the past and may occur in the future due to the current market environment 
management reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts on at least a quarterly basis and adjusts the balance based on their estimate of the collectability of specific accounts as well as a reserve for a portion of other accounts which have been outstanding for more than days 
this estimate is based on historical losses and information about specific customers 
after collection attempts have failed  the company writes off the specific account 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
other intangible assets represents the value attributable to a customer base  which was acquired from two of the company s former distributors in the us and in canada in and  respectively  see note 
the amortization expense is calculated on a straight line basis over years for each acquisition  b broadcasting asset  which was acquired from international film production and distribution limited in see note 
at the time of acquisition  the asset was deemed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization  and c trade and domain names  which were acquired from gamelink and sureflix see notes and 
at the time of acquisition  the assets were deemed to have an indefinite life and are not subject to amortization 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise  see note and further separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life are amortized over their expected useful lives 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets including its library of photographs and videos for potential impairment 
upon indication of impairment  the company will record a loss on its long lived assets if the undiscounted cash flows that are estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the related carrying value of the assets 
an impairment loss is then measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated discounted future cash flows 
management s estimated future revenues are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions and additional write downs may be required if actual conditions are less favorable than those assumed 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost principally determined on an average basis 
inventories principally consist of dvd s and magazines held for sale or resale 
the inventory is written down to the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
in december  we wrote down the magazine inventory by eur million

the increase over the comparable twelve month period is principally due to increased investment in the library and the absence of cash flows from note receivable and cash received from sale of building in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was eur million  represented primarily by net additions to long term borrowings of eur million offset by eur million in net reduction of short term borrowings  see note borrowings  in the consolidated financial statements for further information 
net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was eur million  represented primarily by additions to short term borrowings of eur million offset by eur million in repayments on short and long term borrowings 
net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was eur million  represented primarily by additions to short term borrowings of eur million as a result of increased bank line of credits offset by eur million in repayments on short and long term borrowings 
the main movements during the twelve month period ended december  are described as follows the balance of eur million on the eur million loan from an institutional lender was reduced by eur million and as of december  the remaining balance on the loan was eur million 
the million note held by consipio holding bv was reduced by eur million 
as of december  the remaining balance on the note was eur million 
the outstanding borrowings on our credit lines were increased by eur million and as of december  the outstanding balance was eur million 
liquidity in each of the past three years we have experienced losses from operations 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of eur  as a result of our operating losses our independent registered public accounting firm has concluded that there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern  and have modified their report in the form of an explanatory paragraph describing the events that have given rise to this uncertainty 
our ability to continue as a going concern is based on our ability to generate or obtain sufficient cash to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitable operations 
we currently expect future growth and to return to profitability provided we are successful with the following objectives rolling out our internet platforms  including a our newly built signature property and membership platform private 
com  b our cutting edge mobile platform for smartphones and c our multinational ecommerce vod platform  restructuring our affiliate programs on all properties to compete aggressively for  and attract  affiliate traffic  continuing the rollout of our content on cable and iptv video on demand platforms  completing the integration of businesses acquired in  consolidating and restructuring our operations into an efficient new media business  outsourcing of non cost effective parts of our operations  and identifying and exploring new online business opportunities which are less dependent on content 
if we are not successful in implementing the above objectives  or if we otherwise do not successfully respond to changing conditions in the adult entertainment industry  we may continue to incur significant losses 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate profitably in the future 
although we expect that our available cash resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months  we may need to raise additional funds to support more rapid growth or respond to unanticipated requirements 
in this regard  we are presently engaged in a dispute with a third party lender regarding our obligations under a promissory note 
an adverse outcome in this dispute would likely have a material impact upon our liquidity if we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing to satisfy any resulting liability 
see note to the consolidated financial statements under other debt for additional information regarding this obligation 
we currently have no additional availability under our existing credit facilities 
the existence of a going concern exception by our auditors may make it more difficult to obtain additional bank financing if and when required 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders percentage ownership will be reduced  they may experience additional dilution  or these newly issued equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of our current shareholders 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us  or at all 
in this regard  in the past most of our bank financing has included the guaranty of affiliated companies of our chairman and principal shareholder  berth milton  and a pledge of shares of common stock owned by him or his affiliated companies 
we cannot assure you that mr 
milton or his affiliated companies will guaranty future debt financings or that such guaranties will be sufficient to obtain future debt financings 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities  maintain the scope of our operations or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  which could harm our business 
outlook we have been transitioning our business model from linear to digital content production and distribution over the past two years and this has affected our margins 
as dvd and magazines sales have rapidly declined  we have made substantial progress moving to a digital business model with significant new media distribution deals and the monetization of our expansive library of content 
we are now a leading adult content provider on the internet and on all major digital platforms in europe  and as we continue to build out and get larger  we project significant growth in both sales and net income 
specifically  we project the biggest gains to be achieved through internet  broadcasting and wireless 
during the twelve month period ending december   these platforms were responsible for percent of our sales compared to for the same period last year and in following is a discussion highlighting some of the important factors of our business going forward 
internet in january  we expanded our internet operations through the acquisition of game link llc and its affiliates  companies engaged in digital distribution of adult content over the internet and ecommerce development 
gamelink is a leading us adult entertainment vod and ecommerce platform through its gamelink 
com website 
the site s installed user base represents over one million domestic and international customers and it serves over  users daily 
including  video titles  gamelink has the largest library of digital and physical adult media and novelties in the united states 
the company offers vod in multiple media formats including streaming and downloads to computers and iphones 
gamelink s infrastructure is the most robust in the industry and is highly flexible  customizable and scalable designed to support multiple retail strategies and products simultaneously 
additionally  through its related companies  gamelink offers third party and white label ecommerce solutions and development 
in october  we continued the ongoing expansion of our global digital media platform through the acquisition of sureflix digital distribution and its affiliates  companies engaged in the business of digital distribution of premium gay adult content 
sureflix is a leading global supplier of adult programming 
the company operates a vast network of more than pay per view vod websites and has a north american broadcast presence 
it represents premium production studios in global television broadcast cable  satellite  mobile  iptv and internet vod markets 
sureflix has not only in depth knowledge of adult programming  but also significant vod technology and affiliate program marketing expertise 
the acquisitions of gamelink and sureflix are a significant development that will substantially contribute to our growth  while creating economies of scale 
as part of our digital strategy  we have established that the combination of private with major online retailers and accomplished platform developers is the approach to achieving our goals in the rapidly changing business landscape 
the combined content assets of private and core competencies of gamelink and sureflix offer a compelling new business model 
we will be expanding our joint internet strategies globally with new formats and applications to be launched in in may this year we are launching our new private 
com membership platform which we have been building since mid the new platform will feature a number of proprietary sites and it will also be available as a white label version which we expect will attract adult content providers affiliate worldwide 
the new platform is forecasted to improve conversion rates and receive times more traffic compared to our existing membership platform 
in addition  the new platform has been built to be substantially less labor intensive to operate compared to the existing one 
following the rollout of the new membership platform  we will launch a new video on demand platform following the same concept 
both of the new platforms will be available in localized versions with respect to language and payment options 
additionally  we will be developing improved interactive functionality for new media platforms such as iptv and mobile  and maximizing our content monetization with the existing vast private library as well as aggregation of select international studios offering a wide range of content and genres for all platform needs 
in april this year  gamelink  launched a proprietary mobile solution enabling users to instantly stream over  movies 
the platform is initially available on smartphones such as the iphone and android phones at the url www 
gamelink 
com 
the mobile internet platform is an extension of gamelink s leading video on demand e commerce platform  allowing consumers to purchase and consume content instantly 
all content is available for future viewing in the customer s virtual media center  stored in the company s cloud 
the platform has been optimized to work with apple devices including the iphone  ipod  the ipad as well as android devices 
in addition to streaming  consumers can choose to download their movies or purchase dvds and novelties from the globally accessible platform 
a white label version of the mobile platform is available and is being marketed to adult studios and affiliates worldwide 
our objective is to become the main provider of an off portal mobile platform solution to all major content providers in our industry 
in contrast to private s existing mobile content business  which is based on an on portal model going through content aggregators and carriers  this new business is off portal and provides substantially improved margins as content is sold directly by private to the consumer 
broadcasting we are continuing to implement our new media strategy for growth of vod video on demand via iptv and to date we have contracted with major platform operators in countries in europe  as the leading supplier of adult content 
currently we have gained more than coverage of the european iptv market and across all platforms 
going forward  we expect to increase our market coverage in this expanding market 
furthermore  the introduction of iptv in europe has challenged the cable tv industry and subsequently cable operators are rapidly upgrading their systems to provide the same functionality as iptv 
in we have contracted with two leading cable operators in western europe and going forward we expect to add further cable vod platforms to our portfolio 
in relation to private branded tv channels carrying our content in europe and latin america our partners playboy tv latin america and playboy tv international continue to improve distribution 
during the past twelve months  playboy tv latin america increased the distribution significantly in brazil  argentina and central america and we expect to see positive impact from this going forward 
wireless adult mobile content private s mobile on portal revenues declined again in after years of strong growth 
we are still the most distributed adult brand in the world and will monetize existing distribution as best as we can by going live with the few outstanding carriers and replacing non performing content aggregators with new ones 
throughout and there has been a huge increase in mobile off portal traffic and currently of all searches on google are made from mobile phones 
with the smartphone market growing rapidly  we are in the process of enabling smartphone users to browse  purchase and consume our library of content on all of our web properties and expect to generate substantial growth from this initiative already in the second half of dvds magazines as we further transition into global digital content delivery  dvd pricing and volume is being affected considerably and as a result the industry in general is experiencing a severe downturn in dvd sales 
in view of the aforementioned  we continue to re strategize our distribution of dvds and magazines to reduce any further negative impact of this downward dvd trend
