item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our primary businesses are in the defense and transportation industries 
for the year ended september   of sales were derived from defense systems and services  while were derived from transportation fare collection systems and other commercial operations 
these are high technology businesses that design  manufacture and integrate complex systems to meet the needs of various federal and regional government agencies in the us and other nations around the world 
the us government remains our largest customer  accounting for approximately of sales in compared to in and in cubic transportation systems cts develops and delivers innovative fare collection systems for public transit authorities worldwide 
we provide hardware  software and multiagency  multimodal transportation integration technologies and a full scope of operational services that allow the agencies to efficiently collect fares  manage their operations  reduce shrinkage and make using public transit a more convenient and attractive option for commuters

the segment is a diversified supplier of live and virtual military training systems  and communication systems and products to the us department of defense  other government agencies and allied nations 
we design instrumented range systems for fighter aircraft  armored vehicles and infantry force on force live training  weapons effects simulations  laser based tactical and communication systems  and precision gunnery solutions 
our communications products are aimed at intelligence  surveillance  and search and rescue markets 
in  through two acquisitions  we added new product lines including multi band communication tracking devices  and cross domain hardware solutions to address multi level security requirements

consolidated overview sales increased in fiscal after increasing in  due to growth in all three business segments in both years 
sales grew to billion in  compared to billion in and million in more than of the growth in was organic  while the remainder came from the consolidation of transys  a variable interest entity vie  this year and from two small acquisitions we made during the year 
the vie added million to sales  however these sales were at break even against costs and therefore had no effect on operating income 
sales growth in without consolidation of the vie would have been approximately 
in  approximately of the growth was organic  with the remainder coming from acquisitions we made in and late in see the segment discussions following for further information about segment sales 
our operating income increased in to million from million in last year s results had included a provision for an uncollectable receivable of million  however  this year we were able to recover the full amount plus attorney s fees  costs and interest  bringing the total recovery to million 
if the million were subtracted from the results and million added back to the results  operating income would have increased about in  commensurate with the increase in sales 
operating income had increased in fiscal from million in the results had included a restructuring charge of million and an operating loss of million in the communications business within cds 
see the segment discussions following for further information about segment operating income 
net income increased to million per share in from million per share in and million per share in higher net income in both and resulted primarily from the improvement in operating income  as described above 
in  lower investment income  due to lower interest rates  partially offset the increase in operating income 
the results in had also included a provision for settlement of a lawsuit of million that reduced net income by approximately million  after applicable income taxes  or per share 
the results had included a gain of million on the sale of our investment in a defense related joint venture that added approximately million to net income  after applicable income taxes  or per share 
reductions in tax contingency reserves accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the  and net income 
the gross margin from product sales was in compared to in and in improved performance from the cds training systems business accounted for the increase in while improvement in the cds communications business had contributed to the increase in the gross margin from service sales was in compared to in and in the primary reason for the decrease in was the consolidation of transys  as mentioned above 
this added nearly million to sales in  but at a very low gross margin  because this vie was designed as a pass through entity and is intended to break even 
in addition  mss recorded a provision of million in for a dispute with a customer over contract terms  further decreasing the services gross margin 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million or of sales in compared to million  or of sales  in  and million  or of sales  in the increase in is due primarily to increased bid and proposal costs  and growth of our business in australia 
reversal in of the bad debt provision of million made in partially offset the increase in sg a from to sg a had increased in due to the million bad debt provision and from the businesses acquired in and late in amortization expense increased to million or of sales in compared to million  or of sales  in  and million  or of sales  in the increase in was due primarily to the two small defense systems acquisitions made in  while the increase in was a result of the acquisition of omega training group inc omega late in company sponsored research and development r d spending was million in compared to million in and million in we increased r d spending in primarily related to new technologies for ground combat training systems in our defense systems business 
in addition  we acquired two small businesses in the third quarter of and have invested in the development of their products for cyber security and global asset tracking in the fourth quarter 
a significant portion of our r d spending is incurred in connection with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required development activity in was million  compared to million in and million in  however  these costs are included in cost of sales  rather than r d  as they are directly related to contract performance 
interest and dividend income remained low in  despite higher cash balances available for investment  due to low interest rates earned on our cash and short term investments 
interest and dividend income was million in and million in  compared to million in other income expense netted to income of million in and million in compared to an expense of million in in and we realized foreign currency exchange gains on advances to our foreign subsidiaries  compared to a loss in interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in and million in due to a reduction in long term borrowings over the three year period 
our effective tax rate for was of pretax income compared to in and in the effective rate decreased in compared to primarily because of the reversal of tax contingency provisions  due to the expiration of statutes  totaling million compared to only million in in addition  we did not provide for us taxes on earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in  as we consider them to be permanently reinvested 
these factors were partially offset by a lower research and experimentation r e credit realized in because us congress allowed the credit to expire as of december  the effective rate had decreased in from because of a higher r e credit due in part to an increase in qualifying activity 
the r e credit for had also included million from fiscal that was not realized until because the credit had expired and was not reinstated by the us congress until the fiscal year 
higher income in the us added to our effective tax rate in due to higher state income taxes  however  this was partially offset by a lower provision for taxes from foreign earnings repatriation 
the effective rate in had also benefited from the reversal of tax contingency provisions of million  due to the expiration of statutes 
our effective tax rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits  and audits of our records by taxing authorities 
transportation systems segment years ended september  in millions transportation systems sales transportation systems operating income cts sales increased in to million from million in sales were higher in from work in the san francisco bay area  our contract with transport for london tfl  the installation of a gating system in southern california and from our new contract in sydney  australia 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales from a system installation contract in florida  which was completed early in the year  and from train operating companies in the uk a portion of the sales increase from the tfl contract this year resulted from consolidation of the company s owned subsidiary  transys  beginning in march of this year 
this newly consolidated subsidiary added million to sales in the average exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar was nearly identical in as in  resulting in virtually no impact on sales for compared to cts sales had increased  from million in to million in sales had increased in north america from a fare collection development contract awarded in  from the sale of spare parts and from contracts we added in a service business acquisition made in july in the uk  higher sales came primarily from contracts with tfl and uk train operating companies  however  a lower average exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar in had resulted in a decrease in the dollar value of uk sales of million compared to the rate in effect in operating income from cts increased in to million from million in increased income resulted from higher sales and margins in north america and from slightly higher operating profits from european operations 
a contract modification received in resolved a contingency on a contract in europe  allowing us to reverse a reserve of million 
results in had also included contract restructuring agreements that added million to operating income and a foreign currency exchange gain that added million 
results from european operations for also include a pension curtailment charge of million 
the additional sales from transys mentioned above did not add to operating income  because transys operates on a break even basis  as it was designed to do 
the average exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar was nearly identical in as in  resulting in virtually no impact on operating income for compared to cts operating income had improved to million in from million in  a increase 
higher sales of spare parts added to operating income in as well as the contract restructuring agreements and currency gain mentioned above 
as a result of one of the contract restructurings  we wrote off accounts receivable of million against the associated allowance for doubtful accounts  resulting in no impact on operating income 
in addition  the successful completion of a new fare collection system in north america had resulted in an additional contribution to operating income in although operating income in the uk was higher in than in as a result of higher sales  the lower british pound vs 
us dollar exchange rate had negatively impacted operating income by million in defense systems segment years ended september  in millions defense systems sales training systems communications other defense systems operating income training systems communications other training systems training systems sales increased in to million compared to million in sales were higher in from all major product lines  including air and ground combat training systems  miles multiple integrated laser engagement simulation equipment  and small arms training systems 
significant deliveries  in the fourth quarter  of air combat training systems to the us military helped to push sales higher for the year  more than offsetting lower air combat training sales to customers in the far east 
sales were also higher for the year from a ground combat training system we are building for a customer in the far east 
sales had increased to million in  a increase over sales of million 
in  sales of small arms virtual training systems and air combat training systems had increased compared to  while ground combat training systems sales had decreased 
sales were higher in than in from the air combat training system contract known as p and from air combat training sales to the far east 
sales were lower in from ground combat training systems in the uk and canada 
training systems operating income increased in to million  from million in higher sales from the ground combat training system in the far east mentioned above added to operating income in  as well as higher sales and improved profit margins from miles 
in addition  in we had established a million allowance for doubtful accounts receivable related to a company through which we sold training systems products to the us government because they failed to pass on to us cash they collected from the government on our behalf 
in  we were able to collect the entire amount plus attorney s fees  costs and interest  for a total recovery in of million 
these improvements were partially offset by lower operating income from lower sales of air combat training systems to customers in the far east where we had realized higher margins last year 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we invested million in the development of new ground combat training technology for tactical vehicles  which limited growth in our operating income in we expect further orders of this new system in future periods that will provide opportunities to recoup this investment 
operating income in had more than doubled to million from million in higher sales of air combat training systems and small arms virtual training systems in and higher profit margins on air combat training systems in the far east had contributed to the improvement in over in addition  the results had included cost growth for the development of the next generation of miles  which totaled million compared to million in product shipments on this contract began in contributing to the improved results for the year compared to communications communications sales grew in to million from million in sales were higher in from all three major product lines  including personnel locator systems  data links and power amplifiers 
we began work on a new contract in called video scout and produced spare parts for the joint stars system we delivered years ago  which contributed to the increase in data link sales 
communications sales had improved to million in over sales of million 
in  a settlement agreement reached with the us navy on a data link development contract had added million to sales and facilitated progress toward completion of the contract  further increasing sales for the year 
sales were also higher in than from a contract to develop a data link for unmanned aerial vehicles for a uk customer 
lower sales of power amplifiers in had partially offset the growth in data link sales for the year 
communications operating income increased to million in  compared to million in  which is a increase 
in  higher operating income on higher sales from all three product lines was partially offset by development costs for new products  including video scout and a miniaturized common data link 
in  operating income had improved dramatically from the million loss we incurred in the settlement agreement with the us navy referred to above had no significant impact on operating income 
the operating loss in had resulted from cost growth on three data link development contracts  however  in two of the three contracts generated operating income due to contract restructurings and change orders received 
lower sales of power amplifiers in had resulted in lower operating income than in  partially offsetting the improvements in profitability from the data link contracts 
other in  cds added two new businesses through acquisitions that are developing cyber security and global asset tracking products 
subsequent to the acquisitions we have continued to invest in development of these product lines 
these costs are reflected in the operating loss in the other caption on the table above 
results in had included sales from a vie that we sold in mission support services segment years ended september  in millions mission support services sales mission support services operating income mss sales increased in over compared to a increase in over increased activity at the joint readiness training center jrtc in fort polk  la and at the us army quartermaster center and school added to sales in both and in addition  higher sales from two contracts with the us marine corps and a contract at the joint warfighting center jwfc added to the sales total in compared to partially offsetting these improvements in were lower sales from a trainer maintenance contract that we lost to a small business competitor and from a contract for services performed in iraq that had added approximately million to sales in  but was completed 
in we have also lost a number of individual positions on our contracts due to expanded us department of defense in sourcing policies that have limited mss growth and may continue to do so in the near term 
about half of the sales increase in had come from omega  the company we acquired at the end of july mss operating income decreased to million in from million in during the first quarter of we recorded a provision of million for a dispute with a customer over contract terms 
we are continuing to pursue alternatives for resolution that could lead to ultimate recovery of the full amount 
at this time  however  we cannot quantify or determine the likelihood of recovery 
the contract in iraq mentioned above that was completed in also had added to operating income in higher operating income on higher sales in from the contracts mentioned above partially offset these decreases when compared to operating income from mss had increased less than in to from million in in  higher sales from the jrtc contract had helped to increase operating profits compared to  in addition to better performance from certain operations and maintenance contracts 
however  we realized lower operating income in from a new us marine corps contract  as it was competitively bid at a lower profit margin than we had experienced from the previous marine corps contract 
in  a contract modification that reimbursed us for out of scope costs we had incurred in related to the completed marine corps contract  had added million to operating income 
however  offsetting this in was a reserve of million we provided for settlement of a wage related lawsuit on one of our contracts in california 
in addition  the new company  omega  had contributed over million to operating income in the first two months we owned it in  however  the contract that generated much of that profit was scaled back significantly in  resulting in lower operating income 
amortization of purchased intangibles included in the mss results amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
backlog september  in millions total backlog transportation systems mission support services defense systems training systems communications other total defense systems total funded backlog transportation systems mission support services defense systems training systems communications other total defense systems total the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multiyear service contracts 
funding for these contracts comes from annual operating budgets of the us government and the options are normally exercised annually 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised 
in addition to the amounts identified above  we have been selected as a participant in or  in some cases  the sole contractor for several substantial indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
idiq contracts are not included in backlog until an order is received 
a decrease in the value of the british pound vs 
the us dollar between september  and september   resulted in a decrease in transportation systems backlog of approximately million 
new accounting standards in december the fasb issued an accounting standard that applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses 
this standard applies to all business entities  including mutual entities that previously used the pooling of interests method of accounting for some business combinations 
we adopted this standard in the fiscal year beginning october  with no material impact to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the future impact of this standard will depend on the size and structure of future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this standard in the fiscal year beginning october  with no material impact to our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued a standard which expands the disclosure requirements about plan assets for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans 
this standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december   which for us is this fiscal year 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued a standard which changes the approach in determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity  and modifies the methods allowed for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
in addition  this standard requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and enhanced disclosures related to an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this standard is effective for the first annual reporting period that begins after november   which for us will be the fiscal year beginning october  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the future impact of this standard will depend on the size and structure of future investments in variable interest entities 
in october  the fasb issued revised accounting guidance relating to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which can be applied prospectively or retrospectively 
this guidance modifies the objective and reliable evidence of fair value criterion from the separation criteria used to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting  replaces references to fair value with selling price to distinguish from the fair value measurement required under the fair value measurements and disclosures guidance  provides a hierarchy that entities must use to estimate the selling price  eliminates the use of the residual method for allocation  and expands the ongoing disclosure requirements 
this revised guidance is effective for new or materially modified arrangements in fiscal years beginning on or after june   although early adoption is allowed 
we have elected to early adopt this guidance prospectively as of october  the adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued an accounting standard that requires all entities to provide information about movements of assets among level and of the three tier fair value hierarchy  and provide a reconciliation of purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of anything valued with a level method 
this standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to million in  and million in in addition to cash generated by earnings  a decrease in accounts receivable in each of the three years amounting to million  million and million in  and  respectively  contributed to the positive cash flows 
in addition  net customer advances of million  million and million in  and  respectively  added to the positive result 
a decrease in inventory of million also contributed to the positive results in for and  an increase in inventory partially offset the improvements  using cash of million and million  respectively 
positive operating cash flows in  and came from all three segments 
in and  cts provided the greatest portion of the positive cash flows  while in  cds provided more than half of the operating cash flows 
partially offsetting the positive operating cash flows for was a payment of million in value added tax vat during the third quarter  related to the wind up of the prestige contract within transys  our owned variable interest entity 
we consolidated transys with our results for the first time in the second quarter of  adding cash of million to investing activities  a portion of which was used to make this vat payment which is included in operating activities 
we have classified certain unbilled accounts receivable balances as noncurrent because we do not expect to receive payment within one year from the balance sheet date 
at september   this balance was million compared to million at september  the increase came from a transportation related contract in north america that included long term financing provided to the customer 
cash flows used in investing activities in included million for two small defense systems acquisitions made during the year  and an additional payment of million for a transportation systems acquisition made in as mentioned above  the consolidation of transys added million to cash from investing activities 
we also made normal capital expenditures of million and net purchases of short term investments totaling million in in  two transportation systems acquisitions used million  as well as the final payment of million from our acquisition of omega 
we also made normal capital expenditures of million and purchased short term investments totaling million in in our acquisition of omega used cash of million  net of cash acquired 
we made capital expenditures of million in  partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of our interest in a joint venture 
we also liquidated million of short term investments in early  thereby avoiding much of the turmoil in the credit markets that occurred later in that year 
financing activities in included scheduled payments on long term borrowings of million and the payment of a dividend to shareholders of million cents per share 
similarly  in and financing activities included payments on long term borrowings of million and million  respectively  and both years included payments of dividends to shareholders of million cents per share 
the accumulated deficit in other comprehensive income loss decreased million in due to a positive adjustment from foreign currency translation of million and an unrealized gain on cash flow hedges of million 
partially offsetting these positive adjustments was an increase in the recorded liability for our pension plans of million after applicable income taxes 
these adjustments resulted in a negative balance in accumulated other comprehensive income of million at september  compared to a negative balance of million at september  the pension plan unfunded balance increased from the september  balance of million to million at september  this decrease in the funded position can be attributed primarily to a decrease in the discount rate we used to calculate the pension liability 
the net deferred tax asset increased to million at september  compared to million at september  the increase included the effect of recording adjustments to the pension liability through other comprehensive income  which resulted in an additional deferred tax asset of million at september  we expect to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
our financial condition remains strong with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september  we expect that cash on hand and our ability to access the debt markets will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to a short term borrowing arrangement we have in new zealand  we have a committed three year credit facility from a group of financial institutions in the us  aggregating million 
this agreement will expire in december as of september   million of this capacity was used for letters of credit  leaving an additional million available 
our total debt to capital ratio at september  was 
in addition  our cash and short term investments totaled million at september  which exceeded our total long term debt by million 
our cash is invested primarily in highly liquid government treasury and other agency instruments in the u 
s 
and europe 
the following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding as of september  total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt interest payments operating leases deferred compensation critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the estimates set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting estimates and represent the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe our judgments related to these accounting estimates are appropriate 
however  if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally  we record revenue for long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
many of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver minimal quantities over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
for certain other long term  fixed price production contracts not requiring substantial development effort we use the units of delivery percentage completion method as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
as a general rule  we recognize sales and profits earlier in a production cycle when we use the cost to cost method of percentage of completion accounting than when we use the units of delivery method 
in addition  our profits and margins may vary materially depending on the types of long term contracts undertaken  the costs incurred in their performance  the achievement of other performance objectives  and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees  particularly under award and incentive fee contracts  is finally determined 
award fees and incentives related to performance on contracts  which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer  as well as penalties related to contract performance  are considered in estimating sales and profit rates 
estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs 
those incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance 
accounting for long term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract revenues and costs  and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
due to the scope and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts  the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
contract costs include material  labor  and subcontracting costs  as well as an allocation of indirect costs 
we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability  the complexity of the work to be performed  the availability of materials  estimated increases in wages and prices for materials  performance by our subcontractors  and the availability and timing of funding from our customer  among other variables 
for contract change orders  claims  or similar items  we apply judgment in estimating the amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
we have accounting policies in place to address these  as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long term contracts 
products and services provided under long term  fixed price contracts represented approximately of our net sales for because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes  it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change 
for example  if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed price contracts was higher or lower by one percentage point  our net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
when adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required  any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception to date effect of the changes on current and prior periods 
when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned  a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined 
we occasionally enter into contracts  primarily in our transportation systems business  that include multiple deliverables such as the construction or upgrade of a system and subsequent services related to the delivered system 
historically  these contracts have not been common in our business  however  recently we have seen an increase in the number of customer requests for proposal that include this type of contractual arrangement 
an example of this is a contract we entered into in to provide system upgrades and long term services for the sydney  australia electronic ticketing system 
we elected to adopt updated authoritative accounting guidance for multiple element arrangements in on a prospective basis 
for contracts of this nature entered into in and beyond  the contract value is allocated at the inception of the contract to the different contract elements based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists  we use our best estimate of the selling price for each deliverable 
once the contract value is allocated to the separate deliverables  revenue recognition guidance relevant to each contractual element is followed 
for example  for the long term construction portion of a contract we use the percentage completion method and for the services portion we recognize the service revenues on a straight line basis over the contractual service period or based on measurable units of work performed or incentives earned 
the judgment we apply in allocating the relative selling price to each deliverable can have a significant impact on the timing of recognizing revenues and operating income on a contract 
revenue under contracts for services other than those associated with design  development  or production activities is recognized either as services are performed or when a contractually required event has occurred  depending on the contract 
the majority of our services contracts are in our mss and cts segments  services contracts primarily include outsourcing type arrangements and operations and maintenance contracts 
revenue under such contracts is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the period of contract performance  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or the obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
costs incurred under these services contracts are expensed as incurred  earnings related to services contracts may fluctuate from period to period  particularly in the earlier phases of the contract 
award fees and incentives related to performance on services contracts at mss are generally accrued during the performance of the contract based on our historical experience with such awards 
incentive fees included in some of our transportation systems service contracts are recognized when they become fixed and determinable based on the provisions of the contract 
often these fees are based on meeting certain contractually required service levels or based on system usage levels 
more than half of our total sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the us government 
cost based pricing is determined under the federal acquisition regulation far 
the far provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under us government contracts 
for example  costs such as those related to charitable contributions  interest expense  and certain advertising activities are unallowable  and therefore not recoverable through sales 
we closely monitor compliance with  and the consistent application of  our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting 
business segment personnel evaluate our contracts through periodic contract status and performance reviews 
corporate management and our internal auditors also monitor compliance with our revenue recognition policies and review contract status with segment personnel 
costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with us government regulations by our personnel  and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
for other information on accounting policies we have in place for recognizing sales and profits  see our discussion under revenue recognition in note to the financial statements 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax return positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe it is more likely than not a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  if examined  would be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements and are referred to as timing differences 
in addition  some expenses are not deductible on our tax return and are referred to as permanent differences 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions we have taken on our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the us for the foreseeable future 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  annually we evaluate the capital requirements in our foreign subsidiaries and determine the amount of excess capital  if any  that is available for distribution 
whether or not we actually repatriate the excess capital in the form of a dividend  we would provide for us taxes on the amount determined to be available for distribution 
this evaluation is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amount of us taxes provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is affected by these judgments 
purchased intangibles we generally fund acquisitions using cash on hand 
the purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition day  with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill 
we amortize intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations over their estimated useful lives unless their useful lives are determined to be indefinite 
for certain business combinations  we utilize independent valuations to assist us in recording purchased intangibles 
our purchased intangibles primarily relate to contracts and programs acquired and customer relationships  which are amortized over periods of years or less 
the determination of the value and useful life of purchased intangibles is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amount of annual amortization expense we record is affected by these judgments 
for example  if the weighted average amortization period for our purchased intangibles was one year less than we have determined  our net earnings would have decreased by approximately million 
valuation of goodwill we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
our annual testing date is june we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
to date there has been no impairment of our recorded goodwill 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows september  in millions mission support services defense systems transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparisons with recent transactions and market multiples from publically traded comparable companies 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
for fiscal  the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete three year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the three year discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios  influenced by an analysis of historical ratios  and by calculating a terminal value at the end of five years for our defense segments  and three years for our transportation segment 
the annual growth rates for sales ranged from to and for operating profit margins ranged from to for the reporting units  beyond the discrete forecast period 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of for our defense segments  and for our transportation segment 
the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of the carrying value and  accordingly  there was no indicator that goodwill was impaired as of june  changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  the fair value of our reporting units would remain in excess of their respective carrying values even if there were a decrease in their fair value st june  pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on high quality corporate long term bonds 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the views of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
mortality rates are based on published mortality tables 
retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
changes in the above assumptions can affect our financial statements  although the relatively small size of our defined benefit pension plans limits the impact any individual assumption changes can have on earnings 
for example  if the assumed rate of return on pension assets was basis points higher or lower than we have determined  our net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt securities whose return is tied to short term interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the us and new zealand which are also tied to short term rates the us prime rate and the new zealand base rate 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  the us  australia and new zealand 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us and new zealand 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we have in the past  and may in the future  use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap would be to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
there was no interest rate swap outstanding at september  foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  singapore dollar  euro  swedish krona  new zealand dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change  because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we do not believe that we are significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand  and canada are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation  if any  and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
