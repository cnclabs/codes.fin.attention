item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that include numerous risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of these risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in this annual report on form k under special note regarding forward looking statements and under risk factors 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected financial data and the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of international coal group  inc and its subsidiaries appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents overview we produce  process and sell coal from regional mining complexes  which  as of december  were supported by active underground mines  active surface mines and preparation plants located throughout west virginia  kentucky  virginia  maryland and illinois 
we have three reportable business segments  which are based on the coal regions in which we operate i central appalachian  comprised of both surface and underground mines  ii northern appalachian  also comprised of both surface and underground mines and iii illinois basin  representing one underground mine 
for more information about our reportable business segments  please see our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
we also broker coal produced by others  the majority of which is shipped directly from the third party producer to the ultimate customer 
our coal sales are primarily to large utilities and industrial customers in the eastern region of the united states and domestic and international steel companies and brokers 
in addition  we generate other revenues from the manufacture and operation of highwall mining systems  parts sales and shop services relating to those systems and coal handling and processing fees 
our primary expenses are wages and benefits  repair and maintenance expenditures  diesel fuel purchases  blasting supplies  coal transportation costs  cost of purchased coal  royalties  freight and handling costs and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
certain trends and economic factors affecting the coal industry our revenues depend on the price at which we are able to sell our coal 
the pricing environment for domestic steam and metallurgical coal during weakened from the relatively strong pricing experienced throughout much of near the end of and continuing into  coal prices dropped drastically due to decreased demand for metallurgical coal caused by the global economic crisis and decreased demand for steam coal caused by high inventory levels at utilities 
accordingly  we have experienced decreased costs for commodities  such as fuel  explosives and steel products 
we did  however  see an increase in our labor and healthcare costs as a result of wage increases given in late in an effort to remain competitive in what had been a tight labor market and an increase in medical benefits over the prior year 
while compensation related costs increased over  we expect that current economic conditions will reduce the inflationary pressures that drove up such costs in recent years 
conversely  we expect to experience higher costs for surety bonds and letters of credit resulting from more stringent regulatory requirements 
for additional information regarding some of the risks and uncertainties that affect our business and the industry in which we operate  see item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates used 
our actual results have generally not differed materially from our estimates 
however  we monitor such differences and  in the event that actual results are significantly different from those estimated  we disclose any related impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k provides a description of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that of these significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
table of contents revenue recognition coal revenues result from sales contracts long term coal agreements or purchase orders with electric utilities  industrial companies or other coal related organizations  primarily in the eastern united states 
revenue is recognized and recorded when shipment or delivery to the customer has occurred  prices are fixed or determinable and the title or risk of loss has passed in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
under the typical terms of these agreements  risk of loss transfers to the customers at the mine or port  when the coal is loaded on the rail  barge  truck or other transportation sources that deliver coal to its destination 
coal sales revenues also result from the sale of brokered coal produced by others 
the revenues related to brokered coal sales are included in coal sales revenues on a gross basis and the corresponding cost of the coal from the supplier is recorded in cost of coal sales in accordance with asc subtopic  principal agent considerations asc freight and handling costs paid to third party carriers and invoiced to coal customers are recorded as freight and handling costs and freight and handling revenues  respectively 
other revenues primarily consist of contract mining income  coalbed methane sales  ash disposal services  equipment and parts sales  equipment rebuild and maintenance services  royalties and coal handling and processing income 
with respect to other revenues recognized in situations unrelated to the shipment of coal  we carefully review the facts and circumstances of each transaction and do not recognize revenue until the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
advance payments received are deferred and recognized in revenue when earned 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we establish provisions for losses on accounts receivable when it is probable that all or part of the outstanding balance will not be collected 
management regularly reviews collectability and establishes or adjusts the allowance as necessary 
although we believe the estimate of credit losses we have made is reasonable and appropriate  inability to collect outstanding accounts receivable amounts could materially impact our reported financial results 
reclamation our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
we record these reclamation obligations according to the provisions of asc topic  asset retirement and environmental obligations asc 
asc requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which the legal obligation associated with the retirement of the long lived asset is incurred 
fair value of reclamation liabilities is determined based on the present value of the estimated future expenditures 
when the liability is initially recorded  the offset is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
if the assumptions used to estimate the liability do not materialize as expected or regulatory changes were to occur  reclamation costs or obligations to perform reclamation and mine closure activities could be materially different than currently estimated 
to settle the liability  the mine property is reclaimed and  to the extent there is a difference between the liability and the amount of cash paid to perform the reclamation  a gain or loss upon settlement is recognized 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions to reflect current experience 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current liabilities 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closure is approximately million 

table of contents advance royalties we are required  under certain royalty lease agreements  to make minimum royalty payments whether or not mining activity is being performed on the leased property 
these minimum payments may be recoupable once mining begins on the leased property 
the recoupable minimum royalty payments are capitalized and amortized based on the units of production method at a rate defined in the lease agreement once mining activities begin 
unamortized deferred royalty costs are expensed when mining has ceased or a decision is made not to mine on such property 
we have recorded an allowance for such circumstances based upon management s plans for the continuing operation of existing mine sites or for when properties will be developed and or mined 
we believe the estimate for losses is appropriate 
however  actual amounts that we recoup through mining activity could vary resulting in a material impact to our financial results 
inventories coal inventories are stated at lower of average cost or market and represent coal contained in stockpiles  including those tons that have been mined and hauled to our loadout facilities  but not yet shipped to customers 
these inventories are stated in clean coal equivalent tons and take into account any loss that may occur during the processing stage 
coal must be of a quality that can be sold on existing sales orders to be carried as coal inventory 
coal inventory volumes are determined through survey procedures 
the surveys involve assumptions  inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
parts and supplies inventories are valued at average cost  less an allowance for obsolescence 
we establish provisions for losses in parts and supplies inventory values through analysis of turnover of inventory items and adjust the allowance as necessary 
although we believe the estimates we have made with respect to the valuation of our coal and parts and supplies inventories are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions coal inventories or actual utilization of items parts and supplies inventories could materially impact our reported financial results 
depreciation  depletion and amortization property  plant  equipment and mine development  which includes coal lands and mineral rights  are recorded at cost  which includes construction overhead and interest  where applicable 
expenditures for major renewals and betterments are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
mine development  coal lands and mineral rights costs are amortized using the units of production method  based on estimated recoverable tons 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of recoverable tons related to particular mine development  coal lands and mineral rights areas 
recoverable tons contained in an area are based on engineering estimates which can  and often do  change as the tons are mined 
any change in the number of recoverable tons contained in mine development  coal lands and mineral rights areas will result in a change in the depletion rate and corresponding depletion expense 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of depletion expense 
other property  plant and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives 

table of contents coal reserves there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists 
reserve estimates are periodically updated to reflect past coal production  new drilling information and other geologic or mining data 
acquisitions  sales or dispositions of coal properties will also change the amount of economically recoverable coal reserves 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and the classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to these reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
at december   we estimate that we had billion tons of coal reserves 
asset impairments we follow asc subtopic  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires that projected future cash flows from use and disposition of assets be compared with the carrying amounts of those assets when impairment indicators are present 
when the sum of projected cash flows is less than the carrying amount  impairment losses are indicated 
if the fair value of the assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recognized 
in determining such impairment losses  discounted cash flows or asset appraisals are utilized to determine the fair value of the assets being evaluated 
also  in certain situations  expected mine lives are shortened because of changes to planned operations 
when that occurs and it is determined that the mine s underlying costs are not recoverable in the future  reclamation and mine closure obligations are accelerated and the mine closure accrual is increased accordingly 
to the extent it is determined asset carrying values will not be recoverable during a shorter mine life  a provision for such impairment is recognized 
recognition of an impairment will decrease asset values  increase operating expenses and decrease net income 
in december  we made the decision to permanently close our sago mine during the first quarter of upon making this decision  we performed an impairment test of related mine development costs  which resulted in a million non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their estimated fair value 
there were no other impairment charges related to long lived assets recognized in the periods covered by this annual report on form k as a result of our impairment tests 
financial instruments pursuant to asc subtopic  transition related to fasb staff position apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement asc  our convertible notes are accounted for as convertible debt and the embedded conversion option in the convertible notes has been accounted for as a component of equity 

table of contents coal supply agreements our below market coal supply agreements sales contracts represent coal supply agreements acquired through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for which the prevailing market price for coal specified in the contract was in excess of the contract price 
in accordance with asc topic  business combinations  value was based on discounted cash flows resulting from the difference between the below market contract price and the prevailing market price at the date of acquisition 
the below market coal supply agreements are amortized on the basis of tons shipped over the term of the respective contract 
determination of fair value requires management s judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
share based compensation we account for our share based awards in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc 
share based compensation expense is generally measured at the grant date and recognized as expense over the vesting period of the award 
we utilize restricted stock and stock options as part of our share based compensation program 
determining fair value requires us to make a number of assumptions  including expected term  risk free rate and expected volatility 
due to our limited operating history  the expected term and volatility are estimated based on other companies in the coal industry 
the risk free interest rates are based on the rates of zero coupon us treasury bonds with similar maturities on the date of grant 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
debt issuance costs debt issuance costs reflect fees incurred to obtain financing 
debt issuance costs related to our outstanding debt are amortized over the life of the related debt 
from time to time  we write off deferred financing fees as a result of amending or canceling related debt and or credit agreements 
such write offs could be material and occur in the period that the amendment or cancellation occurs 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes asc  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets  if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  be reduced by a valuation allowance 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the timing of the realization of deferred tax liabilities  the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if future taxable income is lower than expected or if expected tax planning strategies are not available as anticipated  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made 
a tax position is initially recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by applicable tax authorities 
such tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
the amount of our uncertain income tax positions  unrecognized benefits and accrued interest were immaterial at december  and 
table of contents postretirement medical benefits some of our subsidiaries have liabilities for postretirement benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
liabilities for postretirement benefits are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined and we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and future cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits 
the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts using a rate of as of december  we make assumptions related to future trends for medical care costs in the estimates of retiree healthcare and work related injury and illness obligations 
the future healthcare cost trend rate represents the rate at which healthcare costs are expected to increase over the life of the plan 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are determined primarily based upon our  and our predecessor s  historical rate of change in retiree healthcare costs 
the postretirement expense in the operating period ended december  was based on an assumed heath care inflationary rate of in the operating period decreasing to in  which represents the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate for the remainder of the plan life 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed ultimate healthcare cost trend rate would increase the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december  by million and increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed ultimate healthcare cost trend rate would decrease the service and interest cost components of the postretirement benefit expense for the year ended december  by million and decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at december  by million 
if our assumptions do not materialize as expected or if regulatory changes were to occur  actual cash expenditures and costs that we incur could differ materially from our current estimates 
workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs and  on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment or the beneficiary of an employee that suffers fatal injuries in the course of employment 
our operations are covered through a combination of participation in a state run program and insurance policies 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts using a discount rate of as of december  the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our workers compensation liability would increase by approximately million 
if we were to increase our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our workers compensation liability would decrease by approximately million 
at december   we have recorded an accrual of million for workers compensation benefits 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 

table of contents coal workers pneumoconiosis we are responsible under various federal statutes  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible employees resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
our operations are covered through a combination of participation in a state run program and insurance policies 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts using a discount rate of as of december  the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our black lung benefit liability would increase by approximately million 
if we were to increase our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our black lung benefit liability would decrease by approximately million 
at december   we have recorded an accrual of million for black lung benefits 
individual losses in excess of million at the state level and million at the federal level are covered by our large deductible stop loss insurance 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act provides for the funding of health benefits for certain union retirees and their spouses or dependants 
the coal act established the combined fund into which employers who are signatory operators and related persons are obligated to pay annual premiums for beneficiaries 
the coal act also created a second benefit fund for miners who retired between july  and september  and whose former employers are no longer in business 
upon the consummation of the business combination with anker  we assumed anker s coal act liabilities  which were estimated to be million at december  actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarially determined amounts using a discount rate of as of december  the discount rate assumption reflects the rates available on a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
if we were to decrease our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our coal act liability would increase by approximately million 
if we were to increase our estimate of the discount rate to  the present value of our coal act liability would decrease by approximately million 
prior to the business combination with anker  we did not have any liability under the coal act 
corporate vacation policy during  we changed our policy related to when employees are credited with vacation time 
under the original policy  employees earned their vacation in the year prior to vesting  and were vested with of their annual vacation time on january st of each year 
under the revised policy  employees are vested in their vacation time ratably throughout the year as it is earned 
accordingly  we did not record accruals in for vacation time to be vested in if we continued to account for vacation under the old policy  we would have recognized additional cost of coal sales  cost of other revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses of million  million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  
table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues  coal sales revenues by reportable segment and tons sold by reportable segment the following table depicts consolidated revenues for the years ended december  and for the indicated categories year ended december  increase decrease or tons in thousands  except percentages and per ton data coal sales revenues freight and handling revenues other revenues total revenues tons sold coal sales revenue per ton the following table depicts coal sales revenues by reportable segment for years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total coal sales revenues the following table depicts tons sold by reportable segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease tons in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total tons sold coal sales revenues coal sales revenues are derived from sales of produced coal and brokered coal contracts 
coal sales revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in sales realization per ton resulting from favorable pricing on sales contracts entered into throughout partially offsetting the impact of the improved realization per ton was an decrease in tons sold  primarily resulting from decreased participation in the spot market 

table of contents central appalachian 
coal sales revenues from our central appalachian segment for the year ended december  increased over the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in sales realization of per ton  which was driven by higher average contract prices of our coal 
partially offsetting the increase in realization was a decrease in tons sold  largely driven by decreased spot market sales 
northern appalachian 
for the year ended december   our northern appalachian coal sales revenues decreased over the same period in due to a decrease in tons sold  primarily due to reduced spot market sales 
partially offsetting the decrease in tons sold was an increase in sales realization of per ton resulting from higher average prices of coal sold under our coal supply contracts 
illinois basin 
the increase in coal sales revenues from our illinois basin segment for the year ended december  was due to an increase in sales realization of per ton  partially offset by a decrease in tons sold 
ancillary 
our ancillary segment s coal sales revenues are comprised of coal sold under brokered coal contracts 
for the year ended december   our ancillary coal sales revenues decreased due to a decrease in tons sold related to the expiration of certain coal supply agreements  as well as to decreased shipments on various remaining contracts 
this decrease in tons sold was partially offset by an increase in sales realization of per ton sold 
freight and handling revenues and costs freight and handling revenues represent reimbursement of freight and handling costs for certain shipments for which we initially pay the costs and are then reimbursed by the customer 
freight and handling revenues and costs decreased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes 
additionally  transportation rates and fuel surcharges have been reduced as a result of decreased fuel prices 
other revenues the increase in other revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to million in payments received for the early termination of coal supply agreements and the lost margin on pre termination shipments and a million non cash gain on the termination of a below market contract  as well as a sale of a highwall mining system during the year ended december  partially offsetting these increases were decreases in coalbed methane revenue  contract mining income and sales of scrap materials

partially offsetting the decrease in tons sold was a increase in cost per ton 
central appalachian 
our central appalachian segment cost of coal sales decreased primarily as a result of a decrease in tons sold 
the decrease in cost of coal sales is due to decreased tons sold partially offset by an increase in costs to per ton for the year ended december  from per ton for the year ended december  the increase in cost of coal sales per ton is primarily due to increases in labor and benefit costs and royalties  taxes and fees 
labor and benefit costs per ton increased due to wage increases in the fourth quarter of in an effort to remain competitive in a tight labor market  lower production volumes associated with idled operations and an increase in medical benefits over the year ended december  royalties  taxes and fees increased on a per ton basis as a result of increased sales realization per ton sold and increased royalty rates on certain leased reserves  as well as increased severance and property tax obligations 
northern appalachian 
cost of coal sales from our northern appalachian segment decreased for the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in costs of per ton and a decrease in tons sold compared to the year ended december  the decrease in cost per ton is primarily due to decreases in transportation  fuel  lubricants and chemicals and coal purchased for blending to meet customer specifications 
partially offsetting these decreases in cost per ton were increases in labor and benefits  reclamation and engineering costs and contract labor costs 
illinois basin 
for the year ended december   our illinois basin cost of coal sales increased as a result of an increase in costs of per ton primarily due to increased labor and benefits costs and repairs and maintenance costs 
labor and benefits increased subsequent to the year ended december as a result of increased wages in an effort to retain skilled miners 
additionally  repairs and maintenance costs were higher due to our increased utilization of underground mining equipment 
partially offsetting these increases in cost per ton was a decrease in tons sold 
ancillary 
cost of coal sales from our ancillary segment decreased for the year ended december  primarily due to decreased purchased coal costs related to the expiration of certain brokered coal contracts  as well as to decreased shipments on various remaining contracts in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase of per ton sold  primarily as a result of increased reclamation and property tax expense at certain non operating locations 

table of contents cost of other revenues for the year ended december   cost of other revenues increased primarily due to the related costs of the highwall mining system sold during the year and increased labor and benefit costs at our addcar subsidiary 
partially offsetting these increases in cost of other revenues were decreases in coalbed methane gathering fees  repairs and maintenance costs and water treatment costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased for the year ended december   primarily as a result of capital spending throughout and further impacting the increase was increased depletion expense resulting from increased mining of company owned reserves  as well as a decrease in amortization income related to the completion or termination of shipments on certain below market contracts 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in amortization of coalbed methane well development costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  decreased primarily due to the recovery of a potential bad debt and the favorable resolution of certain legal and tax matters 
gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets decreased significantly for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized a million pre tax gain on exchange of coal reserves with a third party and a million gain related to the sale of a highwall mining system previously used in operations 
these decreases were partially offset by a gain of million in related to the sale of a loadout facility 
impairment loss the impairment loss reflects the write off of goodwill in associated with our addcar subsidiary as a result of the negative impact of several contributing factors  which resulted in a reduction in the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value 
additionally  as a result of making the decision to close the sago mine  related development costs were deemed to be impaired and were written off during no comparable impairment occurred during 
table of contents adjusted ebitda by reportable segment adjusted ebitda represents net income before deducting interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  loss on extinguishment of debt  impairment charges and noncontrolling interest 
adjusted ebitda is presented because it is an important supplemental measure of our performance used by our chief operating decision maker in such areas as capital investment and allocation of resources 
other companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is reconciled to its most comparable gaap measure on page of this annual report on form k and in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the following table depicts reportable segment adjusted ebitda for the years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease in thousands  except percentages central appalachian northern appalachian illinois basin ancillary total adjusted ebitda central appalachian 
adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  primarily due to million received for the early termination of two related coal supply agreements and lost margin on pre termination shipments coupled with a per ton increase in profit margins 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease of approximately  tons sold 
northern appalachian 
the increase in adjusted ebitda was due to improved profit margins of per ton attributable to a combination of an increase in sales realization of per ton and a decrease of in cost per ton 
illinois basin 
adjusted ebitda decreased during the year ended december  due to a decrease of approximately  tons sold 
partially offsetting this decrease in tons sold were increased profit margins of per ton 
ancillary 
the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily due to million received for contract settlements and an increase in profit margins of per ton due to an increase in sales realization of per ton  offset by a increase in cost per ton 
further contributing to the increase in adjusted ebitda from our ancillary segment was the sale of a highwall mining system during the year ended december   offset by decreased revenue from coalbed methane wells and a decrease of approximately  tons sold related to the expiration of brokered coal contracts throughout and decreased shipments of various remaining contracts

coal sales revenues increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to a increase in sales realization per ton resulting from increased spot market and short term contract sales entered into in order to capitalize on favorable market conditions during the first three quarters of further impacting the increase in coal sales revenue was a increase in tons sold compared to the same period of partially offsetting the impact of improved realization per ton and the increase in tons sold was a decrease in coal sales revenues attributable to the expiration of certain brokered coal contracts 
central appalachian 
coal sales revenues from our central appalachian segment for the year ended december  increased over the same period in primarily due to an increase of per ton  which was driven by higher average prices of our coal sold pursuant to short term supply agreements and on the spot market  including increased sales of metallurgical coal  primarily from increased production at our new beckley operation 
northern appalachian 
for the year ended december   our northern appalachian coal sales revenues increased due to an increase of per ton resulting from higher average prices of coal sold pursuant to coal supply agreements and from an increase in sales of metallurgical coal  particularly on the spot market which provided advantageous pricing throughout much of additionally  we experienced an increase in tons sold at certain of our complexes

no liabilities related to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
federal and state laws require us to secure payment of certain long term obligations  such as mine closure and reclamation costs  coal leases and other obligations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
in may  we entered into an interest rate collar agreement  which became effective on march  and expired and was settled on march   to hedge our interest risk on million notional amount of revolving debt 
the interest rate collar was designed as a cash flow hedge to offset the impact of changes in the libor interest rate above and below 
this agreement was entered into in conjunction with our amended and restated credit facility dated june  we recognized the changes in the fair value of this agreement in the income statement in the period of change 
for the year ended december   we recognized an immaterial loss related to changes in fair market value 
market price risk 
we are exposed to market price risk in the normal course of mining and selling coal 
we manage this risk through the use of long term coal supply agreements  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
as of december   of our projected sales are committed and priced 
any committed and unpriced projected sales are subject to future market price volatility 
additionally  the prices of coal shipped under long term supply agreements may be below the current market prices for similar types of coal at any given time 
as a result of the substantial volume of sales that are subject to these long term agreements  we have less coal available with which to capitalize on stronger coal prices if and when they arise
