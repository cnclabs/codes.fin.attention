item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review for the th consecutive year  the company reported a net profit  earning million 
per share  diluted in  as compared to net profit of million 
per share  diluted 
although the company s results were unfavorable compared to its results and to its historical profitability standards  the company believes the achievement of a profit in was a tremendous accomplishment given the enormity of challenges faced by the airline industry during the year 
the year began amidst the backdrop of an unprecedented worldwide credit crisis and a significant economic recession 
although fuel prices were lower on average than in  prices remained much higher than long term historical averages  which forced all airlines to make major adjustments to their operations and business models 
the company s response included initiatives designed to increase unit revenues including an overall reduction in capacity and elimination of unprofitable flights  targeted marketing campaigns to enhance the company s already strong brand and customer experience  improved revenue management processes  and new service offerings such as earlybird check in and the company s pets are welcome on southwest paws products 
the company also introduced initiatives to reduce costs  including right sizing headcount 
as a result of prevailing economic conditions in the second half of  which persisted throughout  most us commercial air carriers significantly reduced domestic capacity in an attempt to match the level of anticipated demand 
this included the company  which retired older aircraft  postponed deliveries of new aircraft  and modified its operations  resulting in a percent reduction in available seat miles flown in versus however  the company was able to stimulate a significant amount of demand through fare sales  through its bags fly free advertising campaign  and through optimizing its flight schedule 
these efforts produced a significant improvement in load factors and unit revenue trends during the second half of the year 
in the first half of  the company had monthly unit revenue trends that approached year over year declines of up to ten percent 
by the end of  however  the company was experiencing moderate improvements in unit revenues compared to  including a fourth quarter year over year improvement of almost seven percent  which outperformed the industry 
the company attributes a significant portion of this improvement to several key initiatives  including its decision to not charge for a customer s first or second checked bag  as nearly all other domestic carriers have done  a new and improved website at southwest 
com  significant advancements in the company s revenue management and network optimization capabilities  which include trimming unproductive and less popular flights and reallocating capacity to fund other market growth opportunities  such as minneapolis st 
paul  new york laguardia  boston logan  and milwaukee  all of which were new destinations for the company in  new products such as earlybird and paws  and aggressive discounting of fares  which stimulated demand and resulted in company record load factors in every month from july through december on the cost front  lower fuel expense almost exactly offset the reduction in revenues experienced by the company during however  fuel prices began the year at much lower levels than they were at the end of the market price of spot crude oil hit a low of per barrel during first quarter  but rose throughout the year to hit a high of per barrel during fourth quarter the company also executed freedom during the year  which was a voluntary early retirement program that was accepted by  employees 
this resulted in a one time charge of million before the impact of profitsharing or taxes during the program was offered to decrease overstaffing created by the company s prior decision to reduce its capacity during  and the company currently expects savings in subsequent years to exceed the cost of the program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company carefully managed its fleet during and ended the year with aircraft in active service the same with which it started the year 
a total of new boeing s were delivered to the company during  and the company removed older s from active service 

table of contents looking ahead to  the company remains cautious about demand for domestic air travel given current domestic economic conditions 
although unit revenue trends have improved recently  this improvement primarily has been through capacity reductions and other revenue initiatives  and the company has not experienced a significant increase in the demand for full fare tickets 
in addition  fuel prices continue to be volatile and remain much higher than long term historical averages 
in october  the company announced its decision to begin service from northwest florida beaches international airport near panama city  florida in may this will represent the company s th destination  and it believes it will continue to have opportunities to add more new cities in the future 
the company also plans to continue efforts to implement its previously announced codeshare agreements with two different airlines canadian carrier westjet and mexican carrier volaris 
flight schedules and additional features regarding these relationships are expected to be announced in however  certain details of these alliances are subject to approvals by both the us and canadian mexican governments 
the company currently anticipates another year of little or no change in its overall fleet size for the company anticipates it will receive ten new deliveries from boeing during and currently plans to retire a similar number of older s  resulting in approximately flat asms compared to however  if there is a significant improvement in demand which includes the return of full fare traffic  the company believes it has the flexibility to alter its current plans and to resume growth 
results of operations compared with the company s net income of million 
per share  diluted in represented a decrease of million  or percent  compared to its net income of million 
per share  diluted 
the results in each year were significantly impacted by the company s fuel hedge program and the accounting requirements related to the derivative instruments used in the company s hedging activities 
as a result of the fuel hedges the company had in place during including those that settled during and those that will settle in future years the company recognized a net total of million in losses allocated between fuel and oil expense and other gains losses  net  in the consolidated statement of income 
during  the company had recognized a total of billion in net gains as a result of its fuel hedging activities  allocated between fuel and oil expense and other gains losses  net 
each of these totals for and includes the net premium costs the company paid to enter into a portion of its fuel derivative instruments such as option contracts which is classified as a component of other gains losses  net 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fuel derivative instruments 
due to the fact that the company s fuel hedging activities have resulted in large noncash adjustments to other gains losses  net  the company believes operating income provides a better indication of the company s financial performance for both and than does net income 
the company s operating income was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to although the fluctuations in passenger revenue and fuel and oil expense in versus were the largest individual components impacting operating income  the year over year decline in passenger revenues almost exactly offset the year over year decline in fuel and oil expense 
excluding these two components  the majority of the million decline in operating income for versus was due to an increase in salaries  wages  and benefits 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a million  or percent  decrease in passenger revenues 
the majority of the decline in passenger revenues was attributable to a percent decrease in passenger revenue yields passenger revenues divided by revenue passenger miles or rpms  as the percentage of full fare bookings was down versus the prior year and the company offered more fare sales and discounted seats in response to the decline in demand for air travel amid domestic economic conditions 
however  as a result of the company s fare discounting efforts and a number of recently implemented revenue initiatives  combined with a percent reduction in asms  load factor increased points to percent in  which was a record for the company 
the higher load factor mostly offset the decline in passenger yield  resulting in only a net percent decline in operating revenue yield per asm unit revenue versus 
table of contents the recent revenue initiatives implemented by the company have enabled it to partially offset the loss of full fare traffic versus the prior year and thus minimize the year over year decline in unit revenues 
during  the company launched a new and improved website at southwest 
com  introduced earlybird check in  which allows customers to pay to automatically get an assigned boarding position before general check in begins  introduced new fees for unaccompanied minors and for pets  and continued to optimize its schedule and tout its bags fly free campaign 
the company believes these and other planned programs and processes will create substantial opportunities for future revenue growth 
based on results thus far in january and current booking trends for the remainder of the quarter  the company expects a year over year increase in unit revenues for first quarter consolidated freight revenues decreased million  or percent  versus this decrease primarily was due to fewer shipments as a result of the recent worldwide recession 
this prevented the company from being able to increase its shipping rates during during the majority of  better economic conditions enabled the company to increase its shipping rates when fuel prices were rising 
the company currently expects a slight increase in consolidated freight revenues during first quarter versus first quarter  primarily due to an anticipated increase in shipments 
other revenues increased million  or percent  compared to the majority of the increase was due to revenues from recent initiatives  such as recently implemented fees for unaccompanied minors and for pets  revenue from the company s earlybird initiative  and an increase in the fee charged for customers checking a third bag 
the company expects other revenues for first quarter to also exceed first quarter  due to these recently implemented revenue initiatives 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for decreased million  or percent  compared to a percent decrease in capacity 
historically  except for changes in the price of fuel  changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity  or asms 
the following presents the company s operating expenses per asm for and followed by explanations of these changes on a per asm basis and or on a dollar basis in cents  except for percentages increase decrease percent change salaries  wages  and benefits fuel and oil maintenance materials and repairs aircraft rentals landing fees and other rentals depreciation and amortization other total the company s casm cost per available seat mile was up slightly from  increasing by a net

however  operating expense included the impact of freedom  the early retirement plan offered by the company  which resulted in a million charge recorded during third quarter excluding the impact of this charge  casm was flat compared to as lower fuel costs were offset by higher airport costs and by higher wage rates paid to nearly all employee groups 
based on current cost trends and an estimated five to six percent decline in first quarter year over year capacity  the company anticipates first quarter unit costs  excluding fuel  to exceed fourth quarter s unit cost of cents and is expecting the year over year increase to exceed the percent year over year increase the company experienced in fourth quarter salaries  wages  and benefits increased million on an absolute dollar basis  including the million charge recorded during third quarter as a result of freedom  the early retirement plan offered by the company that was accepted by  employees 
excluding the impact of the freedom charge  the majority 
table of contents of the year over year increase was from higher salaries and wages  primarily as a result of higher average wage rates 
this was partially offset by a million decrease in profitsharing  attributable to lower income available for profitsharing 
the company s profitsharing expense excludes the unrealized gains and or losses the company records in its fuel hedging program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fuel hedging 
salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm was percent higher than  primarily due to the fact that the company s unionized workforce  who make up the majority of its employees  had pay scale increases as a result of increased seniority  while the company s asm capacity declined percent compared to based on current cost trends and headwinds from lower capacity  the company expects salaries  wages  and benefits per asm in first quarter to be higher than fourth quarter s unit cost of cents 
the company s stock clerks are subject to an agreement between the company and the international brotherhood of teamsters  local ibt local 
this agreement became amendable in august the company and ibt local reached a tentative agreement on behalf of the southwest stock clerks in fourth quarter  which will be voted on during the company s aircraft appearance technicians and dispatchers are subject to agreements between the company and the aircraft mechanics fraternal association amfa and the company and the transportation workers of america  afl cio  local twu  which became amendable in february and november  respectively 
the company is currently in discussions on new agreements with both amfa and twu fuel and oil expense decreased million  or percent  and on a per asm basis decreased percent versus both the dollar and the per asm decrease were driven primarily by a percent decrease in the average price per gallon for jet fuel  including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging  and including related taxes 
as a result of the company s fuel hedging program and inclusive of the impact of the accounting requirements for derivatives and hedging  the company recognized net losses totaling million in in fuel and oil expense relating to fuel derivative instruments versus billion of net gains recognized in fuel and oil expense in these totals are inclusive of cash settlements realized from the expiration settlement of fuel derivatives  which were million paid to counterparties in versus billion received from counterparties for additionally  in and  there were net losses recognized in fuel and oil expense  of million and million  respectively  due to the fact that the company had previously recognized gains associated with settling contracts in each period that were associated with ineffective hedges or derivatives that did not qualify for special hedge accounting 
however  these totals exclude gains and or losses recognized from hedge ineffectiveness  which are recorded as a component of other gains losses  net 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the company also continued to make progress in improving the fuel efficiency of its fleet 
despite the large increase in load factor from to  the company was able to produce the same fuel gallons consumed per asm flown for each year 
as of december   the company had fuel derivative instruments in place to provide coverage on a large portion of its estimated fuel consumption at varying price levels 
the company had derivative contracts in place for approximately percent of its estimated fuel consumption at prices up to approximately per barrel of crude oil 
the company also recently sold crude oil call options  which decreased its protection to effectively percent of estimated consumption if market prices settle in the to per barrel range 
the company also added another layer of purchased crude oil call options to increase its protection to approximately percent of estimated consumption if market prices exceed per barrel 
in addition to these positions  the company also had unsettled fuel derivative instruments relating to its expected fuel consumption in through the company s fuel derivative portfolio consists of both instruments that were entered into up until mid to hedge future jet fuel purchases  and instruments entered into to offset the majority of these original positions when market prices plummeted in the second half of and in early the decision to offset this original portfolio also benefitted the company by reducing its exposure to cash collateral requirements the company would be required to post with its counterparties if market prices continued to fall 
when the company 
table of contents entered into these offsetting positions  the company undesignated the majority of its original hedges and began to mark those positions to market along with the offsetting positions 
however  the company continues to have significant amounts frozen in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci from the time that this original hedge portfolio received special hedge accounting  and these amounts will be recognized in the income statement in future periods when the underlying fuel derivative contracts settle 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has deferred losses in aoci of million  net of tax  related to fuel derivative contracts 
the estimated fair market value as of december  of the company s net fuel derivative contracts for through reflects a net pretax liability of approximately million  including the effect of million in cash collateral that had been provided to counterparties as of december   which has been netted against the company s liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the following table displays the company s estimated fair value of remaining fuel derivative contracts not considering the impact of the million in cash collateral provided to counterparties as well as the amount of deferred losses in aoci at december   and the expected future periods in which these items are expected to settle and or be recognized in earnings in millions year fair value liability of fuel derivative contracts at december  amount of losses deferred in aoci at december  net of tax total based on forward market prices and the amounts in the above table and excluding any other subsequent changes to the fuel hedge portfolio  the company s jet fuel costs per gallon are expected to exceed market ie  unhedged prices during each of these periods 
this is based primarily on expected future cash settlements associated with fuel derivatives  but excludes any impact associated with the ineffectiveness of fuel hedges or fuel derivatives that are marked to market value because they do not qualify for special hedge accounting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
based on forward market prices as of january   and considering only the expected net cash payments related to hedges that will settle in first quarter  the company estimates its jet fuel price per gallon  including taxes  will be approximately for first quarter assuming no changes to the company s current fuel derivative portfolio  and considering only the expected net cash payments related to hedges that will settle in  the company is providing a sensitivity table for first quarter and full year jet fuel prices at different crude oil assumptions as of january   and for expected premium costs associated with settling contracts each period

table of contents maintenance materials and repairs were flat on a dollar basis  but increased percent on a per asm basis compared to on a dollar basis  an increase in engine expense was mostly offset by a decrease in airframe expense 
the majority of the increase in engine costs related to the company s aircraft  which for the second half of and all of were accounted for under an agreement with ge engines services  inc ge engines that provides for engine repairs to be done on a rate per flight hour basis 
for the first half of  these aircraft engines were accounted for on a time and materials basis and there were very few repair events 
the expense for engines recognized in associated with the current agreement exceeded the expense recognized in under this engine agreement  which is similar to the power by the hour agreement with ge engines the company has in place for its and fleet  payments are primarily based on a rate per flight hour basis 
since the company has effectively transferred the risk for specified future repairs and maintenance on these engines to the service provider  expense is recorded commensurate with each hour flown on an engine 
the decrease in airframe expense primarily was due to a decline in the number of scheduled airframe maintenance events versus on a per asm basis  the increase in maintenance materials and repairs compared to primarily was due to the increase in engine costs combined with the company s percent decline in asms 
the company expects maintenance materials and repairs per asm for first quarter to exceed the 
cents per asm experienced in first quarter  based on currently scheduled airframe maintenance events and projected engine hours flown 
aircraft rentals expense per asm increased percent and  on a dollar basis  increased million 
both increases primarily were due to the fact that the company executed sale and leaseback transactions for a total of of its aircraft during december and the first half of  combined with the impact of the company s percent asm reduction for compared to all of the lease agreements executed as part of the sale and leaseback transactions were classified as operating leases 
as a result of these transactions  the company currently expects rental expense per asm for first quarter to be similar to the 
cents per asm experienced in fourth quarter landing fees and other rentals increased million on a dollar basis and increased percent on a per asm basis  compared to the majority of both the dollar increase and per asm increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of higher rates charged by those airports for gate and terminal space 
the majority of these higher rates charged by airports was due to other airlines reduced capacity which in most cases exceeded the company s capacity reductions at those airports  as airport costs are then allocated among a fewer number of total flights 
as a consequence of continued rate inflation at various airports  the company currently expects landing fees and other rentals per asm in first quarter to be in the mid 
cents per asm range 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million on a dollar basis compared to  and was up percent on a per asm basis 
the increase on a dollar basis primarily was due to higher owned aircraft depreciation expense  primarily due to a reduction in the estimated salvage values of owned aircraft that were recently retired or are expected to be retired over the next two years  based on current and expected future market conditions for used aircraft 
this increase in expense was mostly offset by the execution of sale and leaseback agreements for previously owned s during the first half of the increase on a per asm basis primarily was due to the fact that the company s fleet size remained constant  while it reduced the number of asms flown as a result of economic conditions 
for first quarter  the company expects depreciation expense per asm to increase slightly from fourth quarter s 
cents 
other operating expenses decreased million  but were up percent on a per asm basis  compared to approximately percent of the decrease on a dollar basis was due to lower bad debt expense related to revenues from credit card sales  and another percent of the decrease was due to lower personnel expenses  primarily due to the reduction in headcount  the company s decline in capacity versus  and other cost reduction efforts 
on a per asm basis  the increase in operating expenses per asm primarily was due to an increase in advertising expense compared to combined with the reduction in asms 
the company currently expects other operating expenses on a per asm basis for first quarter to be slightly higher than the cents experienced in fourth quarter 
table of contents other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense increased by million  or percent  primarily due to new debt issuances  including the company s december issuance of million of secured notes  its borrowing under its million term loan in may  and its july million borrowing under a term loan agreement 
these issuances were partially offset by declines in floating interest rates associated with the company s floating rate debt 
the company currently expects a decrease in first quarter interest expense compared to fourth quarter  primarily due to lower floating interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on long term debt transactions 
capitalized interest declined percent  or million  compared to  due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates 
interest income decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a decrease in average rates earned on invested cash and short term investment balances 
other gains losses  net  primarily includes amounts recorded in accordance with the company s hedging activities

income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  increased to percent in from percent in the lower rate included a million 
per share  diluted net reduction related to the first quarter reversal of a revision in illinois income tax laws 
the rate also includes the impact of slightly higher effective state income tax rates 
the company currently expects its effective tax rate to be approximately percent 
compared with the company s net income of million 
per share  diluted in represented a decrease of million  or percent  compared to its net income of million 
per share  diluted 
the majority of the decline in net income was due to the fluctuation of certain gains and losses recorded in association with fluctuations in value of the company s fuel hedge portfolio 
these included adjustments impacting earnings through the recording of gains and or losses in and associated with fuel derivatives expiring in future periods  and settlement expiration of fuel derivative instruments for cash in or  but for which gains and or losses had been recorded in earnings in a prior period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
both of these types of adjustments are related to the ineffectiveness of hedges and the loss of hedge accounting for certain fuel derivatives 
adjustments associated with fuel derivative instruments included million in net losses for  and million in net gains for these are 
table of contents included in other gains losses  net  which is below the operating income line  in both periods 
due to the fact that the fluctuation in value of the company s hedge portfolio has resulted in large adjustments to other gains losses  net  the company believes operating income provides a better indication of the company s financial performance for both and than does net income 
the company s operating income was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to the majority of this decrease in was due to the substantial increase in fuel expense  despite the fact that the company benefited tremendously from its fuel hedging program 
entering  the company had instruments in place for over percent of its anticipated fuel consumption needs at an average crude oil equivalent price of per barrel 
even with this protection  however  the company s average jet fuel cost per gallon increased from in to in operating revenues consolidated operating revenues increased billion  or percent  primarily due to a billion  or percent  increase in passenger revenues 
despite carrying approximately the same number of passengers as  the company was able to generate an percent increase in average fares 
the company raised fares several times during in an attempt to keep up with rapidly increasing jet fuel prices 
this strategy was aided by the company s own slowdown in growth as well as significant capacity reductions by competitors in certain of the company s markets 
the company purchased a total of new boeing aircraft during  and returned nine s from lease  resulting in the net addition of aircraft for the year 
this fleet growth enabled the company to fly percent more asms in versus the prior year 
however  as a result of higher fares and general economic conditions  revenue passenger miles rpms increased only percent  resulting in a load factor decrease of points to percent 
as a result of the company s management of fares  passenger revenue yield per rpm passenger revenues divided by rpms increased percent compared to unit revenue operating revenues divided by asms also increased percent compared to levels  primarily as a result of the higher rpm yield 
consolidated freight revenues increased million  or percent  versus this increase primarily was due to higher rates charged for cargo and freight during other revenues increased million  or percent  compared to approximately half of the increase was due to an increase in charter revenues versus as the company flew charters that were not operated by competitors due to capacity reductions and or bankruptcy 
the majority of the remainder of the increase was from higher commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored chase visa card 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased billion  or percent  compared to a percent increase in capacity 
historically  except for changes in the price of fuel  changes in operating expenses for airlines are largely driven by changes in capacity  or asms

table of contents the company s casm cost per available seat mile increased percent compared to approximately percent of this increase was due to the increase in fuel expense  net of gains from the company s fuel hedging program 
the majority of the remainder of the increase was due to higher airport costs and maintenance expense 
as a result of higher fuel prices throughout much of  the company continued its diligent focus on improving fuel efficiency and controlling non fuel costs 
the company implemented various technology improvements  which have improved efficiency and enabled the company to grow headcount at either the same or a slower rate than capacity 
salaries  wages  and benefits increased million on an absolute dollar basis 
nearly the entire increase was from higher salaries and wages  primarily as a result of higher average wage rates 
an increase in health and workers compensation benefits primarily caused by inflationary increases in the cost of medical care was mostly offset by a million decrease in profitsharing  attributable to lower income available for profitsharing 
the company s profitsharing expense excludes the unrealized gains and or losses the company records in its fuel hedging program 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on fuel hedging and the related accounting requirements 
salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm was basically flat compared to salaries and wages per asm increased primarily due to higher wage rates  but were almost completely offset by a decline in profitsharing expense per asm  as capacity grew percent  but profitsharing expense declined percent versus fuel and oil expense increased billion  or percent  and on a per asm basis increased percent versus both the dollar and the per asm increase were driven primarily by a percent increase in the average price per gallon for jet fuel  including the impact of fuel derivatives used in hedging  and including related taxes 
as a result of the company s fuel hedging program and related accounting requirements  the company recognized net gains totaling billion in relating to fuel derivative instruments versus million of net gains recognized in cash settlements realized from the expiration settlement of fuel derivatives were billion in versus million for the primary reason that gains recognized in fuel and oil expense during were less than the cash settlement of fuel derivatives was due to the fact that a portion of the gains associated with these settlements had already been recognized in earnings in prior periods  as they were associated with ineffective hedges or derivatives that did not qualify for special hedge accounting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in fuel prices was partially offset by steps the company has taken to improve the fuel efficiency of its aircraft  its aircraft engines  and its flight plans and procedures 
these steps resulted in a percent reduction in fuel gallons consumed per asm flown for versus maintenance materials and repairs per asm increased percent compared to  while increasing million on a dollar basis 
on both a dollar basis and a per asm basis  engine expense accounted for almost percent of the increase and airframe expense accounted for approximately percent of the increase 
the majority of the increase in engine costs related to the company s aircraft 
for all of and the first half of  these aircraft engines were accounted for on a time and materials basis 
during the first half of  there were significantly more repair events for these engines than in the first half of this was due to the fact that the is the newest aircraft type in the company s fleet  and  as this fleet has matured  the number of engines on these aircraft undergoing their first major overhaul has increased 
in june  the company transitioned to a new engine repair agreement for these aircraft and expense is now based on flight hours associated with engines 
the expense for engines recognized in the second half of associated with the new agreement also exceeded the expense recognized in the second half of  when repairs were still being accounted for on a time and materials basis 
the increase in airframe expense primarily was due to more planned airframe inspection and repair events than in the prior year 
these events  which are required based on the number of flight hours each individual aircraft has flown  were higher in number as well as cost per event 
aircraft rentals expense per asm decreased percent and  on a dollar basis  decreased slightly 
both decreases primarily were due to the fact that the company returned nine operating lease aircraft to lessors during 
table of contents while the company s overall asm capacity increased percent through purchases of new aircraft from boeing 
the company executed a sale and leaseback of five of its aircraft during december  and the leases qualified as operating leases 
landing fees and other rentals increased million on a dollar basis and increased percent on a per asm basis  compared to the majority of both the dollar increase and per asm increase was due to higher space rentals in airports as a result of both space increases by the company to accommodate new flight activity and higher rates charged by those airports for gate and terminal space 
a portion of these higher rates charged by airports was due to other airlines reduced capacity  as airport costs are then allocated among a fewer number of total flights 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million on a dollar basis compared to  and was up percent on a per asm basis 
the dollar increase primarily was due to the new aircraft purchased by the company during on a per asm basis  the increase was due to a higher proportion of the company s growth being accomplished through owned aircraft 
prior to the sale and leaseback of five aircraft executed during december  the company had purchased the new aircraft received during and had returned nine previously leased aircraft back to lessors  thereby increasing the percentage of the fleet owned 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s future aircraft deliveries and note for information on the sale and leaseback transactions 
other operating expenses increased million and were up percent on a per asm basis  compared to the majority of the increases on both a dollar basis and a per asm basis were due to an increase in revenue related costs such as credit card processing fees associated with the percent increase in passenger revenues 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense increased by million  or percent  primarily due to the company s issuance of million pass through certificates in october  the company s borrowing under its million term loan in may  and its borrowing of million of the available million under its revolving credit facility in october these issuances were partially offset by declines in floating interest rates associated with the company s floating rate debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on long term debt transactions 
capitalized interest declined percent  or million  compared to  due to a reduction in progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries and lower interest rates

during the first half of  the company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges  as well as the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they did not qualify for special hedge accounting  as commodity prices rose during that period 
during the second half of  when commodity prices fell  the company recorded significant losses from hedge ineffectiveness and derivatives not qualifying for special hedge accounting  thereby more than offsetting the gains previously recorded during the first half of the year 
during  the company recorded significant gains related to the ineffectiveness of its hedges as well as to the increase in market value of fuel derivative contracts that were marked to market because they did not qualify for special hedge accounting

the rate included an million addition to taxes from the enactment of the illinois tax law 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to billion used in operations in for the company  operating cash inflows primarily are derived from providing air transportation for customers 
the vast majority of tickets are purchased prior to the day on which travel is provided and  in some cases  several months before the anticipated travel date 
operating cash outflows primarily are related to the recurring expenses of operating the airline 
operating cash flows over the past three years have also been significantly impacted by the company s fuel hedge positions and the significant fluctuation in fair value of those positions and the corresponding cash collateral requirements associated with those positions 
in the consolidated statement of cash flows  increases and or decreases to these cash deposits are reflected in operating cash flows in the caption cash collateral received from provided to fuel derivative counterparties 
as of december   the amount of cash provided to fuel hedge counterparties was million  of which million has been netted against accrued liabilities and million of which is netted against other deferred liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
since the amount of cash collateral deposits provided by the company at december  was million  the net change in cash deposits for was a net operating outflow of million 
at december   the company had held billion in cash collateral from counterparties  which then resulted in a net outflow of billion during the fluctuation in these deposits during was due to the significant decline in fair value of the company s fuel derivative portfolio

during  the company also received million in proceeds from employees exercise of stock options and million from a credit line borrowing 
these inflows were partially offset by the company s repurchase of million of its common stock  representing a total of million shares 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the issuance and redemption of long term debt 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and contingent liabilities and commitments the company has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regard to future purchases of aircraft  payment of debt  and lease arrangements 
the company received boeing aircraft in  all of which were new aircraft from boeing 
the company also removed of its older leased and owned aircraft from service during and executed sale and leaseback transactions for of its owned aircraft 
as of december   the company had firm orders for a total of aircraft for the years through the company also had options for aircraft from through  with an additional purchase rights for aircraft through as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has the option to substitute s or s for the s 
this option is applicable to aircraft ordered from boeing and must be exercised months prior to the contractual delivery date 
the leasing of aircraft including the sale and leaseback of aircraft effectively provides flexibility to the company as a source of financing 
although the company is responsible for all maintenance  insurance  and expense associated with operating leased aircraft  and retains the risk of loss for these aircraft  it has not made any guarantees to the lessors regarding the residual value or market value of the aircraft at the end of the lease terms 
as of december   the company operated leased aircraft  of which are operating leases 
as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  assets and obligations under operating leases are not included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
disclosure of the contractual obligations associated with the company s leased aircraft is included below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the company is required to provide standby letters of credit to support certain obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business 
although the letters of credit are off balance sheet  the majority of obligations to which they relate are reflected as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
outstanding letters of credit totaled million at december  the following table aggregates the company s material expected contractual obligations and commitments as of december  obligations by period in millions contractual obligations beyond total long term debt interest commitments fixed interest commitments floating capital lease commitments operating lease commitments aircraft purchase commitments other purchase commitments total contractual obligations includes principal only related to fixed rate debt only interest obligations associated with floating rate debt either at issuance or through swaps is estimated utilizing forward interest rate curves as of december   and can be subject to significant fluctuation 
includes amounts classified as interest firm orders from boeing in addition to the above contractual fixed obligations  the company also had estimated obligations at december   related to its fuel derivative positions for the years through based on the contractual settlement date of those derivative instruments  but excluding the impact of the million in cash collateral deposits that have been provided to counterparties  which will effectively reduce the net cash flows paid as the derivative instruments settle 
although the fair value of these positions can fluctuate significantly based on forward market prices for crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline  the following table displays these estimated obligations as of december  in millions total fuel derivative obligations gross net of cash collateral deposits net fuel derivative obligations available to the company at december   was cash on hand and short term investments totaling billion  anticipated future internally generated funds from operations  and its million bank revolving line of credit 
in addition  the company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize liquidity and supplement cash requirements as needed 
notwithstanding current economic conditions and the current liquidity environment  the company believes it has access to financing arrangements because of its current investment grade credit ratings  unencumbered assets  modest leverage  and consistent profitability  which should enable it to meet its capital and operating requirements 
as of december   the book value of the company s unencumbered aircraft totaled approximately billion 
in  standard poor s and fitch both downgraded the company s credit rating from bbb to bbb based on lower demand  especially among business travelers  and continued volatility in fuel 
table of contents prices 
while the company s credit rating remains investment grade  as defined  the lower rating will likely result in a slight increase in its borrowing costs on a prospective basis 
moody s also downgraded the company s rating from baa to baa and also lowered the ratings of the company s ptcs and eetcs 
the downgrade of the company s senior unsecured debt rating was based on moody s expectation of continuing weak fundamentals of the domestic airline sector 
the downgrade of the company s ratings on its ptcs and eetcs reflects the reduction in the company s underlying credit quality  and with respect to the ptcs the elevated loan to value ratios resulting from the older vintage aircraft that are pledged as collateral for these transactions 
during  the city of dallas approved the love field modernization program lfmp  a project to reconstruct dallas love field airport with modern  convenient air travel facilities 
pursuant to a program development agreement pda with the city of dallas  the company is managing this project  and major construction is expected to commence during the first half of  with completion scheduled for the second half of although subject to change  at the current time the project is expected to include the renovation of the airport airline terminals and complete replacement of gate facilities with a new gate facility  including infrastructure  systems and equipment  aircraft parking apron  fueling system  roadways and terminal curbside  baggage handling systems  passenger loading bridges and support systems  and other supporting infrastructure 
although several aspects of the project have not yet been agreed upon or finalized  the pda contemplates that  at the company s request  the love field airport modernization corporation or lfamc  a local government corporation under texas law formed by the city of dallas would issue tax exempt facility revenue bonds lfmp bonds  the proceeds of which would be used to finance a significant portion of the ongoing costs of the lfmp  and to reimburse the company for up to million in early lfmp expenditures made from april   through the date of issuance of the lfmp bonds such expenditures and reimbursement were authorized pursuant to a june  inducement resolution approved by the dallas city council 
the pda provides for flexibility regarding the funding of the lfmp  and the parties to the pda are not locked in to the aforementioned preliminary funding plan 
repayment of the lfmp bonds would be through the facilities payments described below 
reimbursement of the company for its payment of facilities payments would be made through recurring ground rents  fees  and other revenues collected at the airport 
it is also anticipated that the company would guarantee principal  premium if any  and interest on the bonds 
prior to any issuance of the lfmp bonds by the lfamc  the pda further contemplates that the company would enter into two separate funding agreements a facilities agreement pursuant to which the company would be obligated to make debt service payments on the principal and interest amounts associated with the lfmp bonds facilities payments that are issued  less other sources of funds the city of dallas may apply to the repayment of the lfmp bonds including but not limited to passenger facility charges collected from passengers originating from the airport  and a revenue credit agreement pursuant to which the city of dallas would reimburse the company for the facilities payments made by the company 
a majority of the monies transferred from the city of dallas to the company under the revenue credit agreement are expected to originate from a reimbursement account created in the use and lease agreement that has been executed between the city of dallas and the company a year agreement providing for  among other things  the company s lease of space at the airport from the city of dallas 
the remainder of such monies is expected to originate from use and lease agreements with other airlines  various concession agreements  and other airport miscellaneous revenues 
the company s liquidity could be impacted by the lfmp to the extent there is not a successful bond issuance  or there is a timing difference between the company s payment of the facilities payments pursuant to the facilities agreement and the transfer of monies back to the company pursuant to the revenue credit agreement  however  the company does not currently anticipate the occurrence of these items 
the lfmp is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s capital resources or financial position 
in  the company s board of directors authorized two separate programs for the repurchase of up to a total of million of the company s common stock million authorized in march  and 
table of contents million authorized in may repurchases were made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions 
these programs  the last of which was completed during third quarter  resulted in the repurchase of a total of approximately million shares 
during january  the company s board of directors authorized an additional program for the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
repurchases have been and will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions 
the company repurchased million shares for a total of million as part of this program through february   however  the company has not repurchased any additional shares from that date through the date of this filing 
the company does not believe it is prudent to repurchase shares at the current time considering the unstable financial markets and volatile fuel prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  tickets sold for passenger air travel are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds and exchanges of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the balance in air traffic liability fluctuates throughout the year based on seasonal travel patterns and fare sale activity 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december   was billion  compared to million as of december  estimating the amount of tickets that will be refunded  exchanged  or forfeited involves some level of subjectivity and judgment 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
according to the company s contract of carriage  tickets whether refundable or nonrefundable that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds and exchanges  net of forfeitures  for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and other airlines have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date of travel 
estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets 
holding other factors constant  a ten percent change in the company s estimate of the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets during would have resulted in a million  or 
percent  change in passenger revenues recognized for that period 
events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates within a narrow range of acceptable amounts 
if actual refunds  exchanges  or forfeiture 
table of contents experience results in an amount outside of this range  estimates and assumptions are reviewed and adjustments to air traffic liability and to passenger revenue are recorded  as necessary 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds and exchanges include  but may not be limited to  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  promotional fare activity  and the impact of the economic environment on customer behavior 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund  exchange  and forfeiture activity may vary from estimated amounts 
the company s estimation process resulted in no material adjustments being recorded during the years or during the fourth quarter of and throughout  as a result of the company s efforts to stimulate demand through fare sales  passenger revenues consisted of a higher percentage of discount tickets flown and a lower percentage of fully refundable tickets flown 
consequently  the company s estimate of the amount of refunded  exchanged  or forfeited tickets recorded during was in a range of approximately percent to percent higher than what it believes its historical averages would indicate 
the company believes these estimates are supported by actual data and are reasonable given the underlying fact patterns 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for future refunds  exchanges  and forfeited tickets would be reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion at cost of long lived assets  including billion at cost in flight equipment and related assets 
flight equipment primarily relates to the boeing aircraft in the company s active fleet at december   which are either owned or on capital lease  plus four older aircraft that are not in active service 
the remaining boeing aircraft in the company s fleet at december   are on operating lease 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
the following table shows a breakdown of the company s long lived asset groups along with information about estimated useful lives and residual values of these groups estimated useful life estimated residual value aircraft and engines to years aircraft parts fleet life ground property and equipment to years leasehold improvements years or lease term in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company primarily has relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types  current and projected future market information  and recommendations from boeing 
aircraft estimated useful lives are based on the number of cycles flown one take off and landing 
the company has made a conversion of cycles into years based on both its historical and anticipated future utilization of the aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual cycles during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation and amortization expense  as required by gaap 
when appropriate  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses 
table of contents associated with the use of the long lived asset 
while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators  the company has continued to operate virtually all of its aircraft  generate positive cash flow  and produce operating profits 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairment related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for expected lives  expected residual values  and impairment evaluations would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments primarily to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities and see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the company s fuel hedging program  and financial derivative instruments 
all derivatives are required to be reflected at market fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company was a party to over financial derivative instruments  related to its fuel hedging program  for the years from through the fair value of the company s fuel hedging financial derivative instruments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   not considering the impact of cash collateral deposits provided to counterparties  was a net liability of million  compared to a liability of million at december  the decrease in this liability primarily was due to an increase in energy prices throughout most of  as well as the expiration ie  settlement in which the company paid cash to counterparties of approximately million in fuel derivative instruments that related to of the million liability in fair value of fuel hedging financial derivative instruments at december   approximately million is expected to settle or expire during changes in the fair values of these instruments can vary dramatically based on changes in the underlying commodity prices  as has been evident in recent years 
during  market spot prices for crude oil peaked at a high of over per barrel and hit a low price of under per barrel both within a period of approximately five months 
during  these same prices ranged from a low of per barrel to a high of per barrel 
market price changes can be driven by factors such as supply and demand  inventory levels  weather events  refinery capacity  political agendas  and general economic conditions  among other items 
the financial derivative instruments utilized by the company primarily are a combination of collars  purchased call options  call spreads  and fixed price swap agreements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the company enters into financial derivative instruments with third party institutions in over the counter markets 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices 
forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil  heating oil  and unleaded gasoline and adjusted based on variations of those like commodities to the company s ultimate expected price to be paid for jet fuel at the specific locations in which the company hedges 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle  and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occurs and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are recognized in the financial statements 
in recent years  because of increased volatility in energy markets  the company s estimates of the presumed effectiveness of its hedges made at the time the hedges were initially designated have materially differed from 
table of contents actual results  resulting in increased volatility in the company s periodic financial results 
for example  historical data had been utilized in qualifying unleaded gasoline for hedge accounting under the presumption that derivatives of such commodity would result in effective hedges  as defined 
this historical data is updated every quarterly reporting period to ascertain whether hedge accounting is allowed for every commodity the company uses in its hedging program 
based on these updates  in certain prior periods  the company has in fact lost hedge accounting for all unleaded gasoline derivative instruments 
at such times  the company has marked all such derivatives to market value in each quarterly period  with all changes in value reflected as a component of other gains losses  net in the consolidated statement of income 
although commodities such as crude oil and heating oil have continued to qualify for hedge accounting in most cases  there have been instances in which the company has also lost hedge accounting in specific geographic locations for these commodities 
in these instances  the company has also marked such derivatives to market value with changes reflected in the income statement each reporting period 
although the company s prospective assessment has been utilized to ensure that crude oil and heating oil in most cases still qualify for hedge accounting in specific locations where the company hedges  there are no assurances that these commodities will continue to qualify in the future 
this is due to the fact that future price changes in these refined products may not be consistent with historical price changes 
if recent volatility in these commodity markets continues for an extended period of time or worsens in the near future  the company could lose hedge accounting altogether for all crude oil and heating oil derivatives  which would create further volatility in the company s financial results 
estimating the fair value of these fuel derivative instruments and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine their accounting treatment 
to the extent that the change in the estimated fair value of a fuel derivative instrument differs from the change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  both on a cumulative and a period to period basis  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge can result 
this could result in the immediate recording of noncash charges or income  representing the change in the fair value of the derivative  even though the derivative instrument may not expire settle until a future period 
likewise  if a derivative contract ceases to qualify for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recorded every period to other gains and losses in the income statement in the period of the change 
ineffectiveness is inherent in hedging jet fuel with derivative positions based in other crude oil related commodities  especially given the recent volatility in the prices of refined products 
due to the volatility in markets for crude oil and related products  the company is unable to predict the amount of ineffectiveness each period  including the loss of hedge accounting  which could be determined on a derivative by derivative basis or in the aggregate for a specific commodity 
this may result  and has resulted  in increased volatility in the company s financial statements 
the significant increase in the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains and losses on the change in value of derivative contracts settling in future periods recorded during recent periods has been due to a number of factors 
these factors include the significant fluctuation in energy prices  the number of derivative positions the company holds  significant weather events that have affected refinery capacity and the production of refined products  and the volatility of the different types of products the company uses for protection 
the number of instances in which the company has discontinued hedge accounting for specific hedges and for specific refined products  such as unleaded gasoline  has increased in recent years  primarily due to these reasons 
depending on the level at which the company is hedged at any point in time  as the fair value of the company s hedge positions fluctuate in amount from period to period  there could be continued variability recorded in the income statement  and furthermore  the amount of hedge ineffectiveness and unrealized gains or losses recorded in earnings may be material 
this is primarily because small differences in the correlation of crude oil related products could be leveraged over large dollar volumes 
the company continually looks for better and more accurate methodologies in forecasting future cash flows relating to its jet fuel hedging program 
these estimates are an important component used in the measurement of effectiveness for the company s fuel hedges 
the current methodology used by the company in forecasting forward jet fuel prices is primarily based on the idea that different types of commodities are statistically better predictors of forward jet fuel prices  depending on specific geographic locations in which the company hedges 

table of contents the company then adjusts for certain items  such as transportation costs  that are stated in fuel purchasing contracts with its vendors  in order to estimate the actual price paid for jet fuel associated with each hedge 
this methodology for estimating future cash flows ie  jet fuel prices has been consistently applied during   and  in accordance with the company s interpretation of applicable gaap 
the company also has not changed its method for either assessing or measuring hedge ineffectiveness during these periods 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the fair value of financial derivative instruments  and forward jet fuel prices  would be made or reported based on other reasonable assumptions or conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
share based compensation the company has previously awarded share based compensation pursuant to plans covering the majority of its employee groups  including plans adopted via collective bargaining  a plan covering the company s board of directors  and plans related to employment contracts with the chairman emeritus of the company 
during  the company recorded share based compensation expense of million  compared to million in expense for and million for the company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the company s stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
in estimating expected stock price volatility at the time of a particular stock option grant  the company relies on observations of historical volatility trends  implied future volatility observations as determined by independent third parties  and implied volatility from traded options on the company s stock 
for   and option grants  the company has consistently utilized a weighted average approach that calculates expected volatility using two thirds implied volatility and one third historical volatility 
in determining the expected term of the option grants  the company has observed the actual terms of prior grants with similar characteristics  the actual vesting schedule of the grant  and has assessed the expected risk tolerance of different optionee groups 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the black scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rates used were actual us treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
the expected dividend yield of the company s common stock over the expected term of the option on the date of grant was estimated based on the company s current dividend yield  and adjusted for anticipated future changes 
vesting terms for the company s stock option plans differ based on the type of grant made and the group to which the options are granted 
for grants made to employees under collective bargaining plans  vesting has ranged in length from immediate vesting to vesting periods in accordance with the period covered by the respective collective bargaining agreement 
for grants to other employees  options generally vest and become fully exercisable over three  five  or ten years of continued employment  depending upon the grant type 
for grants in any of the company s plans that are subject to graded vesting over a service period  the company recognizes expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
none of the company s grants include performance based or market based vesting conditions  as defined 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 

table of contents fair value measurements the company utilizes unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities 
at december   these included auction rate security investments  valued at million  a portion of its fuel derivative option contracts  which were a net asset of million  and million in other investments 
all of the company s auction rate security instruments are reflected at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would have qualified as level however  due to events in credit markets beginning during first quarter  the auctions for most of these instruments failed  and  therefore  the company has determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis or other type of valuation model as of december   which qualify as level the company s analyses consider  among other items  the collateralization underlying the security investments  the expected future cash flows  including the final maturity  associated with the securities  and estimates of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction or return to par value 
in association with this estimate of fair value  the company has recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of million  with an offsetting entry to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
given the quality and backing of the company s auction rate securities held  the fact that the company has not yet recorded a loss on the sale of any of these instruments  and the fact that it has been able to periodically sell instruments in the auction process  it believes it can continue to account for the estimated reduction in fair value of its remaining securities as temporary 
these conclusions will also continue to be evaluated and challenged in subsequent periods 
the company currently believes that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets for the majority of securities are almost entirely backed by the us government 
in addition  for the million in instruments classified as available for sale  these auction rate securities represented less than four percent of the company s total cash  cash equivalent  and investment balance at december   which it believes allows it sufficient time for the securities to return to full value 
for the million in instruments classified as trading securities  the company has entered into an agreement with the counterparty that allows the company to put the instruments back to the counterparty at full par value in june as part of this agreement  the company has entered into a line of credit in which it has received a million loan that is secured by the auction rate security instruments from that counterparty 
at the time of the first failed auctions during first quarter  the company held a total of million in securities 
since that time  the company has been able to sell million of these instruments at par value  in addition to the million subject to the agreement to be sold at par in june the company is also in discussions with other counterparties to determine whether mutually agreeable terms can be reached regarding the effective repurchase of its remaining securities 
the company determines the value of fuel derivative option contracts utilizing a standard option pricing model based on inputs that are either readily available in public markets  can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets  or are quoted by its counterparties 
in situations where the company obtains inputs via quotes from its counterparties  it verifies the reasonableness of these quotes via similar quotes from another counterparty as of each date for which financial statements are prepared 
the company has consistently applied these valuation techniques in all periods presented and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
due to the fact that certain inputs used in determining estimated fair value of its option contracts are considered unobservable primarily volatility  the company has categorized these option contracts as level as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges that are considered to be effective  as defined  are offset within accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the period in which the expected cash flow impacts earnings 
any changes in the fair value of fuel derivatives that are ineffective  as defined  or do not qualify for special hedge accounting  are reflected in 
table of contents earnings within other gains losses  net  in the period of the change 
because the company has extensive historical experience in valuing the derivative instruments it holds  and such experience is continually evaluated against its counterparties each period when such instruments expire and are settled for cash  the company believes it is unlikely that an independent third party would value the company s derivative contracts at a significantly different amount than what is reflected in the company s financial statements 
in addition  the company also has bilateral credit provisions in some of its counterparty agreements  which provide for parties or the company to provide cash collateral when the fair values of fuel derivatives with a single party exceeds certain threshold levels 
since this cash collateral is based on the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding fuel derivative contracts  this provides further validation to the company s estimate of fair values 
frequent flyer accounting the company utilizes estimates in its recognition of liabilities associated with its frequent flyer program 
these estimates include the liability associated with frequent flyer awards that have been issued  are outstanding  and are expected to be redeemed at a future date  and amounts associated with frequent flyer credits sold to companies participating in its rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
a customer must earn a minimum of frequent flyer credits in order to attain a round trip award  and these credits cannot be utilized for any other type of product or service from the company 
in addition  once earned  a frequent flyer credit remains active and in the customer s account for up to months before expiration 
once a customer earns their th frequent flyer credit  a round trip award is automatically issued to the customer  which can then be utilized for any destination available on southwest  for up to a twelve month period before it expires 
this standard award is subject to seat restrictions depending on the availability on a particular flight 
if a customer accumulates two standard awards  they can be converted into a freedom award  which is free of seat restrictions except for a limited number of black out dates around major holidays 
the company utilizes the incremental cost method of accounting for frequent flyer awards issued from flight credits earned in the company s rapid rewards frequent flyer program 
as such  the company records a liability and reduction of passenger revenue for the estimated incremental cost of providing free travel at the time an award is earned 
the liability recorded by the company represents the total number of awards expected to be redeemed by customers 
the estimated incremental cost of an award includes direct passenger costs such as fuel  food  and other operational costs  but does not include any contribution to overhead or profit 
the company does not record a liability for partially earned customer awards  although it expects that a portion of these partially earned awards will eventually turn into full awards 
at december   the company had approximately million full or partial awards outstanding  of which approximately million were partially earned awards 
considering historical and expected future spoilage of both flight credits and awards  the company estimates that a liability associated with partially earned awards would not be material to the company s financial position at december   utilizing the incremental cost method of accounting for such awards 
the company also sells frequent flyer credits and related services to companies participating in its frequent flyer program 
funds received from the sale of flight segment credits are accounted for under the residual method 
under this method  the company has estimated that approximately percent of the amount received per flight segment credit sold relates to free travel  and the remaining percent associated with items such as access to the company s frequent flyer program population for marketing solicitation purposes  use of the company s logo on co branded credit cards  and other trademarks  designs  images  etc 
of the company for use in marketing materials 
this apportionment of value between free travel and marketing services is estimated based on several factors  including fares  the habits of customers in redeeming awards for free travel  and the contractual rate paid by companies for the flight segment credits 
the amount estimated to be associated with free travel has historically been in a range of percent to percent 
the estimated amounts associated with travel are deferred and recognized as passenger revenue when the travel is estimated to be flown  along with the portion that expires unused 
for the portion of funds received that is deemed not to be associated with future 
table of contents travel  the company has determined that the period earned is the period in which the company has fulfilled its obligation under the contract signed with the particular business partner  which is on a monthly or quarterly basis  upon sale  as the related marketing services are performed or provided 
the vast majority of these marketing services consist of the access granted  either monthly or quarterly  to various lists of the company s frequent flyer members 
the estimated amount that is not associated with free travel is recognized in other revenue in the period earned 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the liabilities associated with its frequent flyer program would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has interest rate risk in its floating rate debt obligations and interest rate swaps  commodity price risk in jet fuel required to operate its aircraft fleet  and market risk in the derivatives used to manage its fuel hedging program 
in addition  the sale leaseback transactions entered into by the company in december and in for a total of aircraft  have lease payments that fluctuate based in part on changes in market interest rates 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to manage market risk through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
the company has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and financial derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  except for the aircraft that were sold and leased back in and  the remainder of the company s leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
hedging the company utilizes financial derivative instruments  on both a short term and a long term basis  as a form of insurance against the potential for significant increases in fuel prices 
the company believes there is significant risk in not hedging against the possibility of such fuel price increases 
the company expects to consume approximately billion gallons of jet fuel in based on this usage  a change in jet fuel prices of just one cent per gallon would impact the company s fuel and oil expense by approximately million per year  excluding any impact of the company s derivative instruments 
as of december   the company held a net position of fuel derivative instruments that effectively represented a hedge of approximately ten percent of its anticipated jet fuel purchases for each year from through prior to fourth quarter  the company had held fuel derivative instruments for a significant portion of its anticipated fuel purchases for these years  however  due to a precipitous decline in fuel prices  the company significantly reduced its hedge in order to minimize fuel hedging losses related to further oil price declines and to minimize the potential for the company to provide additional cash collateral deposits to counterparties 
the company accomplished this reduced hedge by entering into additional derivative contracts through selling primarily fixed price swap derivatives 
the company believes this strategy enabled it to participate in further price declines via the sold derivatives  which materially offset further declines in value of the company s previously purchased derivatives 
subsequently  in  the company again added to its hedging position related to future years expected fuel purchases 
the total net fair value of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   was a net liability of million 
this balance consists of a net liability of the market value of fuel derivative instruments totaling million  net of million in cash collateral that has been provided by the company to its counterparties 
the current portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  net of cash collateral 
table of contents provided  is classified as a component of accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  net of cash collateral provided  is included in other deferred liabilities 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december  for all years from through  prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by up to approximately million 
fluctuations in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
in addition  this does not consider changes in cash collateral provided to or by counterparties  which would fluctuate in an amount equal to or less than this amount  depending on the type of collateral arrangement in place with each counterparty 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december   levels  except underlying futures prices 
the company s credit exposure related to fuel derivative instruments is represented by the fair value of contracts with a net positive fair value to the company at the reporting date 
at such times  these outstanding instruments expose the company to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements 
to manage credit risk  the company selects and will periodically review counterparties based on credit ratings  limits its exposure to a single counterparty with collateral support agreements  and monitors the market position of the program and its relative market position with each counterparty 
however  if one or more of these counterparties were in a liability position to the company and were unable to meet their obligations  any open derivative contracts with the counterparty could be subject to early termination  which could result in substantial losses for the company 
at december   the company had agreements with all of its counterparties containing early termination rights triggered by credit rating thresholds and or bilateral collateral provisions whereby security is required if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount based on the counterparty s credit rating 
the company also had agreements with counterparties in which cash deposits and or pledged aircraft are required to be posted whenever the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties exceeds specific thresholds cash is either posted by the counterparty if the value of derivatives is an asset to the company  or is posted by the company if the value of derivatives is a liability to the company 
the following table provides the fair values of fuel derivatives  amounts posted as collateral  and applicable collateral posting threshold amounts as of december   at which such postings are triggered counterparty cp in millions a b c d e total fair value of fuel derivatives cash collateral held by cp aircraft collateral pledged to cp if credit rating is investment grade  fair value of fuel derivative level at which cash is provided to cp to to n a or or cash is received from cp n a aircraft is pledged to cp to to n a n a n a if credit rating is non investment grade  fair value of fuel derivative level at which cash is provided to cp to to zero zero zero or or cash is received from cp zero zero zero zero zero aircraft is pledged to cp to to n a n a n a cash collateral is provided at percent of fair value of fuel derivative contracts 
if either party is rated below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies  a cash collateral agreement would be negotiated with the cp 
thresholds may vary based on changes in credit ratings within investment grade 

table of contents at december   of the million in cash collateral deposits with the above counterparties under these bilateral collateral provisions  million has been netted against noncurrent fuel derivative instruments within other deferred liabilities and million has been netted against current fuel derivative instruments within accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
due to the terms of the company s current fuel hedging agreements with counterparties  in the company s judgment  it does not have significant additional exposure to future cash collateral requirements 
as an example  even if market prices for the commodities used in the company s fuel hedging activities were to decrease by percent from market prices as of december   given the company s current fuel derivative portfolio  its aircraft collateral facilities  and its investment grade credit rating  it would have to provide an additional million in cash collateral to its current counterparties 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also has a cash collateral agreement with one of its counterparties associated with its outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
under this agreement  if the aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding is a liability  the company becomes obligated to post collateral for the value of the liability in excess of million 
if the aggregate fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding is an asset  the counterparty becomes obligated to post collateral to the company for the value of the asset in excess of million 
if either party s credit rating were lowered to below investment grade  percent cash collateral is required for both parties 
as of december   the fair value of interest rate swap agreements outstanding with this counterparty was a net liability of million  thus no collateral amounts had been posted 
with other counterparties to which the company has interest rate swap agreements  no cash collateral is required as long as credit ratings remain at investment grade 
if either party s credit rating were lowered to below investment grade  the threshold amount at which cash collateral is required for both parties would become zero  or in one case  the parties would then negotiate an agreement 
with each of these other counterparties  the net fair value of the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   was either an asset to the company or was immaterial 
due to the significance of the company s fuel hedging program and the emphasis that it places on utilizing fuel derivatives to reduce its fuel price risk  the company has created a system of governance and management oversight and has put in place a number of internal controls designed so that procedures are properly followed and accountability is present at the appropriate levels 
for example  the company has put in place controls designed to i create and maintain a comprehensive risk management policy  ii provide for proper authorization by the appropriate levels of management  iii provide for proper segregation of duties  iv maintain an appropriate level of knowledge regarding the execution of and the accounting for derivative instruments  and v have key performance indicators in place in order to adequately measure the performance of its hedging activities 
the company believes the governance structure that it has in place is adequate given the size and sophistication of its hedging program 
financial market risk the vast majority of the company s assets are aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet and grow capacity steadily and profitably under the right conditions 
while the company uses financial leverage  it strives to maintain a strong balance sheet and has a bbb rating with fitch and standard poor s  and a baa credit rating with moody s as of december  the company s and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings were originally issued as floating rate debt 
in addition  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has converted certain of its long term debt to floating rate debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
this includes the company s million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured notes due  the million senior unsecured debentures due  the million secured notes due  and the million senior unsecured notes due although there is interest rate risk associated with these floating rate borrowings  the risk for the and french credit agreements is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt under certain conditions 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 

table of contents excluding the notes or debentures that have been converted to a floating rate as previously noted  the company had no fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding at december  the following table displays the characteristics of the company s secured fixed rate debt as of december  principal amount in millions effective fixed rate final maturity underlying collateral term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft term loan agreement specified boeing aircraft the carrying value of the company s floating rate debt totaled billion  and this debt had a weighted average maturity of years at floating rates averaging percent for the twelve months ended december  in total  the company s fixed rate debt and floating rate debt represented percent and percent  respectively  of total noncurrent assets at december  the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which totaled billion  and short term investments  which totaled billion  at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money market instruments  investment grade commercial paper  auction rate securities  and other highly rated financial instruments  depending on market conditions and operating cash requirements 
however  as a result of turmoil in credit markets  the company has discontinued further investments in auction rate securities 
because of the short term nature of these investments  the returns earned parallel closely with short term floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its floating rate debt  invested cash excluding cash collateral deposits held  if applicable  floating rate aircraft leases  and short term investments because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by less than million 
utilizing these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance excluding the impact of cash collateral deposits held or provided to counterparties  if applicable  short term investments  and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt 
the company is also subject to a financial covenant included in its revolving credit facility  and is subject to credit rating triggers related to its credit card transaction processing agreements  the pricing related to any funds drawn under its revolving credit facility  and some of its hedging counterparty agreements 
certain covenants include the maintenance of minimum credit ratings and or triggers that are based on changes in these ratings 
the company s revolving credit facility contains a financial covenant requiring a minimum coverage ratio of adjusted pre tax income to fixed obligations  as defined 
as of december   the company was in compliance with this covenant and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
however  if conditions change and the company fails to meet the minimum standards set forth in the revolving credit facility  there could be a reduction in the availability of cash under the facility  or an increase in the costs to keep the facility intact as written 
two of the company s hedging counterparty agreements contain ratings 
table of contents triggers in which cash collateral would be required to be posted with the counterparty if the company s credit rating falls below investment grade by two of the three major rating agencies  and if the company were in a net liability position with the counterparties 
as of december   there was no cash posted with these counterparties 
the company was in a net fuel hedge liability position with one of these counterparties at december  assuming its credit rating were below investment grade as of that date  the company would have been required to post approximately million in cash collateral deposits with that counterparty 
the company currently has processing agreements with organizations that process credit card transactions arising from purchases of air travel tickets by its customers utilizing american express  discover and mastercard visa 
credit card processors have financial risk associated with tickets purchased for travel because  although the processor generally forwards the cash related to the purchase to the company soon after the purchase is completed  the air travel generally occurs after that time  and the processor would have liability if the company does not ultimately provide the air travel 
under these processing agreements  and based on specified conditions  increasing amounts of cash reserves could be required to be posted with the counterparty 
a majority of the company s sales transactions are processed by chase paymentech 
should chargebacks processed by chase paymentech reach a certain level  proceeds from advance ticket sales could be held back and used to establish a reserve account to cover such chargebacks and any other disputed charges that might occur 
additionally  cash reserves are required to be established if the company s credit rating falls to specified levels below investment grade 
cash reserve requirements are based on the company s public debt rating and a corresponding percentage of the company s air traffic liability 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all credit card processing agreements 
however  the inability to enter into credit card processing agreements would have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
the company believes that it will be able to continue to renew its existing credit card processing agreements or will be able to enter into new credit card processing agreements with other processors in the future
