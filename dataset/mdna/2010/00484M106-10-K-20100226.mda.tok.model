item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
background since we commenced operations in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the identification  development and commercialization of novel therapies that improve neurological function in people with ms and other neurological disorders 
ampyra  the first product for which we completed clinical development  was approved by the fda in january for the improvement of walking in people with ms 
this was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed 
to our knowledge  ampyra is the first and only product approved for this indication 
efficacy was shown in people with all four major types of ms relapsing remitting  secondary progressive  progressive relapsing and primary progressive 
the fda granted ampyra orphan drug status  which will provide seven years of market exclusivity for the drug 
in addition  we have issued patents that cover the formulation and use of ampyra 
we plan to file for patent term extension for ampyra under the hatch waxman law that allows for up to five additional years of patent protection based on the development timeline of a drug 
we plan to submit the applications by the deadline of march  although we plan to apply to extend the two patents we expect to be listed in the fda orange book for ampyra  we will ultimately need to select only one patent for extension  if granted 
our marketed drug  zanaflex capsules  which we began marketing in  is fda approved as a short acting drug for the management of spasticity 
we expect ampyra to be commercially available in the us in march and will market ampyra in the us through our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure  which also is responsible for sales and marketing of zanaflex capsules 
this organization consisted of sales  marketing  and managed markets personnel as of february   and includes sales representatives  which is an increase of since the approval of ampyra on january  we expect the majority of our expanded sales force to be fully trained and deployed on the first day of launch 
we are on target to complete our planned sales force expansion in march  with representatives fully trained and in the field 
we have contracted with a third party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run ampyra patient support services  a resource for support services for healthcare providers  people with ms and insurance carriers 
gross sales of zanaflex capsules  together with the generic version of tablets sold by us  were million in  an increase of over gross sales of million in our zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets commercial operations were cash flow positive in and we expect that our gross sales of zanaflex capsules for will decline  due to increasing managed care pressure  among other factors 
on june   we entered into the collaboration agreement with biogen idec  under which we granted biogen idec the exclusive right to develop and commercialize ampyra and other aminopyridine products in markets outside the us the collaboration agreement includes a sublicense of our rights under an existing license agreement with elan 
in january  biogen idec submitted a centralized maa to the ema and an nds to health canada for ampyra  known outside the us as fampridine 

table of contents in consideration for the rights granted to biogen idec under the collaboration agreement  we were entitled to a non refundable upfront payment of million as of june   which was received on july  also  as a result of such payment to us  a payment of million became payable by us to elan under our existing agreements with elan 
we are obligated to pay to elan an amount equal to of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to ampyra or other aminopyridine products 
we currently estimate the revenue recognition period for the upfront payment that we received from biogen idec to be approximately years from the date of the collaboration agreement 
the company recognized million in license revenue related to the million received from biogen idec and  in cost of license revenue related to the million paid to elan during the year ended december  we are also eligible to receive up to million from biogen idec should specified regulatory and sales milestones be met 
under the collaboration agreement  we will be entitled to receive double digit tiered royalties on sales of licensed products by biogen idec  its affiliates or certain distributors outside of the us  including from sales of ampyra 
under a related supply agreement  we will supply biogen idec with its requirements for dalfampridine through our existing supply agreement with elan and biogen idec will exclusively purchase all of its requirements for dalfampridine from us 
the purchase price paid by biogen idec for licensed products under the collaboration agreement and supply agreement reflects the prices owed to our suppliers under our supply arrangements with elan or other suppliers 
in addition  biogen idec will pay us  in consideration for its purchase and sale of ampyra  any amounts due by us to elan for ex us sales  including all royalties owed by us under the terms of our existing agreements with elan 
we have three preclinical programs focused on novel approaches to repair damaged components of the cns 
we believe all of our preclinical programs neuregulins  remyelinating antibodies and chondroitinase have broad applicability and have the potential to be first in class therapies 
while these programs have initially been focused on ms and sci  we believe they may be applicable across a number of cns disorders  including stroke and traumatic brain injury  because many of the mechanisms of tissue damage and repair are similar 
in addition  we believe that these programs may have applicability beyond the nervous system  including in such fields as cardiology  oncology  orthopedics and ophthalmology 
in  we began to work with a contract manufacturer to develop larger scale manufacturing and purification processes for one of the neuregulins  ggf  under cgmp in preparation for a potential future ind application to support human clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure 
we and the fda held a pre ind meeting to discuss an ind filing for heart failure 
we now expect to file an ind in early if the ind is accepted by the fda  we then expect to initiate a phase study of ggf in heart failure patients 
if we are able to establish a proof of concept for treatment of heart failure through human clinical studies  we believe that this may enable us to enter into a partnership with a cardiovascular focused company  and that such a partnership  if achieved  could more efficiently move ggf forward in a cardiac indication  while potentially providing us the capital to support our work on ggf in neurological indications 
we have also begun work with contract manufacturers to scale up manufacturing and purification processes for one of the remyelinating antibodies rhigm under cgmps for preparation for a future ind application 
we have had significant operating losses since inception as a result of our focus on clinical and preclinical development activities and our goal of building an internal sales  managed markets and marketing organization in the us we may incur losses for the next several years as we significantly increase expenditures to support an expanded sales and marketing organization and other activities in connection with the commercial launch of ampyra  as well as to support the advancement of our preclinical development programs 
we expect that our sales and marketing  general and administrative expenses in will increase substantially over levels  primarily 
table of contents due to launch costs and sales and marketing expenses for ampyra  including increases in sales  managed markets and medical affairs staff and the implementation of the work needed for our fda post marketing study commitments for ampyra  but this increase will vary based in part on our expectation of the level of ampyra sales 
we further expect that our research and development expenses in will increase over levels  principally in connection with completion of our ggf pre ind toxicology studies  expected ind filing and expected initiation of a phase ggf study  and implementation of our post marketing study commitments to the fda for ampyra 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we will also continue to explore opportunities to expand our pipeline through the potential in licensing and or acquisition of select products and technologies in neurology  with a particular focus on phase and phase product candidates 
we do not currently plan to acquire a marketed product during the first year following ampyra s commercial launch 
product revenue and returns to date  product revenue has consisted of sales of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets 
under sfas 
accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition when the right of return exists  we are not permitted to recognize revenue from zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets until we can reasonably estimate the likely return rate for our products 
we have accumulated some sales history with zanaflex capsules  however due to generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we cannot reasonably determine a return rate at this time 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
we continue to accumulate data and when we are able to reasonably estimate product returns we will then begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory held by the wholesaler as a component of inventory 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to end users because once prescriptions are filled the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
when we receive the prescription data  we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
under our revenue interest assignment agreement with an affiliate of paul royalty fund prf  as amended in november  prf is entitled to a specified portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
for more information regarding our agreement with prf  see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
we accept returns of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets for six months prior to and months after their expiration date 
we provide a credit to customers with whom we have a direct relationship or a cash payment to those with whom we do not have a direct relationship 
we do not exchange product from inventory for the returned product 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
we have not yet determined the revenue recognition model to be applied with respect to sales and returns of ampyra 

table of contents license revenue and cost of license revenue under the collaboration agreement with biogen idec  we were entitled to a non refundable upfront payment of million as of june   the date of the agreement  which was received on july  as a result of such payment to us  million became payable by us to elan under our existing agreements with elan 
these agreements obligate us to pay an amount equal to of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to ampyra or other aminopyridine products 
we currently estimate the revenue recognition period for the upfront payment that we received from biogen idec  and for any milestone payments made to us by biogen idec  and for the corresponding payments that we make to elan  to be approximately years 
discounts and allowances reserves with respect to zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets for wholesaler fees for services  cash discounts  medicaid and patient program rebates and chargebacks have been established 
at the time these products are shipped to wholesalers a charge is recorded to discounts and allowances and the appropriate reserves are credited 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate of historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for wholesaler fees for services  chargebacks  rebates and discounts are established based on contractual terms with customers and analyses of historical usage of discount  chargeback and rebate reserves 
we have not yet determined the model for revenue recognition and establishment reserves for ampyra 
grant revenue grant revenue is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred and our performance obligations under the terms of the respective contract are satisfied 
to the extent expended  grant revenue related to the purchase of equipment is deferred and amortized over the shorter of its useful life or the life of the related contract 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves when necessary  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the zanaflex acquisition  packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
our inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into in connection with our zanaflex acquisition 
any payments we make to prf in connection with the revenue interest assignment transaction entered into in december will not constitute royalty expense or otherwise affect our cost of sales 
see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  fees paid to professional service providers for independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data from our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development and depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products

this out of period adjustment did not increase the total interest expense associated with this agreement 
the increase in interest expense was partially offset by a  increase in interest income as a result of the investment of net proceeds from our follow on public offerings in february and august liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock  private placements of our securities  our financing arrangement with prf  our collaboration with biogen and to a lesser extent  from loans and government grants 
financing arrangements in january  elan international services  ltd 
eis loaned us an aggregate of million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes to partly fund our research and development activities 
on december   elan transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with saints capital 
as of december   million of these promissory notes were outstanding 
in january  we entered into a million senior secured term loan which was repaid during the three month period ended march  on december   we entered into a revenue interest assignment agreement with prf  a dedicated healthcare investment fund  pursuant to which we assigned to prf the right to a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
to secure our obligations to prf  we also granted prf a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to zanaflex 
our agreement with prf covers all zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interest assignment agreement with prf 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november and an additional million in february since our net revenues during the fiscal year exceeded million 
under the terms of the amendment  
table of contents we are required to pay prf million on december  and an additional million on december  the december  payment was made 
under the agreement and the amendment  prf is entitled to the following portion of zanaflex net revenues with respect to zanaflex net revenues up to and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million but less than and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  and with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues 
notwithstanding the foregoing  once prf has received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  prf will only be entitled to of zanaflex net revenues 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a liability as of december   referred to as the revenue interest liability  of approximately million 
we impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method and record a corresponding accrued interest liability 
the effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the life of the arrangement 
the interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors  including the level of zanaflex sales 
we currently estimate that the imputed interest rate associated with this liability will be approximately 
payments made to prf as a result of zanaflex sales levels will reduce the accrued interest liability and the principal amount of the revenue interest liability 
upon the occurrence of certain events  including if we experience a change of control  undergo certain bankruptcy events  transfer any of our interests in zanaflex other than pursuant to a license agreement  development  commercialization  co promotion  collaboration  partnering or similar agreement  transfer all or substantially all of our assets  or breach certain of the covenants  representations or warranties we make under the agreement  prf may i require us to repurchase the rights we sold them at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or ii foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf 
except in the case of certain bankruptcy events  if prf exercises its right  which we refer to as prf s put option  to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it  prf may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put call price as required 
if we experience a change of control we have the right  which we refer to as our call option  to repurchase the rights we sold to prf at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised 
the put call price on a given date is the greater of i all payments made by prf to us as of such date  less all payments received by prf from us as of such date  and ii an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to prf of on all payments made by prf to us as of such date  taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by prf from us as of such date 
we have determined that prf s put option and our call option meet the criteria to be considered an embedded derivative and should be accounted for as such 
therefore  we recorded a net liability of  as of december  related to the put call option to reflect its current estimated fair value 
this liability is revalued on a semi annual basis to reflect any changes in the fair value and any gain or loss resulting from the revaluation is recorded in earnings 
during any period during which prf has the right to receive of zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement  then of the first million in payments from zanaflex sales we receive from wholesalers will be distributed to prf on a daily basis 
following the end of each 
table of contents fiscal quarter  if the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter exceeds the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive  prf will remit such excess to us 
if the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive during such quarter exceeds the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter  we will remit such excess to prf 
investment activities at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in a treasury money market fund and high quality government bonds 
also  we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  as compared to million as of december  our short term investments consist of us treasury bonds with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year 
the balance of these investments was million as of december   as compared to million as of december  net cash provided by used in operations net cash provided by used in operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

net cash used in investing net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to million in purchases of short term investments  purchases of intangible assets of million  and purchases of property and equipment of million  offset by million in proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments 

table of contents net cash used in financing net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to million in repayments to prf which was partially offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options 
future capital needs our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of revenue generated from sales of ampyra and zanaflex capsules  the continued progress of our preclinical programs  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the amount and timing of milestone or other payments made under collaborative agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the licensing or acquisition of new products or technologies 
we expect to incur losses from operations as we continue to support and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure for the commercialization of ampyra  promote zanaflex capsules  continue our clinical development and advance our preclinical programs 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future operating requirements we will need to raise additional capital  reduce planned expenditures  or incur indebtedness to fund its operations 
we may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our sales and marketing efforts  delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research and development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
contractual obligations and commitments our major outstanding contractual obligations are for payments related to our licenses  our convertible notes  our facility leases and our commitments to purchase inventory 
the following table summarizes our minimum significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year years years prf payments convertible note payable operating leases milestone payments inventory purchase commitments total prf payments represents a million fixed payment due to prf on december  and excludes principal and interest payments  due to uncertainty as to the amount and timing of such payments 
represents annual payments of principal and interest to be made on the convertible note payable to saints capital starting on january  the first anniversary of ampyra fda 
table of contents approval 
this note is convertible  at the election of the holder at any time  into shares of common stock 
represents contingent milestone payments of million payable to elan and  payable to rush presbyterian upon fda approval of ampyra on january  also includes expected aggregate milestone payments of million to cenes pharmaceuticals plc and  to brigham and women s hospital related to an ind filing for ggf by the fda  which filing is expected in early represents zanaflex and ampyra launch inventory commitments 
under our zanaflex supply agreement with elan  we are required to provide to elan an month rolling forecast by the rd of each month and a two year forecast not later than july of each year 
we are bound to order of the forecast required quantities for each five month period immediately following each monthly forecast report 
also includes estimated ampyra launch commitments for the three months following december  pursuant to our ampyra supply agreement with elan 
we have agreed to purchase at least of its annual requirements of ampyra from elan  unless elan is unable or unwilling to meet its requirements  for a percentage of net product sales and the quantity of product shipped by elan to us 
under certain supply agreements and other agreements with manufacturers and suppliers  we are required to make payments for the manufacture and supply of our clinical and approved products 
under certain license agreements  we are required to pay license fees  milestones and royalties for the use of technologies and products in our r d activities and in the commercialization of products 
the amount and timing of any of the foregoing payments are not known due to the uncertainty surrounding the successful research  development and commercialization of the products 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  primarily employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our areas of critical accounting policies sales revenue recognition  research and development  income taxes  and share based compensation 

table of contents revenue recognition we apply the revenue recognition guidance in sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  
accounting standards codification asc  which among other criteria requires that future returns can be reasonably estimated in order to recognize revenue 
we cannot recognize revenue until we can reasonably estimate the likely return rate for our products 
we have accumulated some sales history with zanaflex capsules  however  due to generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we do not believe we can reasonably determine a return rate at this time 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
we continue to accumulate data and when we are able to reasonably estimate product returns we will begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of zanaflex capsules and tablets to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory shipped as inventory held by others 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
in addition to the prescription data we purchase  we also receive data that we use to monitor trends in sales from wholesalers to their customers 
we receive this data from an outside vendor on a monthly basis 
this data includes the number of bottles shipped from certain wholesalers to their customers 
we also compare our shipments to wholesalers to prescription reports to further assess inventory in the distribution channel on a monthly basis 
we use the wholesaler sales trend data and the wholesaler vs 
prescription comparison to better understand market conditions  but not as a basis for recognizing revenue 
we accept returns of products for six months prior to and months after their expiration date 
we provide a credit to customers with whom we have a direct relationship or a cash payment to those with whom we do not have a direct relationship 
we do not exchange product from inventory for the returned product 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
we recognize collaboration revenues by analyzing each element of the agreement to determine if it shall be accounted for as a separate element or single unit of accounting 
if an element shall be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes  the revenue recognition principles most appropriate for that element are applied to determine when revenue shall be recognized 
if an element shall not be treated separately for revenue recognition purposes  the revenue recognition principles most appropriate for the bundled group of elements are applied to determine when revenue shall be recognized 
payments received in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities including  salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  and research and development conducted for us by third parties  such as sponsored university based research  clinical trial vendors  contract manufacturing for our preclinical program  and regulatory consulting to support our nda filing 
in addition  research and development expenses include expenses related to grant revenue and the cost of clinical trial drug supply shipped to our clinical study 
table of contents vendors 
we account for our clinical study costs by estimating the patient cost per visit in each clinical trial and recognizing this cost as visits occur  beginning when the patient enrolls in the trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial  and the length of the treatment period for each patient 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accrual  such changes in estimate may be a material change in our clinical study accrual  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred except when we are accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
in these cases  these payments are capitalized at the time of payment and expensed when the research and development activity has been performed 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we did not record any tax provision or benefit for the year ended december  we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured at december  as of december   we had available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income  if any  and expire between and and research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  through for the year ended december   we incurred million for the alternative minimum tax which has been classified in general and administrative expense and utilized million of our net operating loss carry forward as a result of the upfront payment from biogen 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and expect to incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  the code  provides for a limitation of the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the code that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the code  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
share based compensation we account for stock options and restricted stock granted to employees and non employees by recognizing the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions in the financial statements at their fair values 
we estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form option pricing model based on assumptions for the expected term of the stock options  expected volatility of our common stock  prevailing interest rates  and an estimated forfeiture rate 

table of contents we have based our current assumptions on the following assumption method of estimating estimated expected term of options based on the th percentile of our peer companies expected volatility combination of historic volatility of our common stock since october  and the historic volatility of the stock of our peer companies risk free interest rate yields of us treasury securities corresponding with the expected life of option grants forfeiture rates historical forfeiture data of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of the employees and expected performance of our common stock 
increases in the term and the volatility of our common stock will generally cause an increase in compensation expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  grants receivable  convertible notes payable  accounts payable  and put call liability 
the estimated fair values of all of our financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts at december  we have cash equivalents and short term investments at december   which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as our interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds and us treasury bonds  the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximate their fair value at december  at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which had an average interest rate of approximately 
we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments
