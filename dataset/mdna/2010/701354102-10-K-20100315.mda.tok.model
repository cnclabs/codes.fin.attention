part i item business 
we were incorporated under the laws of the state of florida on august  we are in the business of designing  developing and selling our proprietary radio frequency rf technologies and products for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless communication products 
our business is expected to include licensing of our intellectual property and or the sale of integrated circuits based on our technology for incorporation into wireless devices designed by our customers 
our business also includes the joint development and marketing of wireless radio modules that incorporate our technologies 
in addition  from time to time  we provide engineering consulting and design services to our customers  for a negotiated fee  to assist them in developing prototypes and or products incorporating our technologies 
our business operates under a single segment 
refer to item to this annual report for select financial data including our net losses from operations and total assets 
we are primarily focused on incorporating our technologies into mobile handsets  but our technologies are applicable to other wireless products that are related to networks serving mobile handsets such as data cards  femtocells  machine to machine mm and embedded applications 
our technology can also be applied to non cellular radio applications such as military radios 
recent developments on november   we closed an offering for the sale of  shares of our common stock under a shelf registration statement for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
piper jaffray co 
piper jaffray acted as the sole underwriter and manager of the offering 
the net proceeds from the offering  after underwriter discounts and commissions and other offering expenses were approximately million and will be used for general working capital purposes 
general development of business in  we began educating prospective customers about the benefits of our technologies  with a primary focus on our rf transmit  or dp  technology and its unique ability to address certain high priority market needs related to mobile handset applications 
in  we completed our first dp integrated circuit ic which embodied many of the advancements of our technology and enabled us to begin demonstrating partially integrated prototypes 
throughout  and  we continued to further advance our prototype ics and increased the level of prototype integration while cultivating potential customer relationships 
our sales related activities during this period included prototype demonstrations of our dp platform  support of in depth technical due diligence by prospective customers  analysis of prospective customer product requirements  delivery of initial proposals and terms  and ultimately  negotiations of proposed business relationships 
we currently have three customers for our technology 
itt corporation itt entered into both a licensing and an engineering services agreement with us in during  itt engaged us under the engineering services agreement to analyze and evaluate the architectural design alternatives for incorporation of our technology into rf circuits based on various product specifications provided by itt 
in addition  in  we delivered a development demonstration platform to itt for their use in product development and demonstration to their customers 
in late and early  itt marketed our technology  based on our commercial designs  to a number of their customers and in october  itt was awarded a government contract for the demonstration of our technology in a highly integrated transceiver application for military products 
itt in turn  engaged us as a subcontractor to incorporate our commercial ics into an existing highly integrated transceiver platform 
the services related to this product demonstration are expected to be completed in the first quarter of under our licensing agreement with itt  we will collect a royalty on a per unit basis for any products sold by them that incorporate our technology 
late in  we also entered into a licensing and engineering services agreement with a global baseband chipset supplier whose name remains confidential under the terms of our agreement with them confidential licensee 
during  our product development efforts were largely focused on advancing our ics from prototype to production ready samples for this and other potential customers 
we delivered production ready dp silicon samples that met or exceeded all critical functional and performance requirements under our agreement to our confidential licensee late in during  we worked with our confidential licensee and other vendors on further refining our dp silicon samples for specific mobile phone standards and on developing various packaging designs and production test programs 
we also worked with our customer to co develop sample g mobile handsets for the purpose of verifying the technology in a working implementation  testing the technology in actual network operation and creating sales samples for our confidential licensee 
in october  our customer tested and accepted delivery of the initial sample handsets 
we are currently working with our customer to market this product to their customers and to set up the manufacturing arrangements for volume production 
under the terms of our licensing agreement this customer has the right to manufacture devices based on the licensed technology for a royalty on a per unit basis or we may sell such devices directly to third parties 
in december  we entered into a product and market development agreement the lgi agreement with lg innotek co  ltd 
lgi  a division of the lg group 
the agreement provides for a cooperative working relationship between us and lgi for the development and marketing of rf modules that incorporate our technologies for use in mobile applications such as wireless handsets and data cards 
the agreement provides for a supplier relationship between us and lgi whereby we would sell lgi tested  unpackaged integrated circuits for incorporation into modules 
the agreement initially contemplates modules designed for commercial hedge applications 
hedge is an acronym for applications that incorporate support for g  g and g waveform standards including gsm  edge  wcdma  and hspa 
during  we worked closely with lgi on both product development and joint marketing activities 
we are also exploring applications for modules that more closely align with the g offering of our confidential licensee in order to generate more near term revenue opportunities for lgi  our confidential licensee and us 
to date  we have generated no royalty or product revenue from our dp technology 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs and our ability to secure a reasonable market share through product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers and or products 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the third generation  or g  mobile handset market and generations that are evolving beyond g  such as g mobile handset standards and applications 
technology and products our wireless technologies represent unique  proprietary methods for processing rf waveforms in wireless applications 
the technology applies to the transmit baseband data to rf carrier signal and receive rf carrier signal to baseband data functions of a radio transceiver 
the transmit portion of the technology is called directpower  or dp  and enables the transformation of a baseband data signal to an rf carrier waveform  at the desired power output level  in a single unified operation 
the receiver portion of the technology is called directdata  or dd  and enables the direct conversion of an rf carrier to a baseband data signal 
although our primary sales efforts were focused on commercialization of our dp technology solutions  both of the agreements with customers in the commercial handset market contemplate future incorporation of our dd technology as well 
we have completed engineering prototypes of our dp based ics targeted at certain mobile handset applications 
the ics which incorporate the core rf technology were produced using a silicon germanium sige process through a fabrication relationship with ibm microelectronics ibm 
late in  we completed the integration of the digital engine that controls our rf transmit ic and interfaces to the mobile phone baseband processor 
this digital engine was produced through a third party fabrication relationship using a taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited tsmc cmos semiconductor process 
these ics are utilized to verify that our technology can be highly integrated in silicon and to demonstrate the benefits of the technology to target customers 
our current prototypes support functionality that is multi band meaning multiple frequencies and multi mode meaning multiple cellular standards and corresponding modulation formats 
our ics support multiple bands of cellular and pcs personal communications service frequencies and support the current and emerging cellular standards including gsm edge  cdma  w cdma  and hsupa 
we are also able to demonstrate e wimax and lte standards with our current ics  although we utilize the cellular and pcs frequencies for such demonstrations 
our unique technologies process the rf waveform in a more optimal manner than traditional technologies  thereby allowing the creation of handsets that have extended battery life  more easily incorporate multiple air interface standards and frequencies in smaller form factors  and reduce manufacturing costs 
our technologies provide such attractive benefits  in part  because of their unique integrated circuit architecture which enables creation of highly accurate rf waveforms that use less power than traditional linear transmitter architectures and components thereby extending battery life  reducing heat and enabling certain packaging advantages 
marketing and sales when we targeted the cellular industry in  our initial target customer base was focused on the top tier mobile handset manufacturers 
however  in and  mobile handset manufacturers were shifting rf innovation and developments to their chipset providers 
accordingly  we expanded our target customer base to include not only the mobile handset manufacturers  but also their component suppliers 
our confidential licensee and lgi are both component suppliers to mobile handset oems original equipment manufacturers and or odms original design manufacturers 
although our primary target market is the mobile handset industry  we have also explored potential relationships outside this target market to the extent that the requirements of the prospective customers are in concert with the needs of our primary target market 
this exploration resulted in our licensing agreement with itt 
our marketing and sales activities are currently focused on developing and capitalizing on relationships in the mobile handset industry 
although we believe our direct customers will likely be the chipset suppliers in this industry  we continue to cultivate our relationships with the mobile handset manufacturers who  at a minimum  exert major influence on their chipset suppliers 
in addition  our market awareness campaign includes network providers who exert significant influence on the oems in the mobile handset industry 
our sales and sales support activities include prototype demonstrations of both semi integrated and highly integrated circuits that showcase the benefits of our technology  support of detailed technology due diligence discussions and testing  analysis of potential customer product roadmaps and integration alternatives  negotiations of specific terms of potential business relationships  and both technical and sales support of customers during their design process 
we believe the sales cycle  from the initial customer meeting to the consummation of a business arrangement  can vary from six to twenty four months 
the length of the sales cycle is a result of many factors  including the unique nature of our technology  our lack of tenure in the cellular industry  the variety of integration decisions that must be evaluated by the customer in order to assess the specific value proposition for their needs  and the intense technology evaluation and due diligence required by target customers 
the intense technology evaluation and due diligence efforts are a result of the complex nature of rf technology  the complexity of the cellular specifications  and the unit volumes contemplated 
we believe the average sales cycle will shorten significantly as our technologies gain adoption in this market 
we executed our first two customer contracts in and an additional customer arrangement in our current sales and marketing focus is on assisting our customers to achieve design wins and to obtain orders from their customers 
we believe that the rate of adoption of our technology will increase as shipments of products incorporating our technologies commence 
future sales may be influenced by the terms negotiated with our customers and our ability to expand internal resources to support multiple customers 
competition we operate in a highly competitive industry against companies with substantially greater financial  technical  and sales and marketing resources 
our technologies  which are currently being marketed in the mobile handset industry  face competition from incumbent providers of transceivers and power amplifiers including companies such as anadigics  infineon  freescale  qualcomm  rf microdevices  skyworks  and st ericsson  among others 
each of our competitors  however  also has the potential of becoming a customer for our technologies 
we may also compete against rf engineering groups within the research and development organizations of our target customers  although we do not have such competition today within the confines of our existing three customers 
to date  we are unaware of any competing or emerging rf technologies that provide all the simultaneous benefits that our technology enables 
hurdles to the adoption of our technologies include entrenchment of existing technologies  the disruptive nature of our technology  and our lack of tenure in the markets we are targeting 
we believe we can gain adoption  and therefore compete  based on the performance and cost advantages enabled by our unique circuit architecture  as supported by a solid and defensible intellectual property ip portfolio 
our circuit architecture is capable of being compliant with all current mobile phone standards and can be configured to accept all standard baseband data inputs 
in addition  we believe that one or more of our technology s abilities to provide improved power efficiencies  highly accurate rf carrier waveforms  smaller form factors and better manufacturing yields  provides a solution to existing problems in applications for g standards and beyond that the mobile handset industry is seeking to solve 
production and supply our current business strategy is focused largely on the incorporation of our technology into mobile handsets and data devices that operate on wide area mobile networks 
in instances where our customer is a licensee of our ip  the production capacity risk shifts to that customer 
under our agreement with lgi  we will be supplying unpackaged  tested ics 
those ics will be produced for us under various foundry relationships 
we currently have a fabrication relationship with ibm for the production of our prototype ics on a sige process 
we have also produced ics through tsmc using a cmos semiconductor process 
we believe ibm and tsmc have sufficient capacity to meet our foreseeable needs 
in addition  our ics can be produced using different materials and processes  if necessary  to satisfy capacity requirements and or customer preferences 
patents and trademarks we consider our ip  including patents  patent applications  trademarks  and trade secrets to be significant to our competitive positioning 
we have a program to file applications for and obtain patents  copyrights  and trademarks in the united states and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
we currently have obtained us and foreign patents related to our rf technologies 
in addition  we have approximately us and foreign patent applications pending 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents to be fifteen to twenty years 
in addition  from time to time  we obtain licenses from others for standard industry circuit designs that are integrated into our own ics as supporting components that are peripheral to our core technologies 
we believe there are multiple sources for these types of standard circuits and we estimate the economic lives of the licenses to be two to five years based on estimated technological obsolescence 
research and development for the years ended december   and  we spent approximately million  million  and million  respectively  on company sponsored research and development activities 
our research and development efforts have been  and are expected to continue to be  devoted to the development and advancement of rf technologies  including the development of prototype ics for proof of concept purposes and production ready silicon samples and reference designs for our customers 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  of which are employed in engineering research and development  in sales and marketing  and in executive management  finance and administration 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we consider our employee relations satisfactory

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other risks and uncertainties described in this annual report  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial condition 
as a result of the risk factors set forth below  actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward looking statements 
we have had a history of losses which may ultimately compromise our ability to implement our business plan and continue in operation 
we have had losses in each year since our inception in  and continue to have an accumulated deficit which  at december   was approximately million 
the net loss for was approximately million 
to date  our technologies and products have not produced revenues sufficient to cover operating  research and development and overhead costs 
we also will continue to make expenditures on marketing  research and development  pursuit of patent protection for our intellectual property and operational costs for fulfillment of any contracts that we achieve for the sale of our products or technologies 
we expect that our revenues in will not bring the company to profitability 
if we are not able to generate sufficient revenues or we have insufficient capital resources  we will not be able to implement our business plan and investors will suffer a loss in their investment 
this may result in a change in our business strategies 
we expect to need additional capital in the future  which if we are unable to raise will result in our not being able to implement our business plan as currently formulated 
because we have had net losses and  to date  have not generated positive cash flow from operations  we have funded our operating losses from the sale of equity securities from time to time and the sale of our video division in we anticipate that our business plan will continue to require significant expenditures for research and development  patent protection  sales and marketing and general operations 
our current capital resources  including cash and cash equivalents at december  of million are expected to sustain operations through thereafter  unless we increase revenues to a level that covers operating expenses or we reduce costs  we will require additional capital to fund these expenses 
financing  if any  may be in the form of loans or additional sales of equity securities 
a loan or the sale of preferred stock may result in the imposition of operational limitations and other covenants and payment obligations  any of which may be burdensome to us 
the sale of equity securities will result in dilution to the current shareholders ownership 
the long term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from the sale of our products  additional funding  reducing expenses or a combination of the foregoing 
the failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise capital or reduce expenses could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our long term business objectives 
our industry is subject to rapid technological changes which if we are unable to match or surpass  will result in a loss of competitive advantage and market opportunity 
because of the rapid technological development that regularly occurs in the microelectronics industry  we must continually devote substantial resources to developing and improving our technology and introducing new product offerings 
for example  in fiscal years and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on research and development  and we expect to continue to spend a significant amount in this area in the future 
these efforts and expenditures are necessary to establish and increase market share and  ultimately  to grow revenues 
if another company offers better products or our product development lags  a competitive position or market window opportunity may be lost  and therefore our revenues or revenue potential may be adversely affected 
if our products are not commercially accepted  our developmental investment will be lost and our ability to do business will be impaired 
there can be no assurance that our research and development will produce commercially viable technologies and products 
if existing or new technologies and products are not commercially accepted  the funds expended will not be recoverable  and our competitive and financial position will be adversely affected 
in addition  perception of our business prospects will be impaired with an adverse impact on our ability to do business and to attract capital and employees 
if our patents and intellectual property do not provide us with the anticipated market protections and competitive position  our business and prospects will be impaired 
we rely on our intellectual property  including patents and patent applications  to provide competitive advantage and protect us from theft of our intellectual property 
we believe that many of our patents are for entirely new technologies 
if the patents are not issued or issued patents are later shown not to be as broad as currently believed  or are otherwise challenged such that some or all of the protection is lost  we will suffer adverse effects from the loss of competitive advantage and our ability to offer unique products and technologies 
as a result  there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and business prospects 
if we cannot demonstrate that our technologies and products can compete in the marketplace and are better than current competitive solutions  then we will not be able to generate the sales we need to continue our business and our prospects will be impaired 
we expect to face competition from chip suppliers such as anadigics  infineon  freescale  qualcomm  rf microdevices  skyworks  and st ericsson  among others 
our technology may also face competition from other emerging approaches or new technological advances which are under development and have not yet emerged 
if our technologies and products are not established in the market place as improvements over current  traditional chip solutions in wireless communications  our business prospects and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we rely  in large part  on key business and sales relationships for the successful commercialization of our products  which if not developed or maintained  will have an adverse impact on achieving market awareness and acceptance and will result in a loss of business opportunity 
to achieve a wide market awareness and acceptance of our products  as part of our business strategy  we will attempt to enter into a variety of business relationships with other companies which will incorporate our technologies into their products and or market products based on our technologies 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend in part on our ability to meet obligations under contracts with respect to the products and related development requirements 
the failure of these business relationships will limit the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our business development and our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we rely  in large part  on the ability of key customers to successfully develop and sell products incorporating our technologies  the failure of which will have an adverse impact on our business opportunities 
the successful commercialization of our products will depend  in part  on the success and timing of our customers product development and sales activities which may be impacted by factors outside of our control 
delays in or failure of our customers product development or sales activities will hinder the commercialization of our products which will have an adverse impact on our ability to generate revenues and recover development expenses 
we are highly dependent on mr 
jeffrey parker as our chief executive officer 
if his services were lost  it would have an adverse impact on our leadership and on how we are perceived within the industry and by investors 
because of mr 
parker s position in the company and the respect he has garnered in both the industry in which we operate and the investment community  the loss of his services might be seen as an impediment to the execution of our business plan 
if mr 
parker were no longer available to the company  investors might experience an adverse impact on their investment 
we currently have an employment agreement with mr 
parker and we maintain key employee life insurance for our benefit on mr 
parker 
if we are unable to attract or retain key executives and other highly skilled employees  we will not be able to execute our current business plans 
our business is very specialized  and therefore it is dependent on having skilled and specialized key executives and other employees to conduct our research  development and customer support activities 
the inability to obtain or retain these key executives and other specialized employees would have an adverse impact on the research  development and technical customer support activities that our products require 
these activities are instrumental to the successful execution of our business plan 
our outstanding options and warrants may affect the market price and liquidity of the common stock 
at december   we had  shares of common stock outstanding and had  exercisable options and warrants for the purchase of shares of common stock  assuming no terminations or forfeitures of such options and warrants 
on december  and  respectively  there will be  and  currently exercisable options and warrants assuming no new grants  exercises  terminations or forfeitures since december  
all of the underlying common stock of these securities is registered for sale to the holder or for public resale by the holder 
the amount of common stock available for the sales may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise capital and may affect the price and liquidity of the common stock in the public market 
in addition  the issuance of these shares of common stock will have a dilutive effect on current shareholders ownership 
provisions in the certificate of incorporation and by laws could have effects that conflict with the interest of shareholders 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
for example  the board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval  and there are pre notification provisions for director nominations and submissions of proposals from shareholders to a vote by all the shareholders under the by laws 
florida law also has anti takeover provisions in its corporate statute 
we have a shareholder protection rights plan that may delay or discourage someone from making an offer to purchase the company without prior consultation with the board of directors and management which may conflict with the interests of some of the shareholders 
on november   the board of directors adopted a shareholder protection rights plan which called for the issuance  on november   as a dividend  of rights to acquire fractional shares of preferred stock 
the rights are attached to the shares of common stock and transfer with them 
in the future the rights may become exchangeable for shares of preferred stock with various provisions that may discourage a takeover bid 
additionally  the rights have what are known as flip in and flip over provisions that could make any acquisition of the company more costly 
the principal objective of the plan is to cause someone interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with the board of directors rather than launch an unsolicited bid 
this plan may limit  prevent  or discourage a takeover offer that some shareholders may find more advantageous than a negotiated transaction 
a negotiated transaction may not be in the best interests of the shareholders

executive overview we are in the business of designing  developing and selling our proprietary rf technologies and devices for use in semiconductor circuits for wireless communication products 
we currently have three customer contracts for the incorporation of our technologies into wireless chipsets  modules and products 
two of the three customer agreements represent licensing arrangements whereby our customers will incorporate our ip into their own wireless semiconductor circuits and or radio products 
we also have engineering services agreements in place with these two customers whereby we will provide engineering services on a time and materials basis as requested by our customers 
the third contract represents a joint development and marketing agreement for the development of rf modules for incorporation into wireless products 
this agreement contemplates  upon completion of development  the negotiation of a supply agreement whereby we would supply our technology in the form of tested  unpackaged integrated circuits  also referred to as known good die or kgd  for incorporation into complete modules by our customer 
the two licensing customers include itt and the confidential licensee 
the confidential licensee is a fabless supplier of chipsets that support g  g and g mobile standards with engineering design and sales locations in both north america and asia 
the confidential licensee designs and supplies chipsets  and related handset reference designs  predominantly to handset oems and odms for incorporation into mobile handsets 
our joint development and marketing agreement is with lgi for the development of wireless radio modules for mobile handset and data card applications 
since exiting our wireless retail product business in  we have generated no product or royalty revenue from our wireless rf technologies 
we have recognized service revenue in and resulting from engineering design services provided to itt 
we anticipate initial royalty and or product revenue from one or more of these customer arrangements to commence in our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies and expand our market opportunities through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers 
we believe our technology has substantial advantages over competing technologies  especially in the g mobile handset market and generations that are likely to evolve beyond g  such as g mobile handset standards and applications 
we have made significant investments in developing our technologies and products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
since we have not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset our operating expenses  we have mostly relied on proceeds from the sale of equity securities to fund our operations 
we intend to continue to use our working capital to support future marketing  sales  research and development and general operations 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies affecting the preparation of our consolidated financial statements intangible assets patents  copyrights and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit 
we estimate the economic lives of our patents and copyrights to be fifteen to twenty years 
we estimate the economic lives of other intangible assets  including licenses  based on estimated technological obsolescence  to be two to five years  which is generally shorter than the contractual lives 
periodically  we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate impairment may exist triggering event 
based on our cumulative net losses and negative cash flows from operations to date  we assess our working capital needs on an annual basis 
this annual assessment of our working capital is considered to be a triggering event for purposes of evaluating the recoverability of our intangible assets 
as a result of our evaluation  and the significant excess of our market capitalization over our net book value at december   we determined that no impairment exists with regard to our intangible assets 
accounting for share based compensation we calculate the fair value of share based equity awards  including restricted stock  stock options and restricted stock units rsus  on the date of grant and recognize the calculated fair value  net of estimated forfeitures  as compensation expense over the requisite service periods of the related awards 
the fair value of share based awards is determined using various valuation models which require the use of highly subjective assumptions and estimates including i how long employees will retain their stock options before exercising them  ii the volatility of our common stock price over the expected life of the equity award  and iii the rate at which equity awards will be ultimately be forfeited by the recipients 
changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized as expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition we did not recognize any product or royalty revenue in  or we account for service revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we use the percentage of completion method of accounting for cost reimbursement type contracts which specify a certain billable fee amount 
revenues are recognized as costs are incurred assuming that collection is reasonably assured 
our cost of sales includes the direct labor costs of personnel providing services under these contracts  as well as indirect costs such as depreciation  amortization and allocated facilities costs 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on loss before taxes as reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when  based on available objective evidence  it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will not be realized 
on january  we adopted the provisions for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this standard prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this standard also provides guidance on recognition and classification of income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures 
recent accounting pronouncements on september   we adopted the new accounting standards codification asc as issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
the asc has become the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
the asc is not intended to change or alter existing gaap 
the adoption of the asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
unless needed to clarify a point to readers  we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes 
on june   we adopted the fasb guidance for subsequent events which requires public entities to evaluate subsequent events through the date that the financial statements are issued 
on january   we adopted the fasb guidance related to fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
adoption of this guidance did not have an effect on our operating income or net earnings 
on january   we adopted the fasb guidance for the determination of the useful life of intangible assets which amends the factors that should be considered in developing the renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the new guidance also requires expanded disclosure regarding the determination of intangible asset useful lives 
adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted the fasb guidance on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this guidance requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as participating securities when computing earnings per share  pursuant to the two class method 
our awards do not have non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents and  therefore  the adoption of this guidance did not have any impact on our financial statements 
results of operations for each of the years ended december   and revenues and gross margins we had no product or royalty revenues for the years ended december   or in october  we were engaged by itt under a fixed price service contract to incorporate our dp commercial integrated circuits into a highly integrated transceiver for purposes of demonstrating the performance of the device to one of itt s military customers 
the service contract is valued at approximately  for the year ended december   we recognized  in service revenue and approximately  or in gross margin related to this contract 
we recorded an additional  billed under this contract to deferred revenue at december  we expect to recognize the remaining revenue under this contract in the first quarter of for the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in service revenue and approximately  or  in gross margin related to engineering consulting services provided to itt 
these services included analysis and evaluation of architectural design alternatives for incorporation of our dp technology into rf circuits based on various product specifications provided by itt 
cost of sales for engineering services includes the direct labor costs  as well as overhead and other indirect costs including depreciation  amortization and allocated facilities costs 
indirect costs are allocated to cost of sales on a direct labor hour basis 
we anticipate initial royalty and or product revenue from one or more of our customer arrangements to commence in research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in outside engineering design and consulting fees and software development tools and related maintenance costs 
our personnel costs  including wages  taxes  benefits  recruitment and travel costs  also decreased from to  however these decreases were offset by increases in share based compensation expense 
we also experienced an increase in amortization costs related to our patents and licenses 
outside engineering design services are utilized to supplement our internal engineering resources and the related fees are generally project based and vary based on the magnitude and timing of those projects 
overall  these fees decreased from to by approximately  as a result of the completion of certain development programs late in  offset by new programs initiated in the second half of which were largely focused on the hedge development project 
software support and related maintenance costs decreased by approximately  from to as a result of re negotiation of fees with various software providers as part of our cost reduction measures implemented in late as well as changes in the software tools necessary to support our product designs 
research and development personnel expenses  excluding share based compensation  decreased approximately  from to this is primarily due to a decrease in cash incentive payments to employees  reduced travel expenses  and a reduction in recruiting costs 
this decrease was offset by an increase of  in our share based compensation expense for the same period 
the increase in share based compensation expense is a result of new equity awards to non executive employees to offset the impact of the reduced cash incentive programs  as well as the continued attribution of expense for engineering executive and other employee rsu awards made in our patent and license amortization cost increased from to by approximately  due to continued additions to our patent portfolio and the purchase of licenses in and related to our product development activities 
our research and development expenses increased approximately million  or  from to this increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs  including employee share based compensation expense  outside engineering design and consulting fees  prototype production costs  and software development tools and related maintenance costs 
from to  our charges for outside design services increased approximately  these increases were a result of projects that were largely completed by the end of software maintenance and support costs for engineering design software increased approximately  from to due to additional software tools and related maintenance costs required for ic design work 
from to  research and development personnel and related costs  excluding share based compensation expense  increased approximately  as a result of compensation increases for existing engineering staff  the addition of personnel  and increased travel expense  offset by decreases in cash incentive bonuses from to employee share based compensation increased by approximately  from to  primarily due to the noncash expense related to restricted shares and rsus issued to engineering executives and other employees in as long term incentive compensation and in lieu of cash incentive bonuses 
prototype ic production costs increased approximately  from to largely due to the addition of a second foundry  tsmc  for prototype runs 
we maintain a fairly regular cycle of prototype chip runs  however  the fabrication costs may vary from period to period based on the materials specified and the number of variants requested on each run 
the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
our ability to successfully develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new and enhanced products and technologies will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
although we anticipate decreases in our research and development expenses in  particularly with regard to outside design services  we are committed to continue investing in our technology and product development and therefore we anticipate that we will use a substantial portion of our working capital for research and development activities in marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease is primarily due to decreases in outside professional services and personnel and related expenses  partially offset by an increase in share based compensation 
outside professional services include various consulting and legal fees related to sales and marketing activities 
these fees decreased from to by approximately  as a result of a reduction in public relations and other technical marketing services rendered  coupled with a re negotiation of fees early in with certain sales consultants 
marketing and sales personnel costs  excluding share based compensation  decreased from to by approximately  primarily as a result of reduced employee head count  the elimination of cash incentive programs  and reduced travel expenses 
this was somewhat offset by an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately  for the same period as a result of new equity awards made to employees in to offset the impact of the elimination of the cash incentive program as well as the continued attribution of expense related to equity awards made in marketing and selling expenses decreased by approximately million or  from to this decrease was primarily due to decreases in personnel and related costs and non employee share based compensation  partially offset by an increase in employee share based compensation expense and outside professional services 
marketing and sales personnel costs  excluding share based compensation  decreased from to by approximately  primarily due to a reduction in employee cash bonuses  partially offset by increases in sales and marketing employee travel costs 
non employee share based compensation decreased approximately  from to primarily as a result of the reversal of previously recognized compensation expense on performance based options which expired unvested in these decreases were partially offset by increases in employee share based compensation expense of approximately  primarily due to the noncash expense related to rsus issued to sales and marketing executives and other employees in as long term incentive compensation 
in addition  fees for outside professional services increased from to by approximately  we are committed to continuing our investment in marketing and selling efforts in order to continue to increase market awareness and penetration of our products and technologies 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  finance and administrative personnel costs and costs incurred for insurance  shareholder relations and outside professional services 
our general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million  or  from to this decrease is due primarily to decreases in cash fees to outside directors along with decreases in corporate travel costs  outside professional fees  and insurance costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in share based compensation expense 
our outside director cash compensation decreased approximately  from to as a result of non employee directors waiving their cash director fees in favor of equity compensation for this decrease in directors cash fees was offset by an increase in share based compensation of approximately  from to the increase in share based compensation is a result of approximately  in share based compensation expense related to the value of nonqualified stock options issued to our non employee directors as payment for director and committee fees in in addition  we granted an aggregate of  share options to two outside consultants resulting in an increase in non employee share based compensation of approximately  our outside professional fees decreased by approximately  from to due to a reduction in outside legal services incurred for the period 
in addition  the cost of our directors and officers liability insurance decreased by approximately  from to due to general market conditions 
our corporate travel costs decreased approximately  from to due to specific measures taken to reduce costs  including the sale of a fractional ownership in an aircraft in january our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from to this increase was primarily due to increases in share based compensation expense partially offset by decreases in other personnel and related costs  insurance and corporate travel costs 
share based compensation expense increased approximately  from to  largely due to rsus issued to named executives and other employees in as long term incentive compensation 
our other personnel costs decreased approximately  from to primarily due to a reduction in cash incentive payments to named executives and other employees 
in addition  our corporate travel costs decreased approximately  from to and the cost of our directors and officers liability insurance decreased by approximately  from to due to general market conditions 
interest and other income interest and other income consist of interest earned on our investments  net gains recognized on the sale of investments  and other miscellaneous income 
interest and other income decreased approximately million from to and approximately million from to these decreases are primarily the result of declining interest rates due to market conditions and more conservative investments  as well as lower average cash balances during the respective periods 
interest expense interest expense represents interest incurred on capital lease obligations as well as interest incurred in connection with a state property tax filing in loss and loss per common share our net loss decreased approximately million  or per share  from to this decrease is primarily a result of a million  or  reduction in operating expenses along with a increase in weighted shares outstanding for the period 
our net loss increased by approximately million  or per share  from to this increase is primarily due to a million or increase in operating expenses  primarily related to research and development activities  offset by a increase in weighted average shares outstanding for the period 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of approximately million  which included million in cash and cash equivalents 
this represents an increase of approximately million over working capital of million at december  the increase in working capital is a result of approximately million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities in  less million used for operations and million used as payment for patents  licenses and fixed assets used in the business during our use of cash in was offset by million proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
at december   we were not subject to any significant commitments to make additional capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   we used cash of approximately for operations and million as payments for patent costs  licenses and fixed assets used in operations 
this cash usage was partially offset by million in proceeds from the march sale of equity securities and approximately million in proceeds received from the exercise of options and warrants in for the year ended december   we received approximately million in proceeds from the sale of equity securities and approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of approximately  options and warrants 
these proceeds were offset by the use of approximately million in cash for operating activities and approximately million for the purchase of property and equipment and for payment of patent costs in our future business plans call for continued investment in sales  marketing  customer support and product development for our technologies and products 
our ability to generate revenues sufficient to offset costs is subject to our ability to successfully support our customers in completing their initial product designs incorporating our technologies and our ability to secure a reasonable share of the market through additional product offerings with our current customers and or the addition of new customers 
we expect that revenue for will not be sufficient to cover our operational expenses for  and that our expected continued losses and use of cash will be funded from available working capital 
we assessed our short term liquidity needs based on the assumption that our working capital must be sufficient to cover our operational expenses for with an assumption of minimal revenue 
we expect our overall operating costs in will be less than those incurred in as a result of the elimination and or deferral of certain expenditures related to product development activities and other cost reduction measures implemented by us 
we believe our current capital resources and our cost reduction efforts will be sufficient to support our liquidity requirements through in the event that sufficient working capital is not available to meet our liquidity needs  we believe additional liquidity could be obtained through the surrender of key man life insurance policies for their cash value and or additional cost reduction measures 
in addition  we may be able to meet future liquidity needs through the issuance of equity securities under our outstanding shelf registration statements or through short or long term debt financing  although there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us 
we currently have no significant long term debt obligations 
the long term continuation of our business plan through and beyond is dependent upon the generation of sufficient revenues from our technologies and products to offset expenses 
in the event that we do not generate sufficient revenues  we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private financing and or further reduce operating costs 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital through debt or equity financings  and or further reduce operating costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long term business objectives 
off balance sheet transactions  arrangements and other relationships  contractual obligations as of december   we have outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock that were issued in connection with the sale of equity securities in various private placement transactions in    and these warrants have exercise prices ranging from to per share with a weighted average exercise price of and a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately years 
the estimated fair value of these warrants at their date of issuance of  is included in shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
during the year ended december   warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were exercised at a weighted average exercise price of  resulting in proceeds of  refer to non plan options warrants in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for information regarding the outstanding warrants

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market and economic conditions and is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which an asset trades 
our cash equivalents which are primarily comprised of highly liquid money market instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
we are averse to principal loss and seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting market risk
