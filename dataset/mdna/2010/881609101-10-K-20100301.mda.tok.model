business strategy and overview strategy and goals our strategy in our refining and marketing business is to create stockholder value in a global market with competitive returns in any economic environment through operating our facilities in a safe  reliable and environmentally responsible way  achieving greater operational and administrative efficiencies  and using cash flows from operations to create further shareholder value 
beginning in late  in response to declining refined product demand and refining industry margins  we began implementing initiatives to operate in a lower margin environment 
during  our goals were focused on lowering break even costs  gaining sustainable improvements in our capture of available margins and funding our capital program through operating cash flow 
relative to these goals  we achieved the following during improved our margin capture approximately million through various non capital initiatives including crude oil and feedstock optimization  product realization and refinery yield improvements  reduced our throughput and inventory to better match lower consumer demand  improved our cash balance million by decreasing inventories million barrels  reducing our capital spending million from a budget of million by adjusting project costs  scope and timing  and issuing million of senior notes  and funded our capital spending of million through cash flows from operations of million 
we expect the industry fundamentals in  namely lower refined product demand and excess refining capacity  will persist through consequently  we have developed a three year value creation plan designed to optimize our cash flows from operations by improving our capture of available margins  lowering our break even costs  lowering our energy and maintenance costs  and devoting capital to income improvement projects 
we have identified approximately high return capital projects that we can implement quickly to improve our economic position and create incremental shareholder value in the current low margin environment 
these projects focus on lowering our feedstock costs  improving clean product yields and reducing operating costs  including improving energy efficiency at all of our refineries 
the average cost per project for the majority of these projects is less than million 
we plan to spend approximately million in for these projects 
industry overview our profitability is heavily influenced by the cost of crude oil and the aggregate value of the products we make from that crude oil 
product values and crude oil costs are set by the market and are outside of the control of any refiner 
indexed models have been developed to meaningfully present the difference between these two values at an industry level  these industry refining margins provide benchmarks against which the performance of individual refiners can be evaluated 

table of contents the effects of the current economic recession  particularly the highest unemployment rate since  continued to negatively impact domestic refined product demand and drive up corresponding inventories 
this weak demand and high inventory levels  combined with rising crude oil prices  weakened industry refining margins during margins were further compromised by new global refining capacity and the increased supply of ethanol in the gasoline market 
prices for crude oil  in this case west texas intermediate  increased approximately during  from an average of per barrel during the first quarter to an average of per barrel during the fourth quarter 
this increase is attributed primarily to increased demand in the far east 
product values did not increase at a corresponding rate  however  due to poor demand and excess inventory 
average us west coast benchmark gasoline prices increased only and diesel fuel prices increased only from the first quarter to the fourth quarter of weak product demand drove us diesel fuel and jet fuel inventories to their highest levels since us west coast benchmark diesel margins averaged per barrel during  compared to per barrel during us demand for gasoline averaged near or below its five year average during  and gasoline inventories exceeded five year high levels during the fourth quarter 
although several refineries in the us were temporarily idled or permanently shut down during  decreased demand more than offset production losses and even drove down product imports 
refinery utilization fell to during  the lowest level since narrowing differentials between heavy and light crude oil prices also negatively impacted industry refining margins during for example  oriente crude a south american heavy crude oil traded for per barrel below alaska north slope crude a light crude oil compared to per barrel last year 
price differentials for heavy crude oil were reduced due in part to a lower supply of heavy crude oils from venezuela  mexico and the middle east and higher demand for heavy crude oil in china and india 
outlook while there have recently been signs of improvement in the us economy  the current global economic slowdown and high unemployment in the us are expected to continue to negatively impact demand for refined products 
the impact of reduced demand has been compounded by excess global refining capacity and historically high inventory levels 
these conditions have continued to put significant pressure on refined product margins in january and february until the economy recovers and unemployment declines  we expect margins to be negatively impacted 
as a result of the falling demand and excess refining capacity  several refineries in north america have been or are planned to be temporarily or permanently shutdown 
we are currently monitoring  and will continue to monitor  all of our refineries to assess whether a complete or partial shutdown of one or more of the facilities is appropriate until market conditions improve 
in addition to the current market conditions  there are long term factors that may impact the supply and demand of refined products in the us these factors include the increased mileage standards for vehicles  the mandated renewable fuels standards  proposed climate change legislation  the epa proposal to regulate greenhouse gases emissions under the clean air act and competing refineries being built overseas 
global financial markets we continue to remain attentive to current financial market conditions  including limited credit availability  even as we continue to see global financial markets improve 
while our ability to finance operations has not been impaired  there can be no assurance that there will not be a further deterioration in financial markets and confidence in major economies that could negatively impact us 

table of contents results of operations a discussion and analysis of the factors contributing to our results of operations is presented below 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item  together with the following information  are intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations  but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance 
our results include the operations of our los angeles refinery and shell and usa gasoline retail stations since acquisition in may summary our net loss in was million per diluted share compared with net earnings of million per diluted share in the decrease in net earnings of per diluted share was due primarily to the following significantly lower industry distillate margins primarily from reduced demand and excess inventories  the narrowing of price differentials between heavy and light crude oils  a lower lifo liquidation benefit of million  a goodwill impairment charge of million  the impact of scheduled and unscheduled downtime  and refunds received in totaling million in connection with our protest of intrastate pipeline rates 
the decrease in net earnings during relative to was partially offset by the following higher industry gasoline margins on the us west coast  reduced refining operating expenses of million primarily reflecting decreased utility costs and lower refining throughput  a million charge in to write off a receivable  lower losses on our derivative instruments of million  and improved retail operating income of million primarily due to lower impairment losses and operating expenses 
our net earnings for declined to million per diluted share from million per diluted share in the decline in net earnings of per diluted share was due primarily to the following substantially lower industry gasoline margins  higher operating expenses of million primarily reflecting increased utility expenses  a million charge to write off a receivable  the impact of rising crude oil prices on our derivative positions during the first half of resulting in higher losses of million year over year  and planned turnarounds of several units at our washington and golden eagle refineries during the decrease in net earnings during relative to was partially offset by the following a lifo liquidation resulting in a reduction to costs of sales of million  lower stock based and incentive compensation costs of million  refunds received in totaling million in connection with our protest of intrastate pipeline rates  initiatives implemented to improve our capture of available margins and match our yields to market demands including increasing the yield of distillate products  and increasing the use of heavy and sour crude oils  utilization of the golden eagle delayed coker  beginning in may  to capture yield improvements and increase our flexibility to use lower cost crude oil  and improved retail gross margins of million

during  we experienced reduced throughput due to scheduled turnarounds at the los angeles  golden eagle  and utah refineries 
compared to overview 
operating income for our refining segment decreased by million during the decrease primarily reflects a lower gross refining margin partially offset by lower operating expenses of million 
the impact of a lower per barrel gross refining margin decreased total gross refining margins by million during the year 
operating income included a goodwill impairment charge at our washington refinery of million during and a charge of million during to write off a receivable for which collection was deemed unlikely 
our operating income in both periods benefited from a reduction in costs of sales by decreasing lifo inventory layers acquired at lower per barrel costs 
these inventory reductions resulted in operating income improvements of million during and million during gross refining margins 
our gross refining margin per barrel decreased to per barrel in due to significantly lower industry diesel fuel and jet fuel margins  partially offset by higher industry margins for gasoline and heavy products 
the decrease in industry diesel fuel margins throughout reflects lower global demand and significantly higher us inventories 
industry gasoline margins on the us west coast improved in as compared to primarily due to heavy industry downtime during the first quarter  unscheduled industry downtime during the third quarter and lower average gasoline inventories 
we also benefited from lower differentials on heavy products  such as fuel oil 
fuel oil prices averaged approximately of the alaska north slope ans crude oil price during versus approximately during our california region was negatively impacted by a reduction of price differentials between heavy and light crude oils that reduced gross refining margin during our california refineries run a high proportion of heavy crude oils of total refining throughput during 
see industry overview for additional information on the decrease in industry refining margins during we periodically use derivative instruments to primarily manage exposure to commodity price risks associated with the purchase or sale of crude oil and finished products 
we may also use derivative instruments to manage price risks associated with inventories above or below our target levels 
gains or losses associated with our derivative instruments are included in gross refining margin 
our losses totaled million during versus million during the decrease in our losses reflects the impact of changing our hedging strategy 
during the second quarter  we closed the majority of our crude oil derivative positions associated with our long haul strategy that matched the price of long haul crude oils to crude oil prices at the day of processing 
we continue to monitor our hedging strategy in 
table of contents refining throughput 
total refining throughput declined thousand barrels per day mbpd during primarily due to matching production to lower demand and the following a refinery wide turnaround and other unscheduled downtime at the alaska refinery during the second quarter  a refinery wide shutdown for repair of the crude tower at the washington refinery from mid january to mid february  unscheduled maintenance of the delayed coker and hydrocracker at the golden eagle refinery during the third quarter and a turnaround of the hydrocracker at the golden eagle refinery in the second quarter  and unscheduled downtime of the delayed coker at the los angeles refinery primarily during the fourth quarter 
total refining throughput during was impacted by turnarounds at our golden eagle and washington refineries 
refined products sales 
revenues from sales of refined products decreased to billion in as compared to  primarily due to significantly lower average refined product sales prices and lower refined product sales volumes 
our average product sales price decreased to per barrel in reflecting lower product demand and lower average crude oil prices 
total refined product sales decreased by or mbpd from  primarily reflecting lower product demand 
costs of sales and expenses 
our average costs of sales decreased to per barrel during reflecting significantly lower average crude oil prices 
manufacturing and other operating expenses decreased to billion in  compared to billion in  primarily reflecting lower natural gas utility costs and refining throughput 
depreciation and amortization increased by million during reflecting the completion of several capital projects during  including the million delayed coker unit at the golden eagle refinery 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative costs of million from is due to a million charge to write off a receivable a year ago 
the increase in loss on asset disposals and impairments primarily reflects a goodwill impairment of million and a net termination charge of million related to cancelling the purchase of equipment associated with a capital project at our los angeles refinery 
the equipment purchase was cancelled as we reevaluated the scope and timing of the project 
compared to overview 
operating income for our refining segment decreased by million during primarily due to a lower gross refining margin and increased operating expenses 
a lower per barrel gross refining margin reduced our total gross refining margins by million during operating income in included a million charge to write off a receivable and a lifo liquidation benefit of million 
the lifo liquidation resulted from a reduction in petroleum inventories by decreasing lifo layers acquired at lower per barrel costs 
gross refining margins 
our gross refining margin per barrel decreased to per barrel in  reflecting significantly lower industry gasoline margins 
us west coast benchmark gasoline margins were down from an average of per barrel in to an average of per barrel in as a result of rapidly rising crude oil prices during the first half of and weakening product demand 
during the second half of  however  crude oil prices declined primarily due to declining global crude oil demand 
the rapid decline in crude oil prices resulted in slightly improved refining margins during the last six months of versus the prior year as product prices declined more gradually 
weaker industry gasoline margins were partially offset by higher diesel fuel margins in reflecting strong global demand and low inventories 
industry margins were higher in due to robust market fundamentals during the first half of the year  including strong demand for refined products  low refinery utilization  low products inventories and the introduction of new lower sulfur requirements for non road diesel fuel which began in june heavy industry turnaround activity and unscheduled downtime on the us west coast benefited our gross refining margins during the first half of our gross refining margin was also negatively impacted during due to the rapid increase in crude oil prices during the first half of resulting in increased losses on our derivative positions of million year over year 

table of contents refining throughput 
during both and  total refining throughput averaged mbpd 
excluding the los angeles refinery acquired in may  throughput decreased by mbpd primarily reflecting throughput reductions at our alaska  hawaii and washington refineries to match production to demand and a turnaround of five major units at our golden eagle refinery from mid march through april and a turnaround of the fluid catalytic cracker and alkylation units at our washington refinery from late january to mid february 
during  total refining throughput was reduced by scheduled turnarounds at our los angeles  golden eagle and utah refineries and unscheduled downtime at our golden eagle and washington refineries 
refined product sales 
revenues from sales of refined products increased to billion in as compared to  primarily due to significantly higher average refined product sales prices and increased refined product sales volumes 
our average refined product sales price increased to per barrel in  as higher average crude oil prices put upward pressure on product prices 
total refined product sales volumes increased reflecting additional sales volumes from operating our los angeles refinery for a full year in excluding the los angeles refinery  total refined product sales volumes decreased by mbpd reflecting declining product demand 
costs of sales and expenses 
our average costs of sales increased to per barrel during  reflecting the significant increase in average crude oil prices during the year 
manufacturing and other operating expenses increased to billion in  compared with billion in  with million of the increase incurred by the los angeles refinery

we did not earn other income during or 
table of contents income tax provision the income tax benefit amounted to million in compared to a provision of million in and million in the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were  and in  and  respectively 
the tax rate was lower primarily due to a million impairment of goodwill for which there was no corresponding tax basis 
the tax rate benefited from the favorable settlement of federal tax audits for the years through capital resources and liquidity overview we operate in an environment where our capital resources and liquidity are impacted by changes in the price of crude oil and refined products  availability of trade credit  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
these factors include the level of consumer demand for transportation fuels  weather conditions  fluctuations in seasonal demand  governmental regulations  geo political conditions and overall market and global economic conditions 
see important information regarding forward looking statements on page for further information related to risks and other factors 
future capital expenditures  as well as borrowings under our credit agreement and other sources of capital  may be affected by these conditions 
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations and borrowing availability under revolving lines of credit 
we ended with million of cash and cash equivalents  no borrowings under our revolver  and approximately billion in available borrowing capacity under our credit agreement after million in outstanding letters of credit 
at december   we also had three separate letter of credit agreements with a total capacity of million  of which we had million available after million in outstanding letters of credit 
our total capacity of billion under the credit agreement can be increased up to a total capacity of billion 
we can also increase capacity under our separate letter of credit agreements 
our available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement was temporarily reduced as of february  as the standard reserve  as defined  increased from million to million as a result of not meeting the fixed charge coverage ratio 
based on the fixed charge coverage ratio  our total capacity as of february  was billion before outstanding letters of credit of million 
the amount of available borrowing capacity fluctuates and is based on a periodically adjusted borrowing base consisting of our eligible cash and cash equivalents  receivables and petroleum inventories  net of the standard reserve 
in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due for general corporate purposes 
excluding proceeds from the notes issuance  we increased our cash position by million at december  from a year ago 
we believe available capital resources will be adequate to meet our capital expenditure  working capital and debt service requirements 
due to the current unfavorable economic conditions in the refining industry  we continue to focus on our available cash through the management of working capital  capital expenditures and operating expenses 
however  if industry refining margins were to remain depressed for an extended period of time  we may be required to materially alter our operations which could include deferring capital expenditures  selling assets or temporarily idling one or more of our refineries 
we may also seek to increase our available cash through the capital markets 
in february  we suspended our quarterly cash dividend indefinitely to preserve cash and maintain a strong balance sheet as we expect further refining margin volatility 
this action also provides us flexibility to allocate capital to our quick return capital projects which we believe will deliver the highest shareholder return in a low margin environment 
during  we paid cash dividends on common stock of per share totaling million 
our million senior notes were issued at of face value at an effective interest rate of 
the notes have a ten year maturity with no sinking fund requirements and are subject to optional redemption by tesoro beginning june  at premiums of through may   from june  through may   from june  through may   and at par thereafter 
we have the right to redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount at of face value with proceeds from certain equity issuances through june  the indenture for the notes contains covenants and restrictions that are customary for notes of this nature 
substantially all of these covenants will terminate before the notes mature if one of two specified ratings agencies assigns the notes an investment grade rating and no events of default exist under the indenture

the indentures for our senior notes contain covenants and restrictions which are customary for notes of this nature 
these covenants and restrictions limit  among other things  our ability to pay dividends and other distributions with respect to our capital stock and purchase  redeem or retire our capital stock  incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock  sell assets unless the proceeds from those sales are used to repay debt or are reinvested in our business  incur liens on assets to secure certain debt  engage in certain business activities  engage in certain merger or consolidations and transfers of assets  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the indentures also limit our subsidiaries ability to make certain payments and distributions 
credit agreement revolving credit facility in february and may  we amended our credit agreement  which among other things  modified the following lowered the minimum tangible net worth requirement  as defined  the purchase or sale of certain assets is no longer subject to the fixed charge coverage ratio test  the covenant permitting additional unsecured indebtedness  as defined  increased from million to million  letters of credit allowed under separate letter of credit agreements  previously capped at million  are no longer subject to a cap  the applicable margin  as defined  and the annual rate of commitment fees changed from to in may and to in february for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 

table of contents at december   our credit agreement provided for borrowings including letters of credit up to the lesser of the amount of a periodically adjusted borrowing base of approximately billion based upon an alaska north slope crude oil price of per barrel  consisting of tesoro s eligible cash and cash equivalents  receivables and petroleum inventories  net of the standard reserve as defined  or the agreement s total capacity of billion 
the capacity can be further increased up to billion 
as of december   we had no borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement  resulting in total unused credit availability of billion or of the eligible borrowing base 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at either a base rate at december   or a eurodollar rate at december  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin at december  was in the case of the eurodollar rate  but varies based upon our credit facility availability and credit ratings 
letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility incur fees at an annual rate tied to the applicable margin described above at december  
our credit agreement expires in may the credit agreement contains covenants and conditions that  among other things  limit our ability to pay cash dividends  incur indebtedness  create liens and make investments 
tesoro is also required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and specified levels of tangible net worth 
we satisfied all of the financial covenants under the credit agreement for the year ended december  the credit agreement is guaranteed by substantially all of tesoro s active domestic subsidiaries 
the credit agreement allows up to million of restricted payments during any four quarter period subject to credit availability exceeding of the borrowing base 
letter of credit agreements the credit agreement allows us to obtain letters of credit under separate letter of credit agreements for foreign crude oil purchases 
at december   our letters of credit capacity under these three agreements totaled million  of which million was outstanding 
letters of credit outstanding under these agreements incur fees and are secured by the petroleum inventories supported by the issued letters of credit 
the agreements may be terminated by either party  at any time 
cash flow summary components of our cash flows are set forth below in millions cash flows from used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash from operating activities decreased to million in primarily due to less cash earnings  partially offset by lower working capital requirements 
net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily for capital expenditures 
net cash from financing activities primarily reflects the net proceeds from our senior notes issuance partially offset by repayments on our revolver and dividend payments 
gross borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled million  and we repaid million in borrowings during working capital excluding cash decreased million at december  from million at december   as payables increased  due to higher crude oil prices at year end  by a larger amount than both receivables and inventories 
inventories decreased by approximately million barrels from december  reflecting our initiatives to optimize working capital and the impact of matching production to lower product demand 
net cash from operating activities decreased during to million primarily due to lower cash earnings and higher working capital requirements reflecting significantly lower payables associated with falling crude oil prices at year end 
net cash used in investing activities of million in was primarily for capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflects payments under our revolver and dividend payments of million 
gross borrowings under our revolving credit agreement totaled billion  and we repaid billion in borrowings during working capital excluding cash totaled million at december  compared to million at december   primarily reflecting lower payables  partially offset by decreased receivables and inventories 
payables and receivables decreased due to the lower prices of crude oil and refined products 
receivables decreased less than payables as a result of product prices lagging sharply falling crude oil prices 
inventories decreased from year end due in part to our efforts to reduce inventories

refinery turnaround spending we expect to spend approximately million for refinery turnarounds and catalyst in the turnaround spending is primarily at our utah refinery during the first quarter  our north dakota refinery during the second quarter and our hawaii refinery during the third quarter 
refining throughput and yields in will be affected by these turnarounds 
during  we spent million for refinery turnarounds and catalyst  primarily at our golden eagle  alaska and los angeles refineries 
long term commitments contractual commitments we have numerous contractual commitments for purchases associated with the operation of our refineries  debt service and leases see notes j and n in our consolidated financial statements in item 
we also have minimum contractual spending requirements for certain capital projects 
the following table summarizes our annual contractual commitments as of december  in millions contractual obligation thereafter long term debt obligations a capital lease obligations b operating lease obligations b crude oil supply obligations c other purchase obligations d capital expenditure obligations total contractual obligations a includes maturities of principal and interest payments  excluding capital lease obligations 
amounts and timing may be different from our estimated commitments due to potential voluntary debt prepayments and borrowings 
b capital lease obligations include amounts classified as interest 
operating lease obligations represent our future minimum noncancellable lease commitments 
operating lease commitments for include lease arrangements with initial terms of less than one year  and are not reduced by minimum rentals to be received by us under subleases 
c represents an estimate of our contractual purchase commitments for crude oil  with remaining terms ranging from year to years 
prices under these term agreements generally fluctuate due to market responsive pricing provisions 
to estimate our annual commitments under these contracts  we estimated crude oil prices using actual market prices as of december   ranging by crude oil type from per barrel to per barrel  and volumes based on the contract s minimum purchase requirements 
we also purchase additional crude oil under short term renewable contracts and in the spot market  which are not included in the table above 
d represents primarily long term commitments for the transportation of crude oil and to purchase industrial gases  chemical processing services and utilities at our refineries 
these purchase obligations are based on the contract s minimum volume requirements 

table of contents in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities  million of which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet 
with the exception of amounts classified as current liabilities  we are uncertain as to when such amounts may be settled 
related to these unrecognized tax benefits  we have also recorded a liability for potential interest and penalties of million at december   million of which is classified as current in the consolidated balance sheet 
see note l in our consolidated financial statements in item for further information 
off balance sheet arrangements other than our leasing arrangements described in note n to our consolidated financial statements  we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off balance sheet liabilities 
environmental and other matters we are a party to various litigation and contingent loss situations  including environmental and income tax matters  arising in the ordinary course of business 
even though we cannot predict the ultimate outcomes of these matters with certainty  we have accrued for these outcomes based on our best estimates 
we believe that the outcome of these matters will not materially impact our liquidity and consolidated financial position  although the resolution of certain of these matters could have a material impact on interim or annual results of operations 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these laws  which change frequently  regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and may require us to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of petroleum or chemical substances at various sites  install additional controls  or make other modifications to certain emission sources 
future expenditures may be required to comply with the clean air act and other federal  state and local requirements for our various sites  including our refineries  tank farms  pipelines  operating and closed retail stations and operating and closed refined products terminals 
the impact of these legislative and regulatory developments  if enacted or adopted  could result in increased compliance costs  additional operating restrictions on our business  and an increase in the cost of or reduced demand for products we manufacture  all of which could have an adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations  and liquidity 
in december  the us congress passed the energy independence and security act that created a second renewable fuels standard rfs 
this standard requires the total volume of renewable transportation fuels including ethanol and advanced biofuels sold or introduced in the us to reach billion gallons in and rise to billion gallons by the requirements could reduce future demand growth for petroleum products that we manufacture 
in the near term  the rfs presents ethanol production and logistics challenges for the ethanol  alternative fuel and refining and marketing industries which may require additional expenditures to logistically accommodate the increased use of renewable transportation fuels 
in california  assembly bill ab  created a statewide cap on greenhouse gas emissions and requires that the state return to emission levels by ab focuses on using market mechanisms  such as a cap and trade program and a low carbon fuel standard lcfs to achieve emission reduction targets 
the lcfs became effective in january and requires a reduction in the carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel fuel by final regulations for all other aspects of ab  including cap and trade requirements  are being developed by the california air resources board  will take effect in and will be fully implemented by the implementation and implications of ab will take many years to realize  and we cannot currently predict its impact on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
in  the us environmental protection agency proposed regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act 
the proposed regulations may be finalized in and include proposed standards for the control of greenhouse gas emissions from light trucks and cars which could reduce the demand for transportation fuels we manufacture 
in addition  the proposed regulations include permitting requirements for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases above a certain threshold 
the resulting permitting requirements could impose emission controls which could require material capital expenditures at our refineries 
also in  the us house of representatives passed legislation seeking to establish a national cap and trade program beginning in to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change 
the legislation as proposed would materially increase our cost of compliance  however  the us senate failed to pass similar legislation and we believe it will not do so in 
table of contents we are subject to audits by federal  state and local taxing authorities in the normal course of business 
it is possible that tax audits could result in claims against us in excess of recorded liabilities 
we believe that when these matters are resolved they will not materially affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we believe it is reasonably possible that unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by as much as million in the next twelve months through settlements or other conclusions  primarily regarding state tax issues 
we are also subject to extensive federal  state and local tax laws and regulations 
new tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future 
environmental liabilities we are currently  and expect to continue  incurring expenses for environmental cleanup at a number of currently and previously owned or operated refining  pipeline  terminal and retail station properties 
we have accrued liabilities for these expenses and believe these accruals are adequate 
however  our environmental liabilities are based on estimates including engineering assessments and it is reasonably possible that our estimates will change and that additional remediation costs will be incurred as more information becomes available 
we received million in a settlement with a prior owner of our golden eagle refinery in in exchange for assuming responsibility for certain environmental liabilities arising from operations at the refinery prior to august these environmental liabilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we cannot presently determine the additional remedial activities that may be required at the golden eagle refinery 
therefore  it is reasonably possible that we will incur additional remediation costs as more information becomes available 
we expect to file insurance claims under environmental insurance policies that provide coverage up to million for expenditures in excess of the settlement proceeds 
amounts recorded for environmental liabilities have not been reduced for possible insurance recoveries 
we are continuing to investigate conditions at certain active wastewater treatment units at our golden eagle refinery 
this investigation is driven by an order from the san francisco bay regional water quality control board that names us as well as two previous owners of the golden eagle refinery 
costs to investigate these conditions are included in our environmental accruals 
we cannot currently estimate the amount of the ultimate resolution of the order but we believe it will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
other matters in the ordinary course of business  we become party to lawsuits  administrative proceedings and governmental investigations  including environmental  regulatory and other matters 
large and sometimes unspecified damages or penalties may be sought from us in some matters for which the likelihood of loss may be reasonably possible but the amount of loss is not currently estimable 
as a result  we have not established reserves for these matters and the matters described below 
we believe that the resolution of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on february   the epa filed suit against us alleging violations of the clean air act and corresponding regulatory requirements concerning the testing and reporting of transportation fuels and fuel additives 
in february  we received a notice of violation nov from the epa for the alleged violations arising from a compliance review conducted by the epa in for the years through the time of the review in we are evaluating the alleged violations contained in the suit 
we are a defendant  along with other manufacturing  supply and marketing defendants  in five lawsuits alleging mtbe contamination in ground water 
the defendants are being sued for having manufactured mtbe and having manufactured  supplied and distributed gasoline containing mtbe 
the plaintiffs in the five cases  all in california  are municipalities and governmental authorities 
the plaintiffs allege  in part  that the defendants are liable for manufacturing or distributing a defective product 
the suits generally seek individual  unquantified compensatory and punitive damages and attorney s fees 
we intend to vigorously assert our defenses against these claims 

table of contents prior to this year  we received two novs from the epa for the washington refinery alleging that prior to our acquisition of the refinery  certain modifications were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in violation of the clean air act 
we have investigated the allegations and believe we have defenses to the allegations and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
prior to this year  we received a nov from the epa concerning our utah refinery alleging certain violations of the clean air act at the refinery beginning in we have investigated the allegations contained in the nov and sent the epa additional information in during  chevron filed a lawsuit against us claiming they are entitled to a share of the refunds we received in from the owners of the trans alaska pipeline system taps 
we received million in  net of contingent legal fees  for excessive intrastate rates charged by taps during though  and the period of through june chevron is asserting that it is entitled to a share of its portion of the refunds approximately million as retroactive price adjustments under our previous crude oil contracts with them 
in december  the trial court judge issued an order supporting chevron s claim to receive a share of the refunds 
we disagree with  and are challenging the order 
the exact amount of refunds subject to the order has not been determined  and some uncertainty remains about the scope of the order 
environmental capital expenditures the epa issued regulations in february that require the reduction of benzene in gasoline 
we spent million in  and plan to spend an additional million through at five of our refineries to comply with the regulations 
our california refineries will not require capital spending to meet the benzene reduction standards 
these cost estimates are subject to further review and analysis 
regulations issued by california s south coast air quality management district require the emission of nitrogen oxides to be reduced through at our los angeles refinery 
currently  we plan to meet this requirement by implementing operational changes and a portfolio of small capital projects 
other projects at our los angeles refinery include replacing underground pipelines with above ground pipelines to comply with an order from the california regional water quality control board 
we spent million in  and expect to spend an additional million through to complete the project 
we completed installing equipment at our golden eagle refinery in february to eliminate the use of atmospheric blowdown towers as emergency relief systems 
we spent million in  and we expect to spend million in  primarily for an additional project to eliminate a blowdown tower at our north dakota refinery 
we will spend additional capital at our golden eagle refinery for reconfiguring and replacing above ground storage tank systems 
we spent million in  and expect to spend an additional million through for this project 
we are evaluating alternative projects for wharves at our golden eagle refinery to meet engineering and maintenance standards issued by the state of california in february these projects could cost between million and million through the timing of these projects is being evaluated and is subject to change 
we are required under a consent decree with the epa to reduce air emissions at our north dakota and utah refineries 
we spent million in and expect to spend an additional million in to install nox emission controls on boilers and heaters at these refineries 
we plan to meet the requirements in the cost estimates for the environmental projects described above are subject to further review and analysis and include estimates for capitalized interest and labor costs 
pension funding we provide a qualified defined benefit retirement plan for all eligible employees  with benefits based on years of service and compensation 
our long term expected return on plan assets is  and our funded employee pension plan assets experienced a gain of million in and a loss of million in based on a discount rate and fair values of plan assets as of december   the fair values of the assets in our funded employee pension plan were equal to approximately of the projected benefit obligation as of the end of at january  the adjusted funding target attainment percentage a funding measure defined under applicable pension regulations was 
although tesoro had no minimum required contribution obligation to its funded 
table of contents employee pension plan under applicable laws and regulations in  we voluntarily contributed million to improve the funded status of the plan 
we have no minimum required contribution to our pension plan under applicable laws and regulations 
future contributions are affected by returns on plan assets  employee demographics and other factors
