item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our company  kaydon corporation  is a leading designer and manufacturer of custom engineered  performance critical products  supplying a broad and diverse group of alternative energy  industrial  aerospace  medical and electronic equipment  and aftermarket customers 
demand for our products depends  in part  upon a wide range of general economic conditions  which affect our markets in varying ways from year to year 
the global recessionary conditions that impacted the economy during the second half of and throughout reduced demand for our products and resulted in sales volume and operating margin declines in each of our business segments 
these adverse macroeconomic conditions resulted in customers acting with caution  which led to a decline in orders and requests for deferred delivery of our product 
in response to these conditions  we have focused  and will continue to focus  on programs to grow market share  reduce costs and improve capacity utilization  and increase cash flow  thereby positioning us to capitalize on future opportunities in targeted markets when conditions improve 
while worldwide business conditions remain very challenging  our industrial markets appear to have stabilized  albeit at cyclically low levels 
while we are confident in our strategic positioning in each of our markets  meaningful improvements in will be dependent on an improved economy resulting in a resumption of higher order rates in our core industrial end markets 
because of our diverse product offerings and served markets  as well as the general uncertainty as to the timing and nature of any economic recovery  the specific impact of these economic conditions on our operating results is difficult to predict 
with respect to the wind energy market  while growth continued in  the longer term outlook will be heavily influenced by both an improved economy  and resultant need for electricity  and greater clarity on the public policy front 
we believe that recent actions and policy statements regarding a sustained  committed policy towards increasing renewable energy usage in the united states supports the confidence we have in our investment in this market 
during our net sales totaled million with increased wind energy sales being more than offset by the adverse effects of the worldwide recession on our remaining businesses 
we generated net income of million  and cash flow from operating activities of million during due to the strong cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents increased million during the year even as we invested million in capital expenditures  million for stock repurchases  million to fund our qualified pension plans  and increased our common stock dividend 
the total order book for equaled million  compared to in  and million in  with the decrease reflecting the macroeconomic downturn 
our year end backlog of million provides a foundation for operating performance in  however  orders for our industrial products will continue to be impacted by the timing and nature of any economic recovery 
our investable balances provided significant interest income in and early before financial markets deteriorated 
we responded to these adverse financial market conditions in and with an investment strategy focused on preserving cash balances 
market interest rates on these investments are now near zero percent 
as a result  our returns on our investable balances were relatively insignificant in and will not improve significantly until market rates increase 
during we completed our wind energy capacity expansion program  which provides us with the flexibility to respond to customer requirements when markets improve 
in  all of our million contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due  the notes were converted into shares of our common stock  which made us debt free 
at december   our current ratio was to and working capital totaled million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents balance of million at december   and future cash flows from operations  along with our borrowing capacity are adequate to fund our strategies for future growth  including working capital  expenditures for capital expansion and efficiencies  selected stock repurchases  market share initiatives and corporate development efforts 
in summary  our future performance will be impacted by general economic conditions and the strength or weakness of the manufacturing kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents environment  the success of our efforts to continue to expand operations and improve operating efficiencies  as well as the use of available cash and borrowing capacity for future acquisitions 
the discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report to assist in understanding our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  capital structure and other relevant financial information 
selected data for the years  and for the years ended december  of of of sales sales sales in thousands  except per share amounts results from operations net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income net income earnings per share diluted analysis of operations compared to operations net sales net sales for equaled million  a decrease of million or percent  compared to net sales in of million 
during  the decline in net sales was primarily attributable to a decrease in volume of million  or percent  compared to  as sales gains to wind energy customers of million or percent were more than offset by the adverse impact of the global economic recession on all our reporting segments and all our other significant end markets 
the adverse effects of changes in currency exchange rates had an million  or percent  unfavorable impact on sales 
this decrease was principally attributable to a stronger us dollar relative to the euro and british pound on a year over year basis 
finally  net improved pricing yielded an increase of million for the year 
pricing changes were favorable in the first half of primarily as a result of price increases on our core products  and were lower in the second half of the year primarily due to contractual adjustments associated with the contractual pass through of decreased material costs 
gross margin gross margin in was percent  a decrease of points from the percent gross margin in the decreased sales volume and higher unabsorbed fixed costs associated with lower production volumes accounted for points of the decline in gross margin  and is largely due to the global economic downturn  partially offset by the impact of cost reduction efforts implemented across all our businesses 
unfavorable changes in product mix accounted for an additional points of the decline due to reduced sales volume to higher margin industrial markets and increased sales volume to the wind energy market  where margins are not as high 
pricing had a favorable impact of point on gross margin  primarily attributable to favorable selling price increases in the first half of selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or percent of sales  in  compared to million  or percent of sales  in during  we recorded curtailment gains totaling million that were associated with changes to certain postretirement benefit plans 
the remaining decrease is primarily attributable to the preemptive and continuing steps that have been taken throughout the year to reduce discretionary costs across all reporting segments as kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents a result of lower sales volume  partially offset by approximately million of one time expenses associated with layoffs and related severance in operating income our operating income was million  or percent of sales  in  compared to million  or percent of sales  in the decrease in gross profit more than offset the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest income during  interest income totaled million on average investment balances of million as interest rates were negligible for most of the year 
this compares to million of interest income in when we earned approximately percent on average investment balances of million 
the decrease in average investment balances resulted from investments in our capital expenditure program  increased working capital  contributions to our qualified pension plans  the use of cash for our stock repurchase program  and an increase in our dividend rate 
the decrease in average interest rates in reflects our conservative investment strategy to preserve cash balances in response to financial market conditions and prevailing historically low interest rates on short term treasury securities 
interest rates for are expected to show only modest improvement 
interest expense during  interest expense totaled million and represented amortization of credit facility costs 
during  interest expense totaled million 
the year over year difference of million is attributable to interest and amortization of issuance costs associated with the notes that were outstanding in the prior year  including a million adjustment of interest and amortization costs associated with the retrospective application of new accounting guidance effective january  provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in the effective tax rate for is expected to decrease from the level in due to the impact of tax credits and lower income taxes on foreign earnings 
net income net income for was million or per share on a diluted basis  which included the million  or per share  after tax gain associated with the curtailment of certain postretirement benefits  based on approximately million common shares outstanding 
net income for totaled million or per share on a diluted basis  based on approximately million common shares outstanding 
the results have been adjusted to reflect the required retrospective application of new accounting guidance related to convertible debt and earnings per share  which were effective january   and reduced previously reported net income by million and diluted earnings per share by 
analysis of operations compared to operations net sales net sales of million in increased million or percent compared to net sales in of million 
the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in sales from our wind energy initiative and increased sales of million from the inclusion of a full year of sales from the avon acquisition  which includes million of increased wind energy sales  and million in increased sales of velocity control products 
gross margin gross margin for was percent  a decrease of points from the percent for the lower gross margin was due to the combined effects of product mix shifts  the incurrence of costs to ramp up our wind energy expansion  and the inclusion of avon for which gross margins are not as high as the company average 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million and equaled percent of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses in totaled million  which included a million positive effect of the gain on the sale of a component of the friction control products kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents reporting segment  and equaled percent of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during in support of increased sales  particularly for the expansion of the company s sales force  and due to increased intangible amortization expense associated with the avon acquisition 
operating income operating income totaled million or percent of sales compared to million or percent of sales during  including the aforementioned million gain 
interest income interest income declined to million in compared to million in the decline was due to substantially lower market interest rates  which on average were approximately basis points lower than in the company also had lower average cash and short term investment balances due to investments in property  plant  and equipment for capacity expansion  share repurchases  pension contributions  and increased dividend payments 
in addition  during  the company incurred losses totaling million  which were recorded as a reduction to interest income 
interest expense during  million of interest and amortization of issuance costs was charged to interest expense related to our then outstanding million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes the notes  which were converted into shares of our common stock in the third quarter of in  million of interest and amortization of issuance costs related to the notes was charged to interest expense 
the retrospective application of new accounting guidance adopted  as required  on january   increased previously reported interest expense by million and million for and  respectively 
provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent compared to percent in net income our net income for totaled million or per share on a diluted basis  based on approximately million common shares outstanding 
net income for  which included a million  or per share  after tax gain on the sale of a component of a reporting segment  was million or per share on a diluted basis  based on approximately million common shares outstanding 
the retrospective application of new accounting guidance  adopted  as required  on january   reduced previously reported net income and diluted earnings per share by million and per share on a diluted basis  respectively 
the application of this new accounting guidance reduced previously reported net income and diluted earnings per share by million and per share on a diluted basis  respectively 
results by business segment we classify our businesses into three reporting segments friction control products  velocity control products  and sealing products 
our remaining operating segments are combined and disclosed as other businesses 
the segment discussions that follow describe the significant factors contributing to the changes in results for each segment 
the aforementioned curtailment gains resulting from changes to our postretirement benefit plans  which total million in  were not allocated to our operating segments 
friction control products for the years ended december  change change to to dollars in millions sales operating income operating margin kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents compared to sales in our friction control products reporting segment were million during compared to million in  reflecting a decrease of million or percent 
excluding sales gains to wind energy customers of million  sales to all other markets in decreased by million from this decline was due to the effects of volume declines of approximately million associated with adverse economic conditions impacting industrial markets and an adverse currency exchange rate impact of million which offset a million benefit from increased pricing 
operating income from the friction control products reporting segment during totaled million compared to million in the million decrease in operating income was due to a million adverse effect of lower sales volumes  a million adverse effect of product mix resulting from lower sales to higher margin industrial markets  and a million decrease resulting from higher costs net of cost saving initiatives and pricing gains 
the higher costs include increased depreciation associated with our investment in capacity to support the wind energy growth initiative  increased pension expense  and severance and redundancy cost incurred during compared to in  sales in our friction control products reporting segment were million  an increase of million or percent compared to sales of million 
sales of custom engineered bearings to the wind energy market increased million  to the military market increased million  to the medical market increased million  and to the heavy equipment market increased million 
sales of split roller bearings increased million compared to sales to the machinery market declined million  sales to the specialty electronics market declined million  and sales to other markets declined million compared to the the inclusion of a full year of avon sales accounted for million of the aforementioned million sales increase 
operating income from the friction control products reporting segment was million during as compared to million during the lower operating margin of percent in compared to percent in is the result of the mix impact of increased wind energy sales and the inclusion of a full year of avon sales  as both carry margins that are not as high as those in our core industrial business 
additionally  operating income was lower than in due to the million gain on the sale of a component of this reporting segment that was recorded in velocity control products for the years ended december  change change to to dollars in millions sales operating income operating margin compared to during  sales in our velocity control products reporting segment were million compared to million in the decrease of million was due to a decline in volume of million caused by decreased demand in worldwide markets for gas springs  hydraulic dampers  and other products  especially in industrial markets  and the adverse effects of changes in currency exchange rates of approximately million 
the velocity control products reporting segment contributed million to our operating income during compared to million during this decrease in operating income is principally due to the effect of the decline in sales volume and adverse effects of exchange rate changes of approximately million and million  respectively 
this decrease was partially offset by net cost reduction savings of million 
compared to the velocity control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million  reflecting a million impact of favorable currency exchange rate changes  kaydon corporation form k

liquidity and capital resources at december   our current ratio was to and working capital totaled million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
at december  our current ratio was to and working capital totaled million  including cash and cash equivalents of million 
we have historically generated significant cash flows from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  dividends and other operating requirements 
cash flow generation has been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies  implement cost reductions  and manage working capital requirements 
net cash from operating activities equaled million in  million in  and million in despite difficult economic conditions  net cash from operating activities increased in compared to as reduced investments in working capital more than offset the adverse impact of decreased net income 
net cash from operating activities in declined compared to as decreased net income and increased investment in working capital associated with sales growth more than offset the benefits of decreased contributions to our qualified pension plans 
net inventories at december  were million  a decrease of million from the million of inventory at december  the decrease was principally attributable to the overall decline in sales volumes as inventory turns were consistent on a year over year basis 
net inventories at december  increased million from the december  balance of million 
the inventory increase was attributable to sales growth and our investment in inventory to supply bearings to wind energy turbine manufacturers 
in considering both our long term confidence in the wind energy market and our ongoing strategic relationships with wind energy customers  we have made significant investments in support of this initiative 
we closely monitor our accounts receivable from wind energy customers and are reasonably assured that our accounts receivable are fully collectible 
additionally  we believe that our inventory as of december  is fully realizable 
as such we have not established any reserve for inventory or any allowance for doubtful accounts related to wind energy customers as of december  at december   we had approximately million of working capital invested on behalf of an international wind energy customer  including past due accounts receivable and inventory and purchase commitments made or incurred on the customer s behalf and designed to its agreed upon specifications 
the customer has not paid us because the customer alleges that certain field performance issues of its product are attributable to the quality of our supplied bearings 
we are confident that our bearings were made to the agreed upon design specifications and that the customer s field performance issues relate to factors outside of our control 
under the documents which comprise the sales contract  the customer is obligated to pay its liability and to reimburse us for inventory costs incurred and lost profits 
in order to expedite the resolution of this matter  we have agreed with the customer to enter into a mediation process  and if necessary  binding arbitration 
as we are confident in the quality of our supplied product and the customer s financial ability to pay  we have concluded that the receivables and inventory are fully realizable and the purchase commitments are fully recoverable 
capital expenditures to expand productive capacity  improve quality  and reduce costs equaled million in  million in  and million in the decrease in capital expenditures in compared to reflects the completion of our wind energy capital expansion in and our disciplined approach to managing capital expenditures during challenging economic conditions 
the increase in compared to reflects the capital spending on the wind energy growth initiative 
during   and  capital expenditures for the wind energy growth initiative totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
during we expect to invest approximately million in aggregate capital expenditures for all segments 
at december   we had a net position of million in an enhanced cash investment 
the fund issuer had restricted the redemption of the kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents fund to permit its orderly liquidation 
during  we received million in proceeds from the redemption of the remaining portion of this investment and recorded a million gain on the liquidation  which was recorded as interest income 
in we recorded million in losses as a reduction of interest income on the partial liquidation of the fund 
also in  we recorded charges as a reduction of interest income totaling million to reduce the gross investment to fair value 
we continue our corporate development efforts to complement internal growth through the acquisition of additional companies that meet our well disciplined criteria 
in october  we acquired avon bearings corporation for million  net of working capital adjustments recorded in an independent appraiser was engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of separately recognized intangible assets of avon 
after allocating cost to other assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  the excess cost of the acquisition  equal to million  was recognized as goodwill at december  in we recorded purchase price adjustments of million associated with this acquisition which increased the associated goodwill

our payments to various taxing authorities were million  million  and million during   and tax payments are expected to be approximately million during as part of governmental efforts to react to climate change and stimulate economic growth  the american reinvestment and recovery act of authorized the department of treasury to award tax credits for qualified investments in advanced energy projects  to support new  expand  or re equip domestic manufacturing facilities 
in we were awarded million in tax credits for our qualifying advanced energy investment which we expect to utilize beginning in in  we issued million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes were convertible into shares of company common stock provided certain contingencies were met 
during  holders of the notes converted their notes into company common stock  which were issued from treasury stock

we expect that our planned capital requirements  which consist of capital expenditures  dividend payments and our stock repurchase program  will be financed by operations and existing cash balances 
in addition  our revolving credit facility provides additional financial strength to support our objectives  including future acquisitions 
our significant contractual obligations as of december  are set forth below payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations for property  plant and equipment total we expect to make cash contributions of approximately million to our pension plans in we review our funding strategy for our pension plans on an ongoing basis 
we expect to contribute approximately million to our postretirement benefit plans in we have million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits which are excluded from the above table because the timing of settlement of these liabilities cannot be reasonably estimated 
corporate development our corporate development efforts are intended to complement internal growth through the acquisition of additional companies consistent with our well disciplined criteria 
we maintain a disciplined acquisition program  which has made important contributions to our growth 
in  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of avon bearings corporation avon in a cash transaction valued at million  net of million of working capital adjustments recorded in avon is a custom designer and manufacturer of high precision large diameter turntable bearings 
avon also remanufactures bearings and sells replacement bearings 
litigation we are a party to various pending lawsuits and other matters arising in the normal course of business 
our estimated legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with claims  lawsuits and environmental matters are accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
the costs accrued at december  and were not material 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  information from third party professionals  and various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from our current estimates 
we have identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products  and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to inventories to be critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change and cause projected outcomes to vary 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that is compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
we believe the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires our subjective judgments and the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  increasing the sensitivity of assumptions made  thus projected outcomes may vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on us  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note in this annual report for additional information regarding long lived assets 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which represents an operating segment or a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results 
currently eight of our reporting units have goodwill balances 
we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit is derived from an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow model for each reporting unit requires judgmental assumptions regarding each reporting unit s specific projected revenue growth  future operating margins  and working capital and capital expenditure requirements  in addition to assumptions of appropriate discount rates and terminal values based on growth rates in perpetuity 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these assumptions and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
while we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of our reporting units  it is possible a material change could occur 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in  as of our annual assessment date  we used a percent discount rate to calculate fair value for all of our reporting units 
in an percent discount rate was utilized 
the discount rate used each year is the value weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and estimated cost of debt cost of capital derived using both known and estimated  customary  marketplace metrics  including a size risk premium 
the one percent increase in the discount rate used for compared to is driven by the use of an additional market risk premium to account for the increased level of systematic risk prevailing in the market and the low yield for risk free securities as of the valuation date 
we currently utilize the same discount rate to estimate the fair value of all of our reporting units because we believe that the underlying similarities in the businesses within our portfolio result in a common risk profile with regard to assumed variability of estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
our calculation methodology was unchanged during  and the consistent application of this methodology may result in changes in the discount rate in future periods 
in arriving at future discounted cash flows for each reporting unit  we evaluate the appropriate kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents growth rate in perpetuity for each of our reporting units to calculate a terminal value of cash flows following each reporting unit s five year planning period 
the terminal value for each reporting unit is determined based on that unit s specific operating cash flow at the end of the planning period and the unit s assumed growth rate in perpetuity 
we currently utilize the same assumed growth rate in perpetuity of two percent in the discounted cash flow model of each of our reporting units 
this is based on our assumption that the long term growth rates following our planning periods no longer benefit from specifically planned reporting unit initiatives and therefore only reflect the overall approximate long term economic growth rate 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying amount is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  normally a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist us in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
our goodwill impairment testing in revealed that the excess of the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units tested over their carrying value expressed as a percentage of the carrying amount as of the july st annual testing date ranged from approximately percent to approximately percent 
assumptions regarding discount rate  revenue growth rates  operating profit margins and perpetuity growth rate may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test  we applied a hypothetical ten percent decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit 
the results of this ten percent hypothetical change in fair values would not have changed our conclusion that fair values exceeded carrying values in each case by a material amount 
certain trademarks are our only indefinite lived intangible assets 
we identify impairment of these trademarks by comparing their fair value to their carrying amounts 
the fair values of the trademarks are calculated based on estimates of discounted future cash flows related to the net amount of royalty expenses avoided due to the existence of the trademarks 
we believe the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of discounted future cash flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on us  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
retirement benefits our employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on our estimates provided to and used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we believe the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits in our financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth rates  and long term returns on plan assets 
we have developed estimates based on historical experience  information from third party professionals  and various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
in developing the discount rate assumption used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations  we use the weighted average of market observed yields for high quality fixed income securities with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits 
the equivalent weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook  and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
salary growth assumptions reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
for individual categories of equity securities  historical total and real rates of return are considered  together with inflation and overall market factors including dividend yield  earnings growth  changes in price to earnings ratios and volatility of returns 
for various fixed income asset categories  expected long term returns are determined after consideration of current yields on fixed income securities  inflation  historical yields relative to benchmarks  and long term default rates 
for other asset classes  including real estate  expected long term returns are determined through consideration of certain factors  which may include historical returns  dividend yields  inflation  benchmark returns and net asset values 
assumed discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  and rate of compensation increases have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plans 
the effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in each factor on the projected benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost would have been percentage point percentage point increase decrease discount rate effect on december  projected benefit obligation discount rate effect on the net periodic pension cost salary scale effect on december  projected benefit obligation salary scale effect on the net periodic pension cost expected return on plan assets effect on net periodic pension cost the following table summarizes certain of the company s assumptions postretirement pension benefits benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine projected benefit obligation discount rate qualified pension plans n a n a discount rate non qualified pension plan n a n a discount rate postretirement benefit plans n a n a rate of compensation increase age graded weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate qualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans discount rate non qualified pension plan n a n a expected long term return on plan assets n a n a rate of compensation increase age graded in  average in actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
the current market conditions for highly rated corporate bonds has a significant effect on our assumption for the discount rate used to determine projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost  where an increase decrease in interest rates will result in a decrease increase in the projected benefit obligation and decrease increase in net periodic benefit cost 
at december  the discount rates assumed were lower than those at december   affecting plan benefit obligations at december  and the net periodic pension cost for accordingly 
changes in current conditions in financial markets do not significantly alter the underlying long term expected return on plan assets each year 
however  actual returns compared to the expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the funded status of the plans  and consequently the net periodic pension cost and plan contributions in future periods 
the actual rate of return on plan assets in was significantly below the expected long term rate of return on plan assets reducing the funded status at december  and increasing the net periodic pension cost in we chose to make a voluntary contribution to our qualified pension plans in using cash generated from operations 
the actual rate of return on plan assets in significantly exceeded the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the combined effect kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents of our voluntary contribution and the actual rate of return on plan assets resulted in a relative improvement in the funding status of our qualified plans at december  and will result in reduced net periodic pension cost in our cash contributions required to fund our pension plans in are expected to be million 
the cash contributions and future expected contributions are expected to have only a minor impact on our current and future liquidity as we expect to meet funding requirements from cash generated in our operations or our available cash resources

income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed for recoverability by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
income tax is provided based upon an effective tax rate that is dependent upon tax regulations governing the regions in which we conduct business  geographic composition of worldwide earnings  the availability of tax credits and other factors 
we have liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits totaling million as of december   all of which would affect the effective tax rate 
it is our policy to include interest and penalties incurred due to underpayment or late payment of income taxes due to a taxing authority on a net of tax basis as a component of income tax expense 
we have recorded million in liabilities for tax related interest and penalties on our consolidated balance sheet  as of december  the company does not expect that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months 
the company  or one or more of its subsidiaries  operates and files income tax returns in the united states  various states  and foreign jurisdictions 
foreign jurisdictions significant to the company include germany and the united kingdom 
with limited exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal tax examinations for years before  state examinations for years before  german tax examinations for years before  or united kingdom tax examinations for years before we believe the accounting estimates related to income taxes to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities and to record current tax benefits and liabilities  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes to vary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
we place our investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on our pre tax earnings 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico  and asia 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies in these regions affect our financial condition and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which certain costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on our financial condition and cash flows
