item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital requirements revolving credit facility 
if the recapitalization and related transactions are consummated  and subject to market conditions at that time  the eagle rock management team intends to recommend to our board of directors an increase to the distribution per unit 
currently  we anticipate recommending a quarterly distribution at an annualized rate in the range of to per unit commencing no later than the distribution with respect to the fourth quarter of we expect this distribution level will allow us to retain a meaningful percentage of our available cash to fund potential organic growth projects and to further reduce our total leverage ratio defined in our revolving credit facility as the ratio of our debt to our adjusted ebitda to our targeted range of less than 
our estimated range for the distribution is subject to change should commodity prices  factors affecting the general business climate or our specific operations differ from our current expectations 
all actual distributions paid will be determined and declared at the discretion of our board of directors 
if the recapitalization and related transactions are not consummated  and absent other unforeseen events  the eagle rock management team does not anticipate recommending to our board of directors an increase to the distribution per unit until we have reached our targeted range for total leverage ratio through growth of our adjusted ebitda or repayment of debt 
we plan to institute a new distribution policy after we have reached our targeted range for our total leverage ratio 
this policy will include a baseline distribution that we believe would be sustainable in low commodity price environments 
the initial baseline distribution would be established by our board of directors and would be adjusted to reflect the long term impact of subsequent significant acquisitions and organic growth projects 
furthermore  under the policy  if we generate distributable cash flow in excess of that required to make the baseline distribution  we would distribute of the excess distributable cash flow above the amount required to cover the actual distribution by at least ie  a coverage ratio of at least 
we anticipate  at this point  the initial baseline distribution will be below the minimum quarterly distribution mqd of per unit specified in our current partnership agreement 
should the recapitalization and related transactions not be consummated and the subordinated units remain outstanding  payment of an initial baseline distribution below the mqd will result in arrearages on common units continuing to build 
in making the determination to establish the baseline distribution and future distribution coverage ratios  our board of directors will take into account our projected capital requirements  its view of future commodity prices  economic conditions present and forecasted in the united states and other economies around the world  and other variables that it believes could impact the near and long term sustainability of the baseline distribution 
in order to reduce the volatility in our distributions  our board of directors may decide to make the baseline distribution  even in quarters in which we do not generate sufficient distributable cash flow to fund such distributions  by using borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
under our new distribution policy  we plan to continue with our strategy of utilizing derivatives to mitigate the impact of changes in commodity prices on our financial results 
our board of directors will evaluate our distribution policy from time to time as conditions warrant in the future

table of contents item selected financial data 
the following table shows selected historical financial data of our predecessor  oneok texas field services lp  and of eagle rock pipeline  lp and eagle rock energy partners  lp oneok texas field services  lp is treated as our and eagle rock pipeline  lp s predecessor and is referred to as eagle rock predecessor because of the substantial size of the operations of oneok texas field services  lp as compared to eagle rock pipeline  lp and the fact that all of eagle rock pipeline  lp s operations at the time of the acquisition of oneok texas field services  lp related to an investment that was managed and operated by others 
references to eagle rock pipeline refer to eagle rock pipeline  lp  which is the acquirer of eagle rock predecessor and the entity contributed to us in connection with our initial public offering in october our historical results of operations for the periods presented below may not be comparable either from period to period or going forward  for the following reasons the purchase price paid in connection with the acquisition of eagle rock predecessor on december  was pushed down to the financial statements of eagle rock energy partners  lp as a result of this push down accounting  the book basis of our assets was increased to reflect the purchase price  which had the effect of increasing our depreciation expense 
in connection with our acquisition of the eagle rock predecessor  our interest expense subsequent to december  increased due to the increased debt incurred 
after our acquisition of eagle rock predecessor  we initiated a risk management program comprised of puts  costless collars and swaps for crude oil  natural gas and ngls  as well as interest rate swaps that we account for using mark to market accounting 
the amounts related to commodity hedges are included in unrealized realized gain loss derivatives gains losses and the amounts related to interest rate swaps are included in interest expenses income

the selected historical financial data as of and for the eleven month period ended november  are derived from the audited financial statements of eagle rock predecessor and as of and for the year ended december  are derived from the audited financial statements of eagle rock pipeline  lp the selected historical financial data as of and for the years ended december    and are derived from the audited financial statements of eagle rock energy partners  lp the following table includes the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss plus or minus income tax provision benefit  interest net  including realized interest rate risk management instruments and other expense  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  impairment expense  other operating expense  non recurring  other non cash operating and general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation related to our equity based compensation program  unrealized gains losses on commodity and interest rate risk management related instruments  gains losses on discontinued operations and other income expense 
we use adjusted ebitda as a measure of our core profitability to assess the financial performance of our assets 
adjusted ebitda is also used as a supplemental financial measure by external users of eagle rock s financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts 
for example  eagle rock s lenders under its revolving credit facility use a variant of eagle rock s adjusted ebitda in a compliance covenant designed to measure the viability of eagle rock and its ability to perform under the terms of its revolving credit facility  eagle rock  therefore  uses adjusted ebitda to measure its compliance with its revolving credit facility 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management team uses in evaluating performance 
adjusted ebitda is useful in determining our ability to sustain or increase distributions 
by excluding unrealized derivative gains losses  a non cash  mark to market benefit charge which represents the change in fair market value of our executed derivative instruments and is independent of our assets performance or cash flow generating ability  we believe adjusted ebitda reflects more accurately our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our level of indebtedness  make cash distributions to our unitholders and general partner and finance our maintenance capital expenditures 
we further believe that adjusted ebitda also describes more accurately the underlying performance of our operating assets by isolating the performance of our operating assets from the impact of an unrealized  non cash measure designed to describe the fluctuating inherent value of a financial asset 
similarly  by excluding the impact of non recurring discontinued operations  adjusted ebitda provides users of our financial statements a more accurate picture of our current assets cash generation ability  independently from that of assets which are no longer a part of our operations 
eagle rock s adjusted ebitda definition may not be comparable to adjusted ebitda or similarly titled measures of other entities  as other entities may not calculate adjusted ebitda in the same manner as eagle rock 
for example  we include in adjusted ebitda the actual settlement revenue created from our commodity hedges by virtue of transactions undertaken by us to reset commodity hedges to higher prices or purchase puts or other similar floors despite the fact that we exclude from adjusted ebitda any charge for amortization of the cost of such commodity hedge reset transactions or puts 
for a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  please read summary non gaap financial measures

see part ii item selection financial data non gaap financial measures for reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net cash flows from operating activities and net income loss 

table of contents non gaap financial measures we include in this filing the following non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda as defined on page 
we provide reconciliations of this non gaap financial measure to its most directly comparable financial measures as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
adjusted ebitda does not include interest expense  income taxes or depreciation and amortization expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate net income 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe that it is important to consider both net income determined under gaap  as well as adjusted ebitda  to evaluate our performance 
our adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and operating income and these measures may vary among companies 
therefore  our adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
for example  we include in adjusted ebitda the actual settlement revenue created from our commodity hedges by virtue of transactions undertaken by us to reset commodity hedges to higher prices or purchase puts or other similar floors despite the fact that we exclude from adjusted ebitda any charge for amortization of the cost of such commodity hedge reset transactions or puts
