item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two types of businesses funeral homes  which account for approximately of our revenues  and cemeteries  which account for approximately of our revenues 
funeral homes are principally a service business that provide funeral services traditional burial and cremation and sell related merchandise  such as caskets and urns 
cemeteries are primarily a sales business that sells interment rights grave sites and mausoleum spaces and related merchandise such as markers and outer burial containers 
as of december   we operated funeral homes in states and cemeteries in states within the united states 
substantially all administrative activities are conducted in our home office in houston  texas 
factors affecting our funeral operating results include demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age  which impact death rates and number of deaths  establishing and maintaining leading market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships  effectively responding to increasing cremation trends by selling complementary services and merchandise  controlling salary and merchandise costs  and exercising pricing leverage related to our at need business to increase average revenues per contract 
in simple terms  volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenues 
the average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately one third of the average revenue earned from a traditional burial service 
funeral homes have a relatively fixed cost structure 
thus  small changes in revenues  up or down  normally cause significant changes to our profitability 
the cemetery operating results are affected by the size and success of our sales organization 
approximately of our cemetery revenues relate to preneed sales of interment rights and related merchandise and services 
we believe that changes in the level of consumer confidence a measure of whether consumers will spend for discretionary items also affect the amount of cemetery revenues 
approximately of our cemetery revenues are attributable to investment earnings on trust funds and finance charges on installment contracts 
changes in the capital markets and interest rates affect this component of our cemetery revenues 
we have implemented long term initiatives in our operations designed to improve operating and financial results by growing market share and increasing profitability 
we introduced a more decentralized  entrepreneurial and local operating model in that included operating and financial standards developed from our best operations  along with an incentive compensation plan to reward business managers for successfully meeting or exceeding the standards 
the model essentially eliminated the use of line item financial budgets in favor of the standards 
the operating model and its standards  which we refer to as standards operating model  focus on the key drivers of a successful operation  organized around three primary areas market share  people and operating and financial metrics 
the model and standards are the measures by which we judge the success of each business 
to date  the standards operating model has driven significant changes in our organization  leadership and operating practices 
most importantly  the standards operating model allowed us to measure the sustainable revenue growth and earning power of our portfolio of deathcare businesses  which then led to development of a strategic acquisition model  noted below  during  that guides our acquisition and disposition strategies 
both models  when executed effectively  should drive longer term  sustainable increases in market share  revenue  earnings and cash flow 
the standards are not designed to produce maximum short term earnings because we do not believe such performance is sustainable without ultimately stressing the business  which often leads to declining market share  revenues and earnings 
important elements of the standards operating model include balanced operating model we believe a decentralized structure works best in the deathcare industry 
successful execution of the standards operating model is highly dependent on strong local leadership  intelligent risk taking  entrepreneurial drive and corporate support aligned with the key drivers 
incentives aligned with standards empowering managing partners to do the right things in their operations and local communities  and providing appropriate support with operating and financial practices  will enable long term growth and sustainable profitability 
each managing partner participates in a variable bonus plan whereby they earn a percentage of their business earnings based upon the actual standards achieved 
each managing partner has the opportunity to share in the earnings of the business as long as the performance exceeds our minimum standards 
the right local leadership successful execution of our operating model is highly dependent on strong local leadership as defined by our e leadership model  intelligent risk taking and entrepreneurial empowerment 
over time  a managing partner s performance is judged according to achievement of the standards for that business 
in  we executed the following near term initiatives to address the effects of the recession increase the number and quality of the sales staff at our larger cemeteries to counter the lower success rate that the economy is causing in regard to preneed cemetery sales and profits  convert direct cremations to cremations with services to increase the average revenue per cremation service in light of the larger then normal increase in the cremation mix  and manage costs and reduce expenses 

table of contents the impact of these initiatives is discussed below in our discussion of the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  acquisitions our growth strategy includes the execution of the strategic acquisition model 
the goal of that model is to build concentrated groups of businesses in ten to fifteen strategic markets 
we assess acquisition candidates using six strategic ranking criteria and to differentiate the price we are willing to pay 
those criteria are size of business  size of market  competitive standing  demographics  strength of brand  and barriers to entry 
in general terms  our price expectations range from four to five times pre tax earnings before depreciation for tuck ins to six to seven times pre tax earnings before depreciation for businesses that rank very high in the ranking criteria 
we derive the pre tax earnings amounts based primarily on the size and product mix of the target business applied to our standards based operating model 
during  we completed seven acquisitions and in  we completed two acquisitions 
the consideration paid in each of the acquisitions was cash 
we have not incurred any debt to buy these businesses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill  other intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  because there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be consistent from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral and cemetery merchandise and services when the merchandise is delivered or service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales accounting principles 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenues to be recognized and cash flow from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to preneed contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by us 
allowances for bad debts and customer cancellations are provided at the date that the sale is recognized as revenue and are based on our historical experience and the current economic environment 
we also monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions earned by the company are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is usually one year after the policy is issued 
preneed selling costs consist of sales commissions that we pay our sales counselors and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts and are expensed as incurred 

table of contents goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of funeral home businesses acquired in business combinations is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill has not historically been recorded in connection with the acquisition of cemetery businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment by assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units 
the funeral segment reporting units consist of our east  central and west regions in the united states and we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill using information as of august  in addition  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value 
factors that could trigger an interim impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant adverse changes in the business climate which may be indicated by a decline in the company s market capitalization or decline in operating results 
our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
in the first step of our goodwill testing  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both a market approach  weighted  and an income approach  weighted 
funeral home selling prices are typically quoted in the marketplace as a multiple of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our methodology for determining a market approach fair value utilized recent sales transactions in the industry 
our methodology for determining an income based fair value is based on discounting projected future cash flows 
the projected future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance that may differ from actual future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital for the company and other public deathcare companies 
goodwill impairment is not recorded where the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill and if the carrying amount exceeds the implied value  an impairment charge would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
a more complete discussion of the goodwill impairment testing is included below in item of this form k 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return and separate income tax returns in the states in which we operate 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  and account for uncertain tax positions in our financial statements 
the company records a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
management reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the company analyzes tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and how they are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  provides certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  and specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions are classified on the balance sheet 
we have reviewed our income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions  primarily related to business acquisitions  that are not certain 
our policy with respect to potential penalties and interest is to record them as other expense and interest expense  respectively 
the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would affect the company s effective tax rate 
the company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months 
stock plans and stock based compensation the company has stock based employee and director compensation plans in the form of restricted stock  performance units  stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based awards over the period of vesting 
fair value is determined on the date of the grant 
the fair value of options or awards containing options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
preneed funeral and cemetery trust funds the company s preneed and perpetual care trust funds are reported in accordance with principles of consolidating variable interest entities 
in the case of preneed trusts  the customers are the legal beneficiaries 
in the case of perpetual care trusts  the company does not have a right to access the corpus in the perpetual care trusts 
for these reasons  the company has recognized financial interests of third parties in the trust funds in our financial statements as deferred preneed funeral and cemetery receipts held in trust and care trusts corpus 
the investments of such trust funds are classified as available for sale and are reported at market value  therefore  the unrealized gains and losses  as well as accumulated and undistributed income and realized gains and losses are recorded to deferred preneed receipts held in trust and care trusts corpus in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company s future obligations to deliver merchandise and services are reported at estimated settlement amounts 
unrealized gains and losses attributable to the company  but that have not been earned through the performance of services or delivery of merchandise are allocated to deferred revenues 
effective january   a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as unconsolidated investment  is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated net income is reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the 
table of contents non controlling interest 
the net income  on the face of the consolidated income statement  is of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
we have determined that balances historically designated as non controlling interest in our consolidated preneed funeral and cemetery trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts do not meet this criteria for non controlling interest 
only a financial instrument classified as equity in the trusts financial statements can be a non controlling interest in the consolidated financial statements 
the interest related to our merchandise and service trusts is classified as a liability because the preneed contracts underlying these trusts are unconditionally redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is certain to occur 
since the earnings from our cemetery perpetual care trusts are used to support the maintenance of our cemeteries  we believe the interest in these trusts also retains the characteristics of a liability 
accordingly  effective december   the amounts historically described as non controlling interest in funeral and cemetery trusts are characterized as either deferred preneed funeral receipts held in trust or deferred preneed cemetery receipts held in trust  as appropriate 
the amounts historically described as non controlling interest in cemetery perpetual care trusts are characterized as care trusts corpus 
discontinued operations in accordance with the company s strategic acquisition model  non strategic businesses are reviewed to determine whether the business should be sold and the proceeds redeployed elsewhere 
a marketing plan is then developed for those locations which are identified as held for sale 
when the company receives a letter of intent and financing commitment from the buyer and the sale is expected to occur within one year  the location is no longer reported within the company s continuing operations 
the assets and liabilities associated with the location are reclassified as held for sale on the balance sheet and the operating results  as well as impairments  are presented on a comparative basis in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statements of operations  along with the income tax effect 
business combinations tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and goodwill is recognized for any difference between the price of the acquisition and fair value 
we customarily estimate related transaction costs known at closing 
to the extent that information not available to us at the closing date subsequently becomes available during the allocation period we may adjust goodwill  assets  or liabilities associated with the acquisition 
for the businesses acquired after january   we recognized the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at the fair values as of that date 
goodwill is measured as a residual of the fair values at acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred 
fair value measurements we define fair value as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities  the inputs utilized in calculating valuation measurements  and the effect of the measurement of significant unobservable inputs on earnings  or changes in net assets  as of the measurement date 
additional required disclosures are provided in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we have not elected to measure any additional financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
new guidance has been issued on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in an environment where the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
the new guidance reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
this guidance is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june   and it has had no affect on our financial position or results of operations 
new guidance also modifies the requirements for recognizing other than temporary impairment on debt securities and significantly changes the impairment model for such securities 
there is also modification of the presentation of other than temporary impairment losses and increases related disclosure requirements 
this change is effective for interim reporting periods ending after june   and it has had no affect on our financial position or results of operations 
computation of earnings per common share effective january   the accounting changed for unvested share based payment awards included in the calculation of earnings per share 
share based awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  whether paid or unpaid  are recognized as participating securities and included in the computation of both basic and diluted earnings per share 
our grants of restricted stock awards to our employees and directors are considered participating securities and we have prepared our current period earnings per share calculations and retrospectively revised our prior period calculations to include outstanding unvested restricted stock awards in the basic weighted average shares outstanding calculation 
for the three years ended december   
table of contents there was no material impact to basic and diluted earnings per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the required disclosure 
subsequent events management of the company evaluated events and transactions during the period beginning subsequent to december  through march   the date the financial statements were available to be issued  for potential recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements covered by this report 
there were no subsequent events to disclose 
recent accounting pronouncments and accounting changes variable interest entities new guidance amends the current practice of accounting for variable interest entities vie to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest s give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this new guidance is effective for us beginning january   for which we do not expect to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the income taxes for and goodwill impairment testing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of funeral home businesses acquired in business combinations is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill has not historically been recorded in connection with the acquisition of cemetery businesses 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment by assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units 
our funeral segment reporting units consist of our east  central and west regional divisions in the united states 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill using information as of august  our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
in the first step of our goodwill testing  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both a market approach  weighted  and an income approach  weighted 
funeral home selling prices are typically quoted in the marketplace as a multiple of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our methodology for determining a market approach fair value utilized recent sales transactions in the industry  calculated on the basis of ebitda multiples 
our methodology for determining an income based fair value is based on discounting projected future cash flows 
the projected future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance using a weighted average cost of capital for carriage and other public deathcare companies 
goodwill impairment is not recorded where the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill and if the carrying amount exceeds the implied value  an impairment charge would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
based on our impairment test performed using august  data  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
in addition to our annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value 
factors that could trigger an interim impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant adverse changes in the business climate which may be indicated by a decline in the company s market capitalization or decline in operating results 
the market capitalization of the company consists of the common stock  senior notes and convertible trust preferred securities 
no such events or changes occurred between the testing date and year end to trigger a subsequent impairment review 
liquidity and capital resources while the impact has not been dramatic yet  we believe the adverse economic conditions in the us will continue to affect our business and may impair our ability to access the capital markets  if needed 
carriage began with million in cash and other liquid investments and ended the year with million in cash and an undrawn million line of credit  except for letters of credit of million 
the elements of cash flow for consisted of the following in millions cash at beginning of year cash flow from operations acquisitions cash used for maintenance capital expenditures cash used for growth capital expenditures funeral homes cash used for growth capital expenditures cemeteries share repurchase program other investing and financing activities  net cash at end of year the outstanding principal of senior debt at december  totaled million and consisted of million in senior notes maturing in and million in acquisition indebtedness and capital lease obligations 
additionally  million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the credit facility at december  the company began with a million senior secured revolving credit facility that matured in april and is collateralized by all personal property and funeral home real property in certain states 
effective march   carriage amended its credit facility to  in part  lower its aggregate commitment amount under the facility to million in an effort to reduce 
table of contents commitment fees 
the company incurred a charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately  during the fiscal year to write off the remaining unamortized fees on the prior amendments to the credit facility 
the fees related to this amendment were approximately  subsequently  effective november   the company entered into another amendment to its bank credit facility 
the amended credit facility matures november  and contains commitments from the banks for an aggregate of million with an accordion provision for up to an additional million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company incurred a charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately  to write off the remaining unamortized fees on the prior amendments to the credit facility 
the fees related to the amendment were approximately  and will be amortized over the life of the amendment

if we are not able to meet these obligations with cash provided for by our operating activities  we may be required to access the capital markets or draw down on our credit facilities both of which may be more likely and more difficult to access due to the current economic crisis 
seasonality our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate 
generally  the rate is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year

risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are typically exposed to a variety of market risks 
currently  these are primarily related to changes in market values related to outstanding debts and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
we monitor current and forecasted interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business and seek to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
as of december   our outstanding debt is comprised entirely of fixed rate obligations 
we do not currently have any floating rate long term borrowings outstanding under our million floating rate line of credit 
if we borrow against the line of credit  any change in the floating rate would cause a change in interest expense 
the senior notes were issued to the public at par and are carried at a cost of million 
at december   these securities were typically trading at a price of approximately  indicating a market value of approximately million 

table of contents the convertible junior subordinated debentures  payable to carriage services capital trust  pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on our balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
the estimated fair value of these securities is estimated to be million at december  based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 
increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these debt instruments to decrease but such changes will not affect our interest costs 
the remainder of the our long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  nor otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease 
securities subject to market risk consist of investments held by our preneed funeral  cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care trust funds 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the estimated fair values of those securities 
the sensitivity of the fixed income securities is such that a change in interest rates causes an approximate change in the value of the fixed income securities
