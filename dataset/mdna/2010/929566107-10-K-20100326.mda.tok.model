item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a describes the matters that we consider to be important to understanding the results of our operations for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our capital resources and liquidity as of december  our discussion begins with our assessment of the condition of the north american trailer industry along with a summary of the actions we have taken to strengthen wabash 
we then analyze the results of our operations for the last three years  including the trends in the overall business and our operations segments  followed by a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity  capital markets events and transactions  our credit facility and contractual commitments 
we also provide a review of the critical accounting judgments and estimates that we have made that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
these are the critical accounting policies that affect the recognition and measurement of our transactions and the balances in our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recent accounting pronouncements that we adopted during the year  as well as those not yet adopted that are expected to have an impact on our financial accounting practices 
we have two reportable segments manufacturing and retail and distribution 
the manufacturing segment produces trailers that are sold to customers who purchase trailers directly or through independent dealers and to the retail and distribution segment 
the retail and distribution segment includes the sale of new and used trailers  as well as the sale of aftermarket parts and service through our retail branch network 
executive summary our results reflect the challenges that the trailer industry faced throughout the year as the factors negatively impacting demand for new trailers became more intense and pervasive across the united states 
as a result  the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging 
a weak housing market and overall weak consumer confidence were further magnified by credit tightening and severe shortages of liquidity in the financial markets 
the liquidity shortage has caused concern about the viability of many financial institutions and has negatively impacted the economy 
these factors combined together caused our revenue and gross profits to be significantly reduced from previous years 
gross profit declined during due to lower sales volumes and overhead costs which did not decline as rapidly as sales volumes  even though certain expenses such as materials and direct labor generally fluctuated with sales volumes 
as a result of these economic conditions  our financial position and liquidity were negatively impacted  including events of default which occurred under our revolving facility 
in addition  reflected in our annual report  our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph with respect to substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
in response to these various challenges  we pursued a wide range of strategic alternatives which resulted in the issuance of million of preferred stock and warrants by the company  which is discussed under the liquidity and capital resources section below 
in addition  we entered into an amended revolving facility which waived the previously incurred events of default 
despite these adverse conditions  we were able to achieve strong safety performance  improved process yield and productivity  as well as deliver significant improvements in operating results in the second half of the year reflecting the impact of our cost reduction initiatives 
as of december   our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity amounted to approximately million 
we believe our liquidity is adequate to meet our expected operating results  working capital needs and capital expenditures for we expect the overall trailer market for to be an improvement from in fact  recent estimates from industry forecasters  act and ftr associates ftr  indicate rising levels of shipments in each of the next three years 
act is currently estimating levels to be approximately  units  or an increase of while ftr anticipates a increase in new trailers for as compared to while we are encouraged to see signs of improvement in the overall trailer market for  we will proceed with caution as the overall demand levels are expected to be stronger in the second half of the year as compared to the first half 
in addition  based on the current low demand environment  pricing competition will continue to adversely impact our margins as manufacturers compete for limited opportunities in order to fill under utilized capacity 
we expect will remain a very price competitive environment  but we anticipate seeing pricing power improve as trailer order demand and confidence increases in the latter part of the year and into we are also not relying solely on volume recovery to improve operations and profitability 
we continue to try to optimize our cost structure to improve results  including the consolidation of our flatbed manufacturing facilities expected to be completed during the first half of operating performance we measure our operating performance in four key areas safety environmental  quality  productivity and cost reduction 
our objective of being better today than yesterday and better tomorrow than we are today is simple  straightforward and easily understood by all our associates 
safety environmental 
we made a improvement in our total recordable incident rate resulting in significant reductions in our workers compensation costs 
we maintain iso registration of our environmental management system 
we believe that our improved environmental  health and safety management translates into higher labor productivity and lower costs as a result of less time away from work and improved system management 
quality 
we monitor product quality on a continual basis through a number of means for both internal and external performance as follows internal performance 
our primary internal quality measurement is process yield 
process yield is a performance metric that measures the impact of all aspects of the business on our ability to ship trailers at the end of the production process 
in  quality expectations were increased while maintaining process yield performance and reducing rework 
external performance 
we actively measure and track our warranty claims and costs 
early life cycle warranty claims are trended for performance monitoring and have shown a steady improvement from an average of approximately claims per trailers in to claims per trailers in however  performance in deteriorated to claims per trailers produced as a result of supplied component issues and customer optioned materials used in place of our standard product offerings 
this information is utilized  along with other data  to drive continuous improvement initiatives relative to product quality and reliability 
through these efforts  we continue to realize improved quality  which has resulted in a sustained decrease for warranty payments over the past four years 
productivity 
we measure productivity on many fronts 
some key indicators include production line speed  man hours per trailer and inventory levels 
improvements over the last several years in these areas have translated into significant improvements in our ability to better manage inventory flow and control costs 
in  we focused on productivity enhancements within manufacturing assembly and sub assembly areas through developing the capability for mixed model production 
we also established a central warehousing and distribution center to improve material flow  inventory levels and inventory accuracy within our supply chain 
the final components of the warehousing consolidation project were completed in the end of the first quarter  thus realizing significant savings in the supply chain operation 
cost reduction 
we believe continuous improvement ci is a fundamental component of our operational excellence focus 
we deployed value engineering and analysis teams to improve product and process costs thus keeping us competitive in the marketplace 
in  we also took actions to reduce costs by temporarily slowing down production at some of our facilities  extending normal shutdown periods and reducing salaried headcount levels 
we deployed an operational excellence strategy to enhance a culture of daily continuous improvement 
we believe the improvements generated to date provide the flexibility needed to support our customers as well as provide the foundation for enhanced performance going forward 
industry trends truck transportation in the us  according to the ata  was estimated to be a billion industry in ata estimates that approximately of all freight tonnage is carried by trucks at some point during its shipment 
trailer demand is a direct function of the amount of freight to be transported 
to monitor the state of the industry  we evaluate a number of indicators related to trailer manufacturing and the transportation industry 
recent trends we have observed include the following transportation trailer cycle 
transportation  including trucking  is a cyclical industry that has experienced three cycles over the last years 
truck freight tonnage  according to ata statistics  started declining year over year in and has remained at depressed levels through in  the tonnage index dropped from  the largest annual decrease since  however  recent data shows improvement of freight tonnage in the fourth quarter of the trailer industry generally precedes transportation industry cycles 
the current cycle began in early when industry shipments totaled approximately  reached a peak in with shipments of approximately  and  based on current act estimates  reached the bottom in according to act  shipments in amounted to approximately  units and will grow to approximately  and  in and  respectively 
our view is generally consistent with that of act 
age of trailer fleets 
average age of fleets has increased during the recent industry downturn 
according to act  average age of dry and refrigerated vans has continued to increase and is expected to reach historical highs by of approximately years and years  respectively 
these increases would suggest an increase in replacement demand over the next five years 
new trailer orders 
according to act  quarterly industry order placement rates have experienced year over year declines since the fourth quarter of  with the exception of the second and fourth quarters of total trailer orders in were approximately  units  a decrease from approximately  units ordered in driven by dry van orders  the largest segment of the trailer industry  declining year over year by approximately 
other developments 
other developments and our view of their potential impact on the industry include increased adoption of trailer tracking technology has improved fleet productivity  resulting in improved trailer utilization and declining trailer tractor ratios 
miniaturization of electronic products resulting in increased density of loads could further decrease demand for dry van trailers 
packaging optimization of bulk goods and the efficiency of the packaging around goods may contribute to further decreases in demand for dry van trailers 
continuing improvements in trailer quality and durability resulting from technological advances like duraplate composite  as well as increased trailer utilization due to growing adoption of trailer tracking could result in reduced trailer demand 
trucking company profitability  which can be influenced by factors such as fuel prices  freight tonnage volumes  and government regulations  is highly correlated with the overall economy of the us decreases in trucker profitability reduce the demand for  and financial ability to purchase  new trailers 
although truck driver shortages have not been a large problem in the past year  the constraint is expected to return as freight demand increases 
as a result  trucking companies are under increased pressure to look for alternative ways to move freight  leading to more intermodal freight movement 
we believe that railroads are at or near capacity  which will limit their ability to grow 
we therefore expect that the majority of freight will still be moved by truck

impairment of goodwill we reviewed our goodwill during the fourth quarter of and  based on a combination of factors  including the significant decline in our market capitalization as well as the current decline in the us economy  we concluded that indicators of potential impairment were present 
the measurement of impairment of goodwill consists of a two step process 
the first step requires us to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
during the fourth quarter  we completed a valuation of the fair value of our reporting units that incorporated existing market based considerations as well as discounted cash flows based on current and projected results 
based on this evaluation  it was determined that the carrying value of both our platform trailer and wood product manufacturing operations exceeded fair value 
the second step involves determining an implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill as compared to its carrying value 
after calculating the implied fair value of the goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit  it was determined that the recorded goodwill of million was fully impaired 
based on these facts and circumstances  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment of million 
other income expense gain on debt extinguishment in of million represents the gain recognized on the extinguishment of million of our senior convertible notes  which were purchased at a discount to par value  net of related deferred debt issuance costs 
income taxes in  we recognized income tax expense of million compared to million in the effective rate for was 
this rate differs from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to the recognition of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset and the write off of non deductible goodwill 
as of december   we had million of remaining us federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards  which will expire in if unused  and which may be subject to other limitations on use under irs rules 
liquidity and capital resources capital structure the year ending december was a challenging year for the trailer industry as the factors negatively impacting demand for new trailers became more intense and pervasive across the united states 
as a result  the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging  and our revenue and gross profits were significantly reduced from previous years 
as a result of these economic conditions  our financial position and liquidity were negatively impacted  including events of default which occurred under our previous revolving credit facility 
in light of the economic conditions  the decline in our operating results and the instability in the capital markets  on july   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with trailer investments pursuant to which trailer investments purchased  shares of series e preferred   shares of series f preferred  and  shares of series g preferred for an aggregate purchase price of million 
trailer investments also received a warrant that is exercisable at per share for  newly issued shares of our common stock representing  on august   the date the warrant was delivered  of our issued and outstanding common stock after giving effect to the issuance of the shares underlying the warrant  subject to upward adjustment to maintain that percentage if currently outstanding options are exercised 
the number of shares of common stock subject to the warrant is also subject to upward adjustment to an amount equivalent to of the issued and outstanding common stock outstanding immediately after the closing after giving effect to the issuance of the shares underlying the warrant in specified circumstances where we lose the ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  including as a result of a stockholder acquiring greater than of our outstanding common stock 
of the aggregate amount of million received  approximately million was attributed to the warrant and million was attributed to the preferred stock based on the estimated fair values of these instruments as of the date of issuance 
the difference between the initial value and the liquidation value of the preferred stock  including issuance costs of approximately million  will be accreted as preferred stock dividends over a period of five years using the effective interest method 
the series e preferred  series f preferred and series g preferred pay an annual dividend rate of  and  respectively 
the dividend on each series of preferred stock is payable quarterly and subject to increase by every quarter if the applicable series of preferred stock is still outstanding after august  during the first two years following the issuance of the preferred stock  we may elect to accrue these dividends unpaid in which these unpaid dividends accrue dividends 
accordingly  the unpaid accrued dividends as of december  have been reflected in preferred stock on our consolidated balance sheet 
the unpaid dividends  including the additional dividends accrued as a result of previously unpaid dividends  are not required to be repaid until redemption of the preferred stock  but is not precluded from being paid prior to redemption without penalty  at our discretion 
additionally  the preferred stock restricts our ability to declare or pay cash dividends to the holders of common stock so long as any shares of the preferred stock remain outstanding unless otherwise approved by the majority of the holders of the outstanding preferred stock 
the preferred stock also provides the holders with certain rights including an increase in the dividend rate upon the occurrence of any event of noncompliance 
we may at any time after one year from the date of issuance redeem all or any portion of the preferred stock with a liquidation value of  per share including a premium adjustment ranging between and if redemption occurs before august  the premium for early redemption would be applied to the sum of the liquidation value and any accrued and unpaid dividends  except as previously discussed 
upon occurrence of a change of control of the company  including if more than of the voting power is transferred or acquired by any person other than trailer investments and its affiliates unless trailer investments or its affiliates acquire the company  the preferred stock becomes immediately redeemable at the election of the holder at the liquidation value plus a premium of of the sum of the liquidation price plus all accrued and unpaid dividends for series e preferred and series f preferred and at the liquidation value plus a premium of for series g preferred 
the change of control provisions for the preferred stock are subject to a look back provision  whereby if the shares of preferred stock are redeemed pursuant to the voluntary redemption provisions within months prior to the occurrence of a change of control  we would still have to pay the additional amount to the holders of the preferred stock that was redeemed so that such holders would receive the aggregate payments equal to the change of control redemption amounts 
the warrant contains several conditions  including  among other things  an upward adjustment of shares upon the occurrence of certain contingent events and an option by the holder to settle the warrant for cash in event of a specific default 
these provisions result in the classification of the warrant as a liability that is adjusted to fair value at each balance sheet date 
if the option to settle the warrant for cash is required  it would have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
the warrant liability was recorded initially at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value reflected in earnings 
estimating fair values of the warrants requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may  and are likely to  change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors 
in addition  option based techniques are highly volatile and sensitive to changes in the trading market price of our common stock  which has a high historical volatility 
since derivative financial instruments are initially and subsequently carried at fair value  our statements of operations will reflect the volatility in these estimate and assumption changes 
the fair value of the warrant was estimated using a binomial valuation model 
in accordance with the securities purchase agreement  trailer investments has the right to nominate five out of twelve members of our board of directors 
furthermore  trailer investments also has the following rights rights to information delivery and access to information and our management team  veto rights over certain significant aspects of our operations and business  including payments of dividends  issuance of our securities  incurrence of indebtedness  liquidation and sale of assets  changes in the size of our board of directors  amendments of organizational documents of the company and its subsidiaries and other material actions by the company  subject to certain thresholds and limitations  right of first refusal to participate in any future private financings  and certain other customary rights granted to investors in similar transactions 
we were also required to promptly file a registration statement to permit resale of the warrant shares to the maximum extent possible  and that registration statement became effective on december  as of december   our debt to equity ratio was approximately our long term objective is to generate operating cash flows sufficient to fund normal working capital requirements  to fund capital expenditures and to be positioned to take advantage of market opportunities 
for we expect to fund operating results  working capital requirements and capital expenditures through cash flows from operations as well as available borrowings under our revolving facility 
debt agreements concurrent with entering into the securities purchase agreement  on july   we entered into a third amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended facility with our lenders  effective august   with a maturity date of august  the amended facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of ours and secured by substantially all of our assets 
the amended facility has a capacity of million  subject to a borrowing base  a million reserve and other discretionary reserves 
the amended facility amends and restates our previous revolving credit facility  and our lenders waived certain events of default that had occurred under the previous revolving credit facility and waived the right to receive default interest during the time the events of default had continued 
the interest rate on borrowings under the amended facility from the date of effectiveness  or august   through july  is libor plus or the prime rate of bank of america  na the prime rate plus 
after july   the interest rate is based upon average unused availability and will range between libor plus to or the prime rate plus to 
we are required to pay a monthly unused line fee equal to times the average daily unused availability along with other customary fees and expenses of our agent and lenders 
all interest and fees are paid monthly 
the amended facility contains customary representations  warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  including  without limitation  restrictions on mergers  dissolutions  acquisitions  indebtedness  affiliate transactions  the occurrence of liens  payments of subordinated indebtedness  disposition of assets  leases and changes to organizational documents 
under the amended facility  we may not repurchase or redeem our common stock and may not pay cash dividends to our common stockholders until the second anniversary of the effectiveness of the amended facility  or august   and then only if i no default or events of default are then in existence or would be caused by such purchase  redemption or payment  ii immediately after such purchase  redemption or payment  we have unused availability of at least million  iii the amount of all cash dividends paid does not exceed million in any fiscal year and iv at least business days prior to the purchase  redemption or payment  any one of our officers has delivered a certificate to our lenders certifying that the conditions precedent in clauses i iii have been satisfied 
we are  however  permitted to repurchase stock from employees upon termination of their employment so long as no default or event of default exists at the time or would be caused by such repurchase and such repurchases do not exceed million in any fiscal year 
in addition  we may not repurchase or redeem the preferred stock and may not pay cash dividends to the holders of the preferred stock until july  at any time after july  until the second anniversary of the effectiveness of the amended facility  we may pay cash dividends or redeem or repurchase the preferred stock if i no default or events of default are then in existence or would be caused by such purchase  redemption or payment  ii immediately after such purchase  redemption or payment  we have unused availability of at least million and iii at least business days prior to the purchase  redemption or payment  any one of our officers has delivered a certificate to our lenders certifying that the conditions precedent in clauses i iii have been satisfied 
after the second anniversary of the effectiveness of the amended facility  the unused availability condition precedent is reduced to million 
the amended facility contains customary events of default including  without limitation  failure to pay obligations when due under the amended facility  false and misleading representations  breaches of covenants subject in some instances to cure and grace periods  defaults on certain other indebtedness  the occurrence of certain uninsured losses  business disruptions for a period of time that materially adversely affects the capacity to continue business on a profitable basis  changes of control and the incurrence of certain judgments that are not stayed  released or discharged within days 
cash flow cash used in operating activities amounted to million in as compared to of cash provided by operations in the use of cash from operating activities in was primarily the result of million of net losses  adjusted for various non cash activities  including depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and changes in the fair value of our warrant  offset by improvements in our working capital 
changes in working capital accounted for a source of cash totaling million in and million in the reduced sales volumes and purchasing activities due to the slow economy and our focus on working capital and liquidity management have yielded positive cash flow results 
changes to key working capital accounts for compared to the prior year are summarized below in millions change accounts receivable inventories accounts payable and accrued liabilities during  accounts receivable decreased by million as compared to a decrease of million in the decrease for was primarily the result of the reduction in sales volumes as reported within our consolidated statements of operations 
days sales outstanding  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a receivable is outstanding  grew to approximately days in compared to days in inventory decreased million during compared to a decrease of million in the inventory decrease for was due to lower new and used trailer inventories resulting from continued weak market demand as well as improvements in our inventory management system 
inventory turns  a commonly used measure of working capital efficiency that measures how quickly inventory turns per year  was approximately five times in and seven times in accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased million in compared to a decrease of million in the decrease in the current year was primarily due to lower raw material and component part purchases as compared to the prior year due to lower production levels and the slow demand 
days payable outstanding  a measure of working capital efficiency that measures the amount of time a payable is outstanding  was days for compared to days for investing activities used million in compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease of million from the prior year was due to limiting capital spending to required replacement projects and cost reduction initiatives 
the period includes million used to acquire certain equipment from benson international llc  a manufacturer of aluminum flatbeds  dump trailers and other truck bodies 
financing activities used million in as the proceeds received from the issuance of preferred stock and a warrant to trailer investments were more than offset by debt payments made on outstanding borrowings under the amended facility 
dividend payments were suspended as of december as of december   our liquidity position  defined as cash on hand and available borrowing capacity  net of availability reserves as established in our amended facility  amounted to approximately million and total debt and capital lease obligations amounted to approximately million 
as a result of the august  investment and concurrent with our amended facility  described in the capital structure section above  we believe our liquidity is adequate to meet our expected operating results  working capital needs and capital expenditures for  a period of economic uncertainty 
in light of current uncertain market and economic conditions  we have and will continue to aggressively manage our cost structure  capital expenditures and cash position 
we implemented various cost reduction actions in that have substantially decreased our overhead and operating costs  including salaried workforce headcount reductions of approximately associates  or  bringing total salaried headcount reductions to over  or approximately associates  since the beginning of the industry downturn in early  a temporary reduction in base salary for executive officers  a temporary reduction of of annualized base salary for all remaining exempt level salaried associates  combined with a reduction in the standard work week for most from hours to hours  a temporary reduction in the standard paid work week from hours to hours for all non exempt associates  a temporary reduction in hourly wages  a temporary reduction of director cash compensation  a temporary suspension of the k company match  the introduction of a voluntary unpaid layoff program with continuation of benefits  the continued close regulation of the work day and headcount of hourly associates  and the consolidation of our transcraft production facilities to be completed in early these actions are incremental to previous actions taken during this downturn  including idling of plants and assembly lines  consolidation and transformation initiatives at our lafayette facility  salaried workforce reductions  reductions in total compensation awards to executives and other eligible participants  the suspension of any company match for non qualified plan participants and the suspension of our quarterly dividend 
capital expenditures capital spending for amounted to million and is anticipated to be approximately million for the spending for will be limited to the consolidation of our transcraft production facilities  required replacement projects and cost reduction initiatives in efforts to manage cash flows and enhance liquidity 
off balance sheet transactions as of december   we had approximately million in operating lease commitments 
we did not enter into any material off balance sheet debt or operating lease transactions during the year 
outlook we continue to face uncertainty regarding the demand for trailers during the current economic environment 
according to the most recent act estimates  total trailer industry shipments for are expected to be up from to approximately  units 
by product type  act is estimating that van trailer shipments will be up approximately in compared to act is forecasting that platform trailer shipments will grow approximately and dump trailer shipments will increase approximately in for  act estimates that shipments will grow approximately to a total of  units 
downside concerns for relate to continued issues with the global economy  unemployment  tight credit markets  as well as depressed housing and construction related markets in the us taking into consideration recent economic and industry forecasts  as well as discussions with customers and suppliers  management expects demand for new trailers to improve as we move through and the economy continues to improve 
even so  the trailer industry will continue to be challenged and  although our financial condition is expected to improve with increased volume  we expect to incur net losses in  which will further reduce our stockholders equity 
we believe we are well positioned for long term growth in the industry because our core customers are among the dominant participants in the trucking industry  our duraplate trailer continues to have increased market acceptance  our focus is on developing solutions that reduce our customers trailer maintenance costs  and we expect some expansion of our presence into the mid market carriers 
while our expectations for industry volumes are generally in line with those of act  pricing will continue to be difficult in due to overcapacity and fierce competitive activity 
in addition raw material and component costs are expected to rise as overall demand will drive an increase in prices as the economy improves 
as has been our policy  we will endeavor to pass along raw material and component price increases to our customers 
we have a focus on continuing to develop innovative new products that both add value to our customers operations and allow us to continue to differentiate our products from the competition in order to return to profitability

significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates balance sheet caption critical estimate item nature of estimates required assumptions approaches used key factors other accrued liabilities and other non current liabilities warranty estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold and payment amounts  combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims  recall campaigns and discussions with our customers 
failure rates and estimated repair costs accounts receivable  net allowance for doubtful accounts estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate the financial capability of customers to pay for products 
we base our estimates on historical experience  the time an account is outstanding  customer s financial condition and information from credit rating services 
customer financial condition inventories lower of cost or market write downs we evaluate future demand for products  market conditions and incentive programs 
estimates are based on recent sales data  historical experience  external market analysis and third party appraisal services 
market conditions product type property  plant and equipment  goodwill  intangible assets  and other assets valuation of long lived assets and investments we are required periodically to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  and independent trailer production volume estimates 
future production estimates discount rate deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carry forwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings 
we use projected future operating results  based upon our business plans  including a review of the eligible carry forward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
variances in future projected profitability  including by taxing entity tax law changes additional paid in capital stock based compensation we are required to estimate the fair value of all stock awards we grant 
we use a binomial valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock awards 
we feel the binomial model provides the most accurate estimate of fair value 
risk free interest rate historical volatility dividend yield expected term in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the determination of the fair market value of new and used trailers is subject to variation  particularly in times of rapidly changing market conditions 
a change in the valuation of our new and used inventories would be approximately million 
other inflation we have historically been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have  a significant impact on our business 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued a statement on accounting standards codification 
the statement establishes the codification as the single official source of authoritative united states accounting and reporting standards for all non governmental entities other than guidance issued by the sec

in addition  we shall disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated and whether that date is the date the financial statements were issued or the date the financial statements were available to be issued 
the requirements of the statement were effective for interim and annual financial periods ending after june  we evaluated our december  consolidated financial statements for subsequent events through the date that our consolidated financial statements were filed with the sec 
no subsequent events have taken place that meet the definition of a subsequent event that requires further disclosure in this filing

this statement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   and we adopted in the first quarter of as the statement only requires enhanced disclosures  it has not had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in september  the fasb issued a statement on fair value measurements 
the statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and only applies when other standards require or permit the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities 
it does not expand the use of fair value measurement 
in february  the fasb announced that it was deferring the effective date to fiscal years beginning after november  for certain non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
for these financial and non financial assets and liabilities that are remeasured at least annually  this statement was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  derivative instruments and hedging activities are carried at fair value 
the adoption of this statement has not had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements 
in june  the fasb issued a statement on determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
the statement identifies that unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and shall be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
all prior period earnings per share data presented shall be adjusted retrospectively to conform to the provisions of this statement 
while our computations of earnings per share have been retrospectively restated  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or earnings per share for any period presented 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in our operations  we have exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding our exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks we are exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and polyethylene 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
historically  we have managed aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with our suppliers 
as of december   we had million in raw material purchase commitments through december for materials that will be used in the production process 
we typically do not set prices for our products more than days in advance of our commodity purchases and can  subject to competitive market conditions  take into account the cost of the commodity in setting our prices for each order 
to the extent that we are unable to offset the increased commodity costs in our product prices  our results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   we had million of floating rate debt outstanding under our revolving facility 
a hypothetical basis point change in the floating interest rate from the current level would result in a corresponding million change in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes
