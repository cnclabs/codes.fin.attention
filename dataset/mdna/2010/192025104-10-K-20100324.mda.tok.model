critical accounting estimates disclosure of codorus valley s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report 
some of these policies require management to make significant judgments  estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management makes significant estimates in determining the allowance for loan losses  valuation of foreclosed real estate  and evaluation of other than temporary impairment losses of securities 
management considers a variety of factors in establishing allowance for loan losses such as current 
table of contents economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  financial and managerial strength of borrowers  adequacy of collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
foreclosed real estate is initially recorded at fair value minus estimated costs to sell at the date of foreclosure  establishing a new cost basis 
appraisals are generally used to determine fair value 
after foreclosure  management reviews valuations at least quarterly and adjusts the asset to the lower of cost or fair value minus estimated costs to sell 
estimates related to the value of collateral can have a significant impact on whether or not management continues to accrue income on delinquent loans and on the amounts at which foreclosed real estate is recorded on the statement of financial condition 
the corporation records its available for sale securities portfolio at fair value 
fair values for these securities are determined based on methodologies in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification asc topic prior authoritative literature sfas no 
 fair value measurement and disclosures  and as clarified by several fasb staff positions 
fair values for debt securities are volatile and may be influenced by any number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates  credit ratings and yield curves 
fair values for debt securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments or an estimate of fair value by using a range of fair value estimates in the market place as a result of the illiquid market specific to the type of security 
when the fair value of a debt security is below its amortized cost and depending on the length of time the condition exists and the extent the fair value is below amortized cost  additional analysis is performed to determine whether an other than temporary impairment condition exits 
available for sale and held to maturity debt securities are analyzed quarterly for possible other than temporary impairment 
the analysis considers whether the corporation has the intent to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity and whether it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell its debt securities prior to market recovery or maturity 
often  information available to conduct these assessments is limited and rapidly changing  making estimates of fair value subject to judgment 
if actual information or conditions are different than estimated  the extent of the impairment of the debt security may be different than previously estimated  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
management discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and related management discussion and analysis disclosure with the audit committee 
there were no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented within this report 
additional information is contained in management s discussion and analysis regarding critical accounting estimates  including the provision and allowance for loan losses  located on pages and of this report

table of contents risk management the corporation s risk management committee committee meets at least quarterly and includes members of senior management and an independent director 
the objective of the committee is to identify and manage risk inherent in the operations of the corporation and its affiliates 
while the committee s risk review is broad in scope  its primary responsibility is to develop  implement and monitor compliance with formal risk management policies and procedures 
credit risk management credit risk represents the possibility that a loan client  counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms  posing one of the most significant risks of loss to the corporation 
accordingly  the corporation emphasizes the management of credit risk 
to support this objective a sound lending policy framework has been established 
this framework includes seven basic policies that guide the lending process and minimize risk 
first  the corporation follows detailed written lending policies and procedures 
second  lending authority is granted commensurate with dollar amount  loan type  level of risk  and loan officer experience 
third  loan review committees function at both the senior lending officer level and the board level to review and approve loans that exceed pre established dollar thresholds and or meet other criteria 
fourth  the corporation lends mainly within its primary geographical market area  york county  pennsylvania and northern maryland 
although this focus may pose a geographical concentration risk  the diverse local economy and employee knowledge of customers lessens this risk 
fifth  the loan portfolio is diversified to prevent dependency upon a single customer or small group of related customers 
sixth  the corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market  nor does it invest in securities backed by subprime mortgages 
and seventh  the corporation does not lend to foreign countries or persons residing therein 
the corporation uses loan to value ratios ltv ratios to minimize the risk of loss from the loan portfolio 
at december   the ltv ratios listed below were in effect 
loan type ltv ratio residential  owner occupied units  tax assessment residential  owner occupied units  certified appraisal residential  non owner occupied units  certified appraisal residential  or more units agricultural commercial industrial vacant land an acceptable valuation is required on all real estate secured loans 
generally  an appraisal performed by an independent licensed appraiser is required for real estate secured loans where the amount is above  or is non owner occupied  or if the ltv ratio is above percent for commercial property or above percent of the tax assessed value for owner occupied residential property 
exceptions to ltv ratios and the use of a licensed appraiser are sometimes made by management when there are compensating factors 
one component of the internal credit risk review is the identification and management of industry concentrations  defined as greater than percent of the total loan portfolio 
at year end and  the corporation had two industry concentrations that exceeded percent of the total loan portfolio real estate construction and land development was and percent of the portfolio  respectively  and commercial real estate leasing was and percent of the portfolio  respectively 
loans to borrowers within these industries are usually collateralized by real estate 

table of contents in addition to a comprehensive lending policy  numerous internal reviews of loan and foreclosed real estate portfolios occur throughout the year 
in addition to management s reviews in connection with its internal controls  loan portfolios are reviewed by independent auditors in connection with their annual financial statement audit and are examined periodically by bank regulators 
nonperforming assets the following table presents a five year history of asset categories posing the greatest risk of loss and related ratios 
management generally places a loan on nonaccrual status and ceases accruing interest income when loan payment performance is unsatisfactory and the loan is past due days or more 
loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  are contractually past due  but well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the final category  foreclosed real estate  is real estate acquired to satisfy debts owed to peoplesbank 
the paragraphs below explain significant changes in the aforementioned categories for december   compared to december nonperforming assets are reviewed by management each month 
management generally relies on appraisals performed by independent licensed appraisers to determine the value of impaired  collateral dependent loans 
in instances where the value of the collateral minus estimated selling costs is less than the net carrying amount of the loan  a loss allowance is established for that difference by recording a loss provision to the income statement 
when it is probable that some portion or all of the loan balance will not be collected that amount is charged off as loss against the allowance 
a loan is returned to accrual status when management determines that circumstances have improved to the extent that all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured

the nonaccrual loan portfolio balance totaled  on december   an increase of  or percent above year end the increase was primarily the result of prolonged weak economic conditions and the corresponding effects it on our commercial borrowers 
on december   the nonaccrual loans portfolio was comprised of twenty three unrelated accounts 
table of contents ranging in size from  to  six unrelated commercial loan accounts  which represent percent of the total nonaccrual loan portfolio balance  are described below 
management has established a loss allowance for selected accounts where the net realizable value of the collateral is insufficient to repay the loan 
management and the board of directors evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at least quarterly 
collection efforts  including modification of contractual terms for individual accounts based on prevailing market conditions and liquidation of collateral assets  are being employed to maximize recovery 
further provisions for loan losses may be required on nonaccrual loans when additional information becomes available 
loan no 
the outstanding principal loan balance is  based on an appraisal of the improved real estate  an  square foot office building  collateralizing the loan and other factors  management established a  allowance for possible loss

loan no 
the outstanding principal loan balance is  this account is collateralized by three acres of improved real estate located in a major commercial district and a small parcel of improved real estate and the assignment of a personal loan from a third party whose payments are current

of this total  lots are improved 
management established a  reserve for probable loss for this collateral dependent loan  which was based on a recent appraisal from an independent appraiser 
for  the gross interest income that would have been recorded if the nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and current throughout the period was approximately  the amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in net income for was approximately  the interest income recognized on impaired loans  which 
table of contents includes nonaccrual loans  in note impaired  nonaccrual and past due loans is a lesser amount because it includes interest income only from the time the loan was impaired 
the foreclosed real estate portfolio balance  net of allowance  totaled  on december  it was comprised of seven unrelated accounts ranging in size from  to  which management is actively attempting to liquidate 
foreclosed real estate is included in the other assets category on the corporation s balance sheet 
five unrelated accounts  which represent percent of the total foreclosed real estate portfolio balance  are described below 
if a valuation allowance for possible loss was established for a particular property it is so noted in the property description 
property no 
the property is a five story  mid rise apartment complex comprised of residential condominium units 
its carrying value is  subsequent to year end  a sales contract was executed for the entire complex with settlement planned in the first quarter of it is anticipated that the sales price less selling costs will result in full recovery of the carrying value

the carrying value of peoplesbank s interest is  which is net of an  allowance for possible loss 
subsequent to year end  the lead bank executed a sales contract and is presently awaiting settlement  which is expected to have an immaterial impact on earnings 
on december   there were approximately million in potential problem loans closely monitored by management 
potential problem loans consist of loans for which management has doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present repayment terms  and which are not disclosed in table a loss allowance is established for those potential problem loans that  in management s judgment  were inadequately collateralized 
comparatively  management was monitoring approximately million in potential problem loans on december  allowance for loan losses although the corporation maintains sound credit policies  certain loans deteriorate and must be charged off as losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses inherent in the portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and is reduced by loan charge offs  net of recoveries 
the allowance is based upon management s continuous evaluation of the loan portfolio coupled with a formal review of adequacy on a quarterly basis  which is subject to review and approval by the board 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses consists primarily of two components  specific allowances for individually impaired commercial loans and allowances calculated for pools of loans 
the corporation uses an internal risk rating system to evaluate individual loans 
loans are segmented into industry groups or pools with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on quantitative factors such as recent loss history  and qualitative factors  such as the results of internal and external credit reviews  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  adequacy of collateral  general economic conditions and the local business outlook 
determining the level of the allowance for probable loan losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
management must make estimates using assumptions and information which are often subjective and fluid 
table analysis of allowance for loan losses presents an analysis of the activity in the allowance for loan losses over a five year period 
table allocation of allowance for loan losses presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses by major loan category 
during  the analysis of adequacy of the allowance was refined to better measure risks associated with quantitative and qualitative risk factors applied to pooled industry segments 
as a result  the unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses decreased for december   compared to prior years 
generally  the unallocated component for year end reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the loan portfolio 
the allowance was  or percent of total loans  on december   compared to  and percent  respectively  on december  the increase in the allowance reflects credit quality issues for selected commercial real estate loans and was based on management s estimate of the amount necessary to bring the allowance to a level reflective of the risk in the loan portfolio and loan growth 
management considered macro economic factors that could adversely affect the ability of peoplesbank s loan clients to repay their loans  including the high level of unemployment and the probable continuation of a downturn in the commercial real estate market 
the corporation does not participate in the subprime lending market and accordingly  it has no direct loss exposure to subprime lending 
based on its evaluation of probable loan losses in the current portfolio  management believes that the allowance is adequate to support losses inherent in the loan portfolio on december  the large recovery in of prior period commercial loan losses was discussed in the provision for loan loss section of this report

furthermore  the portion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount available for future losses that might occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
liquidity maintaining adequate liquidity provides the corporation with the ability to meet financial obligations to depositors  loan customers  employees  and shareholders on a timely and cost effective basis in the normal course of business 
additionally  it provides funds for growth and business opportunities as they arise 
liquidity is generated from transactions relating to both the corporation s assets and liabilities 
the primary sources of asset liquidity are scheduled investment security maturities and cash inflows  funds received from customer loan payments  and asset sales 
the primary sources of liability liquidity are deposit growth  short term borrowings and long term debt 
the consolidated statements of cash flows  included in this report  present the changes in cash from operating  investing and financing activities 
for  management believes that liquidity was adequate based on the potential liquidation of a million portfolio of available for sale securities  valued at december   and available credit from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
on december   available net funding from the fhlbp was approximately million 
the corporation s loan to deposit ratio was percent for year end  compared to percent for year end the decrease in the ratio was the result of deposit growth outpacing loan growth in off balance sheet arrangements the corporation s financial statements do not reflect various commitments that are made in the normal course of business  which may involve some liquidity risk 
these commitments consist primarily of commitments to grant new loans  unfunded commitments under existing loan facilities  and letters of credit issued under the same standards as on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are disclosed in note commitments to extend credit of this report and totaled million at december   compared to million at december  normally these commitments have fixed expiration dates or termination clauses and are for specific purposes 

table of contents accordingly  many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn and therefore  generally do not present significant liquidity risk to the corporation or peoplesbank 
impact of inflation and changing prices the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation may impact the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation may also significantly affect noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
the level of inflation can be measured by the change in the consumer price index cpi for all urban consumers december vs 
december 
the change in the cpi for was percent  compared to percent for and percent for management believes that the most significant impact on financial results is the corporation s ability to react to changes in market interest rates 
management strives to structure the balance sheet to increase net interest income by managing interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to reprice in response to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  management is focused on increasing fee income  an income component that is less sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not applicable to smaller reporting companies

the corporation s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
management assessed the effectiveness of the corporation s internal control over financial reporting as of december   using the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework  with an emphasis on internal control over financial reporting guidance for smaller public companies  also issued by coso 
based on this assessment  management concluded that  as of december   the corporation s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria
