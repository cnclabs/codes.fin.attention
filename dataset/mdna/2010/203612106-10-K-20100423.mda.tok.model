table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general community bankers trust corporation the company is a bank holding company that was incorporated under delaware law on april  the company is headquartered in glen allen  virginia and is the holding company for essex bank the bank  a virginia state bank with full service offices in virginia  maryland and georgia 
the bank changed its name from bank of essex to essex bank on april  the bank was established in and is headquartered in tappahannock  virginia 
the bank engages in a general commercial banking business and provides a wide range of financial services primarily to individuals and small businesses  including individual and commercial demand and time deposit accounts  commercial and consumer loans  travelers checks  safe deposit box facilities  investment services and fixed rate residential mortgages 
fourteen offices are located in virginia  primarily from the chesapeake bay to just west of richmond  seven are located in maryland along the baltimore washington corridor and four are located in the atlanta  georgia metropolitan market 
the company generates a significant amount of its income from the net interest income earned by the bank 
net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense 
interest income depends on the amount of interest earning assets outstanding during the period and the interest rates earned thereon 
the company s cost of funds is a function of the average amount of interest bearing deposits and borrowed money outstanding during the period and the interest rates paid thereon 
the quality of the assets further influences the amount of interest income lost on non accrual loans and the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses 
additionally  the bank earns non interest income from service charges on deposit accounts and other fee or commission based services and products 
other sources of non interest income can include gains or losses on securities transactions  gains from loan sales  transactions involving bank owned property  and income from bank owned life insurance boli policies 
the company s income is offset by non interest expense  which consists of goodwill impairment and other charges  salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  professional fees  and other operational expenses 
the provision for loan losses and income taxes materially affect income

critical accounting policies the following is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan and lease losses on non covered loans the allowance for loan and lease losses alll is maintained at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired  as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio 
since arriving at an appropriate alll involves a high degree of management judgment  an ongoing quarterly analysis to develop a range of estimated losses is utilized 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  best estimates within the range of potential credit loss to determine the appropriate alll is utilized 
credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the alll 
the company utilizes an internal risk grading system for its loans 
those larger credits that exhibit probable or well defined credit weaknesses are subject to individual review 
the borrower s cash flow  adequacy of collateral coverage  and other options available to the company  including legal remedies  are evaluated 
the review of individual loans includes those loans that are impaired as defined by fasb asc  receivables 
collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for loss provision is considered 
historical loss rates are applied to other loans not subject to specific allocations 
the loss rates are determined from historical net charge offs experienced by the bank 
historical loss rates for commercial and retail loans are adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors that are considered include delinquency trends  current economic conditions and trends  strength of supervision and administration of the loan portfolio  levels of underperforming loans  level of recoveries to prior year s charge offs  trend in loan losses  industry concentrations and their relative strengths  amount of unsecured loans and underwriting exceptions 
these factors are reviewed quarterly and a weighted score is assigned depending on the level and extent of the risk 
the total of each of these weighted factors is then applied against the applicable portion of the portfolio and the alll is adjusted to ensure an appropriate level 
allowance for loan and lease losses on covered loans the assets acquired in the sfsb acquisition are covered by a shared loss agreement with the fdic 
under the shared loss agreements  the fdic will reimburse the bank for of losses arising from covered loans and foreclosed real estate assets  on the first million in losses of such covered loans and foreclosed real estate assets  and for of losses on covered loans and foreclosed real estate assets thereafter 
under the shared loss agreements  a loss on a covered loan or foreclosed real estate is defined generally as a realized loss incurred through a permitted disposition  foreclosure  short sale or restructuring of the covered loan or foreclosed real estate 
the reimbursements for losses on single family one to four residential mortgage loans are to be made monthly until the end of the month in which the tenth anniversary of the closing of the transaction occurs  and the reimbursements for losses on other covered assets are to be made quarterly until the end of the quarter in which the eighth anniversary of the closing of the transaction occurs 
the shared loss agreements provide for indemnification from the first dollar of losses without any threshold requirement 
the reimbursable losses from the fdic are based on the book value of the relevant loan as determined by the fdic at the date of the transaction  january  new loans made after that date are not covered by the shared loss agreements 
the company evaluated the acquired covered loans and has elected to account for them under asc the covered loans acquired are subject to credit review standards described above for non covered loans 
if and when credit deterioration occurs subsequent to the acquisition date  a provision for credit loss for covered loans will be charged to earnings for the full amount without regard to the fdic shared loss agreements 
the company makes an estimate of the total cash flows it expects to collect from a pool of covered loans  which includes undiscounted expected principal and interest 
over the life of the loan or pool  the company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
subsequent decreases in cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the pool are recognized as an impairment in the current period through allowance for loan loss 
subsequent increases in expected cash flows are first used to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool 
any remaining increase in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized as an adjustment to the yield over the remaining life of the pool 
fdic indemnification asset the company is accounting for the shared loss agreements as an indemnification asset pursuant to the guidance in fasb asc the fdic indemnification asset is required to be measured in the same manner as the asset or liability to which it relates 
the fdic indemnification asset is measured separately from the covered loans and other real estate owned assets because it is not contractually embedded in the covered loan and other real estate owned assets and is not transferable should the company choose to dispose of them 
fair value was estimated using projected cash flows available for loss sharing based on the credit adjustments estimated for each loan pool and other real estate owned and the loss sharing percentages outlined in the purchase and assumption agreements with the fdic 
these cash flows were discounted to reflect the uncertainty of the timing and receipt of the loss sharing reimbursement from the fdic 
because the acquired loans are subject to a fdic loss sharing agreement and a corresponding indemnification asset exists to represent the value of expected payments from the fdic  increases and decreases in loan accretable yield due to changing loss expectations will also have an impact to the valuation of the fdic indemnification asset 
improvement in loss expectations will typically increase loan accretable yield and decrease the value of the fdic indemnification asset  and in some instances  result in an amortizable premium on the fdic indemnification asset 
increases in loss expectations will typically be recognized as impairment in the current period through allowance for loan losses while resulting in additional non interest income for the amount of the increase in the fdic indemnification asset 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets the company adopted fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and others 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill impairment charges of million were realized in additionally  under asc  acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles are separately recognized if the benefit of the assets can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their useful lives 
any branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of asc and  accordingly  intangible assets related to such transactions continued to amortize upon the adoption of asc the costs of purchased deposit relationships and other intangible assets  based on independent valuation by a qualified third party  are being amortized over their estimated lives 
core deposit intangible amortization expense charged to operations was million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  the company did not record any goodwill or other intangible prior to the tfc and boe mergers 
overview as of december   the company had total assets aggregating billion versus billion at the prior year end  representing an increase of million  or

results of operations net income for reflects a full twelve months for the company of consolidated operations for the holding company and the banking subsidiary  while net income for reflects five months for the company and seven months of consolidated operations for the holding company and the banking subsidiary 
net income for is reflective of the nine month period from april  to december  for the holding company only  which did not have any operations 
the company changed accounting year end in  thus resulting in the nine month operating period 
it is important to note that prior year comparisons should be viewed with realization of twelve months of bank operations in  seven months of bank operations in and  no bank operating activity in from its inception until consummation of the acquisitions of tfc and boe on may   the company was a special purpose acquisition company  as described above  and had no substantial operations 
accordingly  since the company s operating activities prior to the acquisitions were insignificant relative to those of tfc and boe  management believes that both tfc and boe are the company s predecessors 
management has reached this conclusion based upon an evaluation of facts and circumstances  including the historical life of each of tfc and boe  the historical level of operations of each of tfc and boe  the purchase price paid for each of tfc and boe and the fact that the consolidated company s operations  revenues and expenses after the acquisitions are most similar in all respects to those of tfc s and boe s historical periods 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements for the predecessor entities for the five months ended may  and the year ended december  have been presented 
net income for the year ended december   the company recorded a net loss available to common shareholders of million compared with net income of million for basic and fully diluted earnings per share were for versus for  respectively

net charged offs totaled million in versus  in total non performing non covered assets equaled and of total non covered loans and non covered other real estate at december  and  respectively 

table of contents net interest income the company s operating results depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  including securities and loans  and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and other borrowed funds 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
for the year ended december   net interest income was million  which generated a tax equivalent net interest margin of 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
the bank s net interest margin improved basis points during from in primarily from improved yields on earning assets 
most notably  the yields related to the fair market value of loans acquired from sfsb enhanced the margin 
concurrently  management proactively managed the deposit base in three states lowering the overall cost of funds during the year 
interest and fees on non covered loans increased million or to aggregate million during interest and fee income on covered loans equaled million during in total  loan interest income continues to be the largest component driving the net interest margin 
total interest expense totaled million during of which interest on deposits was million 
this compares with million and million  respectively in net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared with million in  which was comprised solely of interest income on us treasury securities 
interest and fee income on loans equaled million at december  and represented the largest component of interest income  despite a relatively low volume of loans relative to deposits at december  total interest expense was primarily driven by deposit expense of million during the company s total loan to deposit ratio was at december  versus at december  the ratio increased during due to the new loans acquired during the sfsb acquisition  yet remains nominal relative to industry standards 
as noted in the prior year  this ratio was affected during the fourth quarter of by the tcb transaction which accounted for million of deposits at december  these excess funds were immediately invested in u

the most notable impetus for the provision was evidenced in one borrowing relationship which was previously impaired and on the bank s watch list 
current information related to unwinding that credit necessitated further impairment which amounted to approximately of the provision during the third quarter and subsequent charge off in the fourth quarter 
after a million charge off in the fourth quarter  the amount of this loan outstanding at december  was million  with specific allowance of  the loan was placed on non accrual status during june of the loan  classified as commercial residential real estate development which was originated approximately years ago  is collateralized by real estate 
the most recent appraisal on the underlying collateral dated april equaled million 
other evaluation procedures included discussions with professionals knowledgeable with similar developments and potential buyers and sellers 
the remaining balance of the provision during the third and fourth quarters of the year was attributable to downgraded credits and further insulation from the economic downturn 
management continues to monitor the loan portfolio closely and make appropriate adjustments using the company s internal risk rating system 
while the maryland loan portfolio contains significant risk  it was considered in determining the initial fair value  which was reflected in adjustments recorded at the time of the sfsb transaction  less the fdic guaranteed portion of losses on covered assets 
net charge off activity has increased during recent quarters  a trend that is expected to continue until economic conditions improve

the substantial difference in income tax expense during relative to net operating loss is directly attributable to the goodwill impairement charges taken during the year and the company s inability to use it as a tax deduction  despite the substantial reduction to earnings 
the reduced income tax provision as a percentage of taxable income during was due in part to a net operating loss carry forward afforded by the former tfc and by the addition of nontaxable interest income on bank qualified state  county  and municipal securities 

table of contents asset quality non covered assets the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of the amount appropriate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
non covered loan quality is continually monitored  and the company s management has established an allowance for loan losses that it believes is appropriate for the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
among other factors  management considers the company s historical loss experience  the size and composition of the covered loan portfolio  the value and appropriateness of collateral and guarantors  non performing credits and current and anticipated economic conditions 
there are additional risks of future loan losses  which cannot be precisely quantified nor attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because those risks include general economic trends  as well as conditions affecting individual borrowers  the allowance for loan losses is an estimate 
the allowance is also subject to regulatory examinations and determination as to appropriateness  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and size of the allowance in comparison to peer companies identified by regulatory agencies 
the company maintains a list of non covered loans that have potential weaknesses which may need special attention 
this nonperforming loan list is used to monitor such loans and is used in the determination of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   nonperforming assets totaled million and net charge offs were million 
this compares with nonperforming assets of million and net charge offs of  for the year ended december  nonperforming loans increased million during  primarily attributable to eight credit relationships aggregating approximately million being placed in nonaccrual status

accordingly  acquired impaired loans that are contractually past due are still considered to be accruing and performing loans 
the company makes an estimate of the total cash flows it expects to collect from a pool of covered loans  which includes undiscounted expected principal and interest 
over the life of the loan or pool  the company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected 
subsequent decreases in cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the pool are recognized as an impairment in the current period through allowance for loan losses 
subsequent increases in expected cash flows are first used to reverse any existing valuation allowance for that loan or pool 
any remaining increase in cash flows expected to be collected is recognized as an adjustment to the yield over the remaining life of the pool

table of contents capital requirements the determination of capital adequacy depends upon a number of factors  such as asset quality  liquidity  earnings  growth trends and economic conditions 
the company seeks to maintain a strong capital base to support its growth and expansion plans  provide stability to current operations and promote public confidence in the company 
the federal banking regulators have defined three tests for assessing the capital strength and adequacy of banks  based on two definitions of capital 
tier capital is defined as a combination of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity less goodwill 
tier capital is defined as qualifying subordinated debt and a portion of the allowance for loan losses 
total capital is defined as tier capital plus tier capital 
three risk based capital ratios are computed using the above capital definitions  total assets and risk weighted assets and are measured against regulatory minimums to ascertain adequacy 
all assets and off balance sheet risk items are grouped into categories according to degree of risk and assigned a risk weighting and the resulting total is risk weighted assets 
tier risk based capital is tier capital divided by risk weighted assets 
total risk based capital is total capital divided by risk weighted assets 
the leverage ratio is tier capital divided by total average assets 

table of contents the company s ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets was on december  the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was on december  the company s leverage ratio tier capital to average adjusted total assets was on december  it is important to note that the decline in the leverage ratio for the year was the direct result of adding assets to the balance sheet for the sfsb transaction 
while these assets are partially guaranteed by the fdic  this ratio does not adjust average assets accordingly for the covered risk associated with the fdic guarantee

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the corporation s asset and liability management committee alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to this risk 
the board of directors reviews and approves the guidelines established by alco 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of two complimentary modeling tools earnings simulation modeling and economic value simulation net present value estimation 
each of these models measures changes in a variety of interest rate scenarios 
while each of the interest rate risk measures has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  the distribution of risk along the yield curve  the level of risk through time  and the amount of exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
earnings simulation and economic value models  which more effectively measure the cash flow and optionality impacts  are utilized by management on a regular basis and are explained below 
earnings simulation analysis management uses simulation analysis to measure the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the model calculates an earnings estimate based on current and projected balances and rates 
this method is subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that management has input  but it provides a better analysis of the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates than other potential analyses 
assumptions used in the model are derived from historical trends and management s outlook and include loan and deposit growth rates and projected yields and rates 
such assumptions are monitored and periodically adjusted as appropriate 
all maturities  calls and prepayments in the securities portfolio are assumed to be reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities prepayment assumptions are based on industry estimates of prepayment speeds for portfolios with similar coupon ranges and seasoning 
different interest rate scenarios and yield curves are used to measure the sensitivity of earnings to changing interest rates 
interest rates on different asset and liability accounts move differently when the prime rate changes and are reflected in the different rate scenarios 
the corporation uses its simulation model to estimate earnings in rate environments where rates ramp up or down around a most likely rate scenario  based on implied forward rates 
the analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month time horizon by applying month shock versus the implied forward rates of basis points up and down 
the following table represents the interest rate sensitivity on net interest income for the corporation across the rate paths modeled as of december change in net interest income dollars in thousands change in yield curve bp bp most likely bp bp
