item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we have reclassified certain items previously reported to conform with the presentation for the year ended december  effective january   we modified the presentation of expenses on the consolidated statement of operations  expanding the presentation to include separate line items for selling  general and administrative expenses  and other income expense  net 
prior to the modification  the consolidated statements of operations included a line item for general and administrative expenses  which reflected only the expenses associated with our corporate office  while all operating segment expenses were reported within cost of revenues 
following this reclassification  selling  general and administrative expenses includes all expenses of this nature from our operating segments as well as our corporate office 
as a result of this reclassification  million and million of expenses previously reported in cost of revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  are now reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
overview we are a diversified oil and gas industry supplier  and have three reportable segments fluids systems and engineering  mats and integrated services  and environmental services 
we provide these products and services principally to the e p industry domestically in the us gulf coast  west texas  oklahoma  east texas  north louisiana  rocky mountains  and northeast regions  as well as internationally in certain areas of europe  north africa  brazil  canada and mexico 
further  we are expanding our presence outside the e p sector through our mats and integrated services segment  where we are marketing to utilities  municipalities and government sectors  both domestically and internationally 
our operating results depend  to a large extent  on oil and gas drilling activity levels in the markets we serve  as well as the depth of drilling  which governs the revenue potential of each well 
the drilling activity in turn  depends on oil and gas commodity pricing  inventory levels and product demand 
the weak economic environment  the instability in the credit markets and declines in oil and natural gas commodity prices significantly impacted north american drilling activity in  as compared to previous years 
after significantly declining in the first half of  north american drilling activity began to stabilize and improve modestly during the second half of this decline in e p drilling activity negatively impacted our operating results as compared to the results achieved during and rig count data is the most widely accepted indicator of drilling activity 
key average north american rig count data for the last three years ended december is as follows year ended december  vs vs count count us rig count canadian rig count total source baker hughes incorporated in response to the significant declines in activity and the increased price competition in  we executed cost reduction programs including workforce reductions  reduced discretionary spending  salary reductions for substantially all north american employees including executive officers  the temporary elimination of k matching for us employees  as well as reductions in capital expenditures in north america 
as part of this cost reduction program  we reduced our north american workforce by employees  or  during  in addition to eliminating substantially all contract employee positions 
as a result of these workforce reductions  operating results for include million of charges associated with employee termination and related exit costs  substantially all of which was incurred during the first half of the year 

table of contents hurricane impact during  our environmental services and fluids systems and engineering operations along the us gulf coast were impacted by hurricanes gustav and ike  which interrupted business activities 
during  we recorded million of other income within our environmental services segment  associated with the settlement and collection of business interruption insurance claims from the storms

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses declined million to million in from million in the decrease includes million in fluids systems and engineering  million in mat and integrated services  million in environmental services  and million in the corporate office 
the decline in corporate office spending includes million of legal and selling costs associated with the abandoned sale of the environmental services business along with million of expenses associated with the arbitration and settlement of a lawsuit with our former chief executive officer  both which were recorded in the remainder of the 
table of contents decrease in all segments is attributable to the impact of cost reduction programs implemented during  as well as lower performance based employee incentive costs in other income expense  net other income  net was million in compared to million of other expense  net in the results include million of income associated with the settlement of business interruption insurance claims within our environmental services business  resulting from hurricanes and storms in the results include a million charge to write down certain disposal assets within the environmental services segment  following the abandoned sale of the business in the fourth quarter of interest expense interest expense totaled million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is attributable to lower debt levels  as total outstanding debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
our weighted average borrowing rate under our credit facilities increased to at december  compared to a weighted average borrowing rate of at december  in july  we entered into the first amendment which included adjustments in interest rates under our credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources below for additional information 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for was a million benefit  reflecting an income tax rate of  compared to million of expense for  reflecting an income tax rate of 
the low effective tax rate in is primarily due to current year losses generated in certain foreign countries  for which recording a tax benefit is not permitted  as well as the recording of valuation allowances against a previously recognized net operating loss carryforward tax asset in canada  which serve to reduce the effective tax benefit rate in the period 
operating segment results summarized financial information for our reportable segments is shown in the following table net of inter segment transfers year ended december  vs in thousands revenues fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services total revenues operating loss income fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services corporate office operating loss income segment operating margin fluids systems and engineering mats and integrated services environmental services 
table of contents fluids systems and engineering revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands drilling fluids and engineering completion fluids and services industrial minerals total north america mediterranean brazil total north america revenues decreased to million in  as compared to million in drilling fluids and engineering revenues decreased  which is largely attributable to the decline in industry drilling activity noted above  along with increased pricing pressure resulting from the depressed activity levels 
north american completion fluids and services and wholesale industrial minerals revenues were down a combined  also driven by the lower industry activity and pricing pressure 
mediterranean revenues decreased in compared to  due to the impact of the strengthening us dollar  as revenue levels increased in local currency terms from to brazil revenues increased to million in  reflecting the ramp up in activity under contracts entered into during operating income operating income for this segment decreased million in compared to  on a million decrease in revenues 
the majority of this decline is attributable to the north american operations  which generated an million decline in operating income on a million decrease in revenues 
this decrease in operating income is the result of the decline in north american drilling activity in  and the related increase in pricing pressure from competition 
further  the benefits of cost reduction initiatives taken during had limited impact on full year results due to the timing of the actions  which resulted in only partial year benefits to  along with million of charges associated with employee termination and related costs  as the north american workforce of this business was reduced by employees during this period 
operating income was further negatively impacted by lower gross profit on industrial mineral sales 
following the execution of significant cost reduction programs in the first half of  and the stabilization of north american rig activity during the second half of  the north american operating income improved from the levels generated during the first half of the year 
specifically  north american operating income in this segment increased by million from the first half of to the second half of operating income from international operations decreased million on a million increase in revenues 
the mediterranean region operating income increased million during this period  however  this increase was more than offset by a million decrease in brazil 
the operating loss in brazil is the result of the ramp up in personnel and facility costs for this operation  in advance of future anticipated revenues under existing contracts  along with an unfavorable sales mix 

table of contents mats and integrated services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and integrated services mat sales total the million decrease in mat rental and integrated services revenues in is primarily attributable to declines in the us market served by this segment  particularly in the us gulf coast region 
the decline in revenue is further impacted by the increased pricing competition following the declines in market activity  and timing of projects from customers outside the e p industry 
mat sales primarily consist of export sales of composite mats to various international markets  as well as to non oilfield industries domestically 
mat sales decreased by million to million in compared to the year over year decline is driven by reduced demand for these products from the e p and utility industries  as well as governmental sectors in the current economic environment 
operating income mats and integrated services operating income decreased by million in  on a million decrease in revenues compared to the decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to the declines in revenues and pricing pressures  which was partially offset by cost reductions 
the benefits of cost reduction initiatives taken during  including workforce reductions of employees  had a limited impact on the full year operating results  due to the timing of the actions  which resulted in only partial year benefits to  along with million of charges associated with employee termination costs and million of non cash write downs of inventory 
of the million operating loss generated by this segment in  million was generated during the first half of the year  during which time the cost reduction actions were being executed 
we have evaluated the carrying values of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of the evaluation included consideration of the significant declines in revenues and profitability in  along with the impact of cost reduction programs and forecasted cash flow projections for each reporting unit 
in completing this analysis  we determined that no reporting unit has a fair value below its net carrying value 
however  our analysis estimated that the fair value of the mats and integrated services reporting unit exceeded net carrying value by less than 
as noted above  this segment generated an operating loss of million in the first half of  during which time the business unit was executing on significant cost reduction actions in response to the market declines 
following the completion of these actions  the financial performance of this business unit improved significantly  generating revenues of million and an operating profit of million in the fourth quarter of our estimated fair value is determined using a combination of a market multiple and discounted cash flow approach  using internally developed forecasts for the business unit 
deterioration in the operating income and cash flows provided by this reporting unit could potentially result in impairments of goodwill 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet includes million of goodwill for the mats and integrated services segment

this decline in volumes processed was partially offset by changes in sales mix and pricing increases 
e p waste revenues in west texas decreased by to million in compared to million in the decline in revenues is driven by a decrease in volumes processed during this period along with a decline in revenues from the sale of oil  which is recovered as part of the waste disposal process 
norm and industrial waste revenues increased by to million in  compared to million in this increase is driven by higher volumes processed  as activity levels tend to fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the timing of customer projects 
operating income environmental services operating income decreased by million on a million decline in revenues in  compared to the results include million of income associated with the settlement of business interruption insurance claims resulting from hurricanes and storms in the results include a million charge to write down certain disposal assets  following the abandoned sale of the business in the fourth quarter of the remaining decline of million is attributable to the lower revenue levels  partially offset by million of operating expense reductions  including reductions in transportation costs  personnel expenses  and rent expense following the non renewal of barge leases during the second half of

revenues in our completion fluids and services business increased in as compared to  due to strong demand for rental equipment and services for well completion activities in the oklahoma and texas areas served by this business 
revenues in our industrial minerals business increased in  as compared to  resulting from a increase in sales volume  along with significant pricing increases to help offset higher barite transportation costs 
mediterranean revenues increased from to  which was largely driven by the increased rig activity and continued market penetration into the north african and eastern european markets 
revenues generated in brazil in increased million following the start up of this business unit 
operating income operating income for this segment increased million in on a million increase in revenues  compared to  resulting in a decrease in operating margin from to 
of the total segment change  north american operations generated a million increase in operating income on a million increase in revenues  while international operations generated a million increase in operating income on a million increase in revenues 
within the international operations  the incremental profits associated with higher revenues were somewhat offset by higher operating expenses attributable to personnel  higher transportation and logistics costs due to the location of projects  and start up costs associated with new contracts 
mats and integrated services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands mat rental and integrated services mat sales total 
table of contents mat rental and integrated services revenues decreased by million in compared to  as a million increase in revenues generated by the colorado business acquired in august was more than offset by a million decline in rental and related service volume in the us gulf coast region  driven largely by weakness in the south louisiana land rig count in compared to mat sales primarily consist of export sales of composite mats to various international markets  as well as domestic sales to the us government and customers outside the oil and gas industry 
mat sales increased by million in  as compared to  due primarily to higher domestic sales activity 
operating income mats and integrated services operating income decreased by million to million for on a million decrease in revenues compared to  resulting in a decrease in operating margin to from 
the decrease in operating margin is partially attributable to the change in sales mix 
the colorado business acquired in august generated an increase in rental and service revenues of million in  however  operating income from this business were unchanged over this period  as incremental profits generated by the higher revenues were offset by higher expenses  including a million increase in depreciation and amortization related to acquired assets 
operating income for the remaining operations in this segment  which primarily service the us gulf coast area  declined by million on a million decline in revenue 
as noted above  this million decline in revenue included a million decrease in rental and integrated services revenue  offset by a million increase in mat sales 
the decline in us gulf coast operating income is primarily due to the lower rental and integrated service revenues  as these activities have a relatively high fixed cost structure 
in addition  the us gulf coast service business was negatively impacted by additional pricing pressure resulting from the significantly lower rig counts in the region throughout also  the business recorded million of pre tax charges in related primarily to inventory and receivable write downs  transportation costs for the re deployment of rental mats  as well as severance and related costs associated with restructuring activities in this segment 
environmental services revenues total revenues for this segment consisted of the following year ended december  vs in thousands e p waste gulf coast e p waste west texas norm and industrial waste total e p waste revenues in the us gulf coast region decreased to million in compared to volumes processed by this region declined during this period  reflective of the decline in us gulf coast rig activity during this period 
this decline in volumes processed was partially offset by changes in sales mix and pricing increases 
e p waste revenues in west texas increased by to million in compared to volumes processed by this region declined during this period  however  this was more than offset by improvements in pricing 
also  this region generated million of additional revenues from the sale of oil  which is a by product of the waste disposal process 
the increase in oil revenues is the result of the high commodity prices experienced during norm and industrial waste revenues increased by to million in compared to

the operating income included a million charge to write down certain disposal assets which we decided not to develop following the abandoned sale of the business in the fourth quarter of in addition  includes million of expenses associated with unrecoverable losses incurred at our us gulf coast facilities associated with hurricanes ike and gustav 
the remaining million increase in operating income reflects the impact of the higher revenues 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities in totaled million 
the net loss adjusted for non cash items generated million of cash during the period  while decreases in working capital provided million of cash 
the decrease in working capital during the year includes million from decreases in receivables and million from decreases in inventories  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts payable and a million decrease in accrued liabilities and other 
all of these changes are primarily due to lower sales levels and our lower purchasing and spending activities 
net cash used in investing activities during in was million  consisting primarily of capital expenditures which included million for our operations outside of north america 
net cash used in financing activities in was million  reflecting net payments made on our credit facility during the period 
during  our total debt balance was reduced by million to million at december  in the near term  we anticipate that our debt requirements will be primarily driven by working capital needs  which will increase if revenue increases over current levels 
our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
cash generated by operations  along with availability under our existing credit agreement is expected to be adequate to fund our anticipated capital needs 
our capitalization was as follows as of december in thousands term loan revolving credit facility foreign bank lines of credit other total stockholder s equity total capitalization total debt to capitalization 
table of contents in december  we entered into a million amended and restated credit agreement credit agreement with a five year term  expiring in december the credit agreement consisted of a million revolving credit facility and a million term loan  which is to be repaid through annual principal payments of million which began in december the credit agreement contained certain financial covenants including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  and a maximum funded debt to capitalization ratio 
at june   we were not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio covenants 
however  in july  we entered into the first amendment  which provided a waiver of the financial covenant violations as of june  and modified certain covenant requirements in future periods  as follows december  march  june  thereafter fixed charge coverage ratio minimum consolidated leverage ratio maximum historically  our performance for financial covenant compliance purposes was based on our trailing four fiscal quarter results 
under the first amendment  financial covenant calculations utilize annualized results beginning with the third quarter of  and continuing through march   after which time the calculations will return to using trailing four fiscal quarter results 
we were in compliance with these modified covenants as of december   and expect to remain in compliance through december  the calculated performance for these covenants as of december   is as follows calculation as of covenant december  requirement fixed charge coverage ratio minimum consolidated leverage ratio maximum funded debt to captalization ratio maximum the first amendment also reduced the revolving credit facility from million to million  and provided for adjustments in the interest rates and commitment fees under the credit facility 
under the credit agreement  as amended by the first amendment  we can elect to borrow at an interest rate either based on libor plus a margin based on our consolidated leverage ratio  ranging from to basis points  or at an interest rate based on the greatest of a prime rate  b the federal funds rate in effect plus basis points  or c the eurodollar rate for a eurodollar loan with a one month interest period plus basis points  in each case plus a margin ranging from to basis points 
the first amendment also increased the commitment fee rate payable under the credit facility  which is now fixed at basis points 
the applicable margin on libor borrowings at december  was basis points 
as of december   million of the outstanding principal of the revolving credit facility was bearing interest at libor plus basis points  or  while the remaining million in outstanding principal was bearing interest at prime rate plus basis points  or 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the underlying libor rate on our borrowings under the term loan 
the initial notional amount of the swap agreements totaled million  reducing by million each december  matching the required principal repayments under the term loan 
as a result of the swap agreements  we will pay a fixed rate of over the term of the loan plus the applicable libor margin  which was basis points at december  the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balances under our credit agreement including the interest rate swaps as of december  and was and  respectively 

table of contents the credit agreement is a senior secured obligation  secured by first liens on all of our us tangible and intangible assets  including our accounts receivable and inventory 
additionally  a portion of the capital stock of our non us subsidiaries has also been pledged as collateral 
our foreign fluid systems and engineering subsidiaries in italy and brazil maintain local credit arrangements consisting primarily of lines of credit with several banks  which are renewed on an annual basis 
we utilize local financing arrangements in our foreign operations in order to preserve credit availability under our corporate credit agreement  as well as to reduce the net investment in foreign operations subject to foreign currency risk 
advances under these short term credit arrangements are typically based on a percentage of the subsidiary s accounts receivable or firm contracts with certain customers 
the weighted average interest rate for the million balance outstanding under these arrangements was at december  at december   million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding domestically  including million related to our insurance programs 
in addition  we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  the outstanding balance and letters of credit under our credit facility leave million of availability at december  additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding relating to foreign operations 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with our insurance programs  we had established letters of credit in favor of certain insurance companies in the amount of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  as of december  and  we had established other letters of credit in favor of our suppliers in the amount of million and million  respectively 
we also had million in guarantee obligations in connection with facility closure bonds and other performance bonds issued by insurance companies and outstanding as of december  and other than normal operating leases for office and warehouse space  barges  rolling stock and other pieces of operating equipment  we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or special purpose entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such financing arrangements 
contractual obligations a summary of our outstanding contractual and other obligations and commitments at december  is as follows in thousands thereafter total current maturities of long term debt long term debt including capital leases foreign bank lines of credit operating leases trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities purchase commitments  not accrued other long term liabilities performance bond obligations letter of credit commitments total contractual obligations the above table does not reflect expected tax payments and unrecognized tax benefits due to the inability to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing and amount to be paid 
for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits  see note income taxes to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item in this report 

table of contents we anticipate that the obligations and commitments listed above that are due in less than one year will be paid from operating cash flows and availability under our existing credit agreement 
the specific timing of settlement for certain long term obligations can not be reasonably estimated 
critical accounting policies critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted within the united states us gaap  which requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts and disclosures reported 
significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include the following allowances for sales returns  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for self insured retentions under insurance programs  estimated performance and values associated with employee incentive programs  fair values used for goodwill impairment testing  undiscounted cash flows used for impairment testing of long lived assets and valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on our future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our current estimates and those differences may be material 
we believe the critical accounting policies described below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are determined on a specific identification basis when we believe that the required payment of specific amounts owed to us is not probable 
the majority of our revenues are from mid sized and international oil companies as well as government owned or government controlled oil companies  and we have receivables in several foreign jurisdictions 
changes in the financial condition of our customers or political changes in foreign jurisdictions could cause our customers to be unable to repay these receivables  resulting in additional allowances 
for  and  provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable were million  million and million  respectively 
allowance for sales returns we maintain reserves for estimated customer returns of unused materials in our fluids systems and engineering segment 
the reserves are established based upon historical customer return levels and estimated gross profit levels attributable to product sales 
future customer return levels may differ from the historical return rate 
impairments of long lived assets goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of november  or more frequently  if an indication of impairment exists 
the impairment test includes a comparison of the carrying value of net assets of our reporting units  including goodwill  with their estimated fair values  which we determine using a combination of a market multiple and discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which such review is performed 
we identify our reporting units based on our analysis of several factors  including our operating segment structure  evaluation of the economic characteristics of our geographic regions within each of our operating segments  and the extent to which our business units share assets and other resources 
our annual evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was completed during the fourth quarter of the evaluation included consideration of the significant declines in revenues and profitability encountered in  along with the impact of cost reduction programs and forecasted cash flow projections for each reporting unit 
in completing this evaluation  we determined that no reporting unit has a fair value below its net carrying value 
however  while our analysis indicated that the fair value of our drilling fluids business remains significantly in excess of carrying value  our mats and integrated services reporting unit exceeded net carrying value 
table of contents by less that 
deterioration in the operating income and cash flows provided by this reporting unit could potentially result in requirement impairments in goodwill 
at december   the consolidated balance sheet includes million of goodwill for the mats and integrated services segment 
we review property  plant and equipment  finite lived intangible assets and certain other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we assess recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flows 
in estimating expected cash flows  we use a probability weighted approach 
should the review indicate that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the amount of impairment loss is determined by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
insurance we maintain reserves for estimated future payments associated with our self insured employee healthcare programs  as well as the self insured retention exposures under our general liability  auto liability and workers compensation insurance policies 
our reserves are determined based on historical cost experience under these programs  including estimated development of known claims under these programs and estimated incurred but not reported claims 
required reserves could change significantly based upon changes in insurance coverage  loss experience or inflationary impacts 
as of december  and  total insurance reserves were million and million  respectively 
income taxes we have total deferred tax assets of million at december  a valuation allowance must be established to offset a deferred tax asset if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for our valuation allowance 
at december   a total valuation allowance of million was recorded  substantially all of which offsets million of net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes  as well as foreign jurisdictions  including canada  brazil and mexico 
no valuation allowance is recorded for our us net operating loss carryforward 
changes in the expected future generation of qualifying taxable income within these jurisdictions or in the realizability of other tax assets  may result in an adjustment to the valuation allowance  which would be charged or credited to income in the period this determination was made 
specifically  we have a million valuation allowance recorded on the net operating loss carryforward in brazil which could be reversed in the near future  depending on our ability to generate taxable income 
new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued additional guidance on multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the guidance provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
it replaces the term fair value in the revenue allocation guidance with selling price to clarify that the allocation of revenue is based on entity specific assumptions rather than assumptions of a marketplace participant  and they establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
the amendments eliminate the residual method of allocation and require that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method  and they significantly expand the required disclosures related to multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the amendments will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning after june  and we do not expect the impact of this statement to be material 
on october   we adopted new accounting guidance relating to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the guidance provides clarification in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for when an identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using a a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities and or b an income approach valuation technique or a market approach valuation technique 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents on september   we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the fasb  which established the fasb accounting standards codification  a new source of authoritative accounting principles applicable to nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap known as the codification 
the codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place 
as of the effective date  all existing non sec accounting standard documents were superseded 
on january   we adopted new accounting guidance relating to changes in the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
entities are required to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see note fair value of financial instruments and concentrations of credit risk to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item in this report for additional details on our derivative instruments and hedging activities 
on january   we adopted new accounting guidance regarding factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the objective of the new guidance is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on january   we adopted revised accounting guidance on the accounting for acquisitions of businesses 
the revision changed the previous guidance  requiring that all acquired assets  liabilities  minority interest and certain contingencies be measured at fair value  and certain other acquisition related costs be expensed rather than capitalized 
the revised guidance applies to acquisitions that were effective after december   and application of the standard to acquisitions prior to that date was not permitted 
the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency rates 
a discussion of our primary market risk exposure in financial instruments is presented below 
interest rate risk our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had total debt outstanding of million 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to effectively fix the underlying libor interest rate on our borrowings under the term loan portion of our credit facility
