separation from cendant on july   cendant corporation  currently known as avis budget group  inc or former parent  distributed all of the shares of wyndham common stock to the holders of cendant common stock issued and outstanding on july   the record date for the distribution 
on august   we commenced regular way trading on the new york stock exchange under the symbol wyn 
before our separation from cendant  we entered into separation  transition services and several other agreements with cendant  realogy and travelport to effect the separation and distribution  govern the relationships among the parties after the separation and allocate among the parties cendant s assets  liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to the separation 
under the separation and distribution agreement  we assumed of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of cendant or its subsidiaries which were not primarily related to our business or the businesses of realogy  travelport or avis budget group  and realogy assumed of these contingent and other corporate liabilities 
these include liabilities relating to cendant s terminated or divested businesses  the travelport sale on august   taxes of travelport for taxable periods through the date of the travelport sale  certain litigation matters  generally any actions relating to the separation plan and payments under certain contracts that were not allocated to any specific party in connection with the separation 
as a result of the sale of realogy on april   realogy s senior debt credit rating was downgraded to below investment grade 
under the separation agreement  if realogy experienced such a change of control and suffered such a ratings downgrade  it was required to post a letter of credit in an amount acceptable to us and avis budget group to satisfy the fair value of realogy s indemnification obligations for the cendant legacy contingent liabilities in the event realogy does not otherwise satisfy such obligations to the extent they become due 
on april   realogy posted a million irrevocable standby letter of credit from a major commercial bank in favor of avis budget group and upon which demand may be made if realogy does not otherwise satisfy its obligations for its share of the cendant legacy contingent liabilities 
the letter of credit can be adjusted from time to time based upon the outstanding contingent liabilities and has an expiration date of september  subject to renewal and certain provisions 
as such  on august   the letter of credit was reduced to million 
the issuance of this letter of credit does not relieve or limit realogy s obligations for these liabilities 
results of operations lodging our franchising business is designed to generate revenues for our hotel owners through the delivery of room night bookings to the hotel  the promotion of brand awareness among the consumer base  global sales efforts  ensuring guest satisfaction and providing outstanding customer service to both our customers and guests staying at hotels in our system 
we enter into agreements to franchise our lodging brands to independent hotel owners 
our standard franchise agreement typically has a term of to years and provides a franchisee with certain rights to terminate the franchise agreement before the term of the agreement under certain circumstances 
the principal source of revenues from franchising hotels is ongoing franchise fees  which are comprised of royalty fees and other fees relating to marketing and reservation services 
ongoing franchise fees typically are based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchised hotel and are recorded upon becoming due from the franchisee 
an estimate of uncollectible ongoing franchise fees is charged to bad debt expense and included in operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
lodging revenues also include initial franchise fees  which are recognized as revenues when all material services or conditions have been substantially performed  which is either when a 
table of contents franchised hotel opens for business or when a franchise agreement is terminated after it has been determined that the franchised hotel will not open

management fee revenues are recorded as a component of franchise fee revenues and reimbursable revenues are recorded as a component of service fees and membership revenues on the consolidated statements of operations 
the costs  which principally relate to payroll costs for operational employees who work at the managed hotels  are reflected as a component of operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
the reimbursements from hotel owners are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin  as a result  these reimbursable costs have little to no effect on our operating income 
management fee revenues and revenues related to payroll reimbursements were million and million  respectively  during  million and million  respectively  during and million and million  respectively  during we also earn revenues from administering the wyndham rewards loyalty program 
we charge our franchisee managed hotel owner a fee based upon a percentage of room revenues generated from member stays at participating hotels 
this fee is recorded upon becoming due from the franchisee 
within our lodging segment  we measure operating performance using the following key operating statistics i number of rooms  which represents the number of rooms at lodging properties at the end of the year and ii revenue per available room revpar  which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of available rooms occupied during the year by the average rate charged for renting a lodging room for one day 
vacation exchange and rentals as a provider of vacation exchange services  we enter into affiliation agreements with developers of vacation ownership properties to allow owners of intervals to trade their intervals for certain other intervals within our vacation exchange business and  for some members  for other leisure related products and services 
additionally  as a marketer of vacation rental properties  generally we enter into contracts for exclusive periods of time with property owners to market the rental of such properties to rental customers 
our vacation exchange business derives a majority of its revenues from annual membership dues and exchange fees from members trading their intervals 
annual dues revenues represents the annual membership fees from members who participate in our vacation exchange business and  for additional fees  have the right to exchange their intervals for certain other intervals within our vacation exchange business and  for certain members  for other leisure related products and services 
we recognize revenues from annual membership dues on a straight line basis over the membership period during which delivery of publications  if applicable  and other services are provided to the members 
exchange fees are generated when members exchange their intervals for equivalent values of rights and services  which may include intervals at other properties within our vacation exchange business or other leisure related products and services 
exchange fees are recognized as revenues  net of expected cancellations  when the exchange requests have been confirmed to the member 
our vacation rentals business primarily derives its revenues from fees  which generally average between and of the gross booking fees for non proprietary inventory  except for where we receive of the revenues for properties that we own or operate under long term capital leases 
the majority of the time  we act on behalf of the owners of the rental properties to generate our fees 
we provide reservation services to the independent 
table of contents property owners and receive the agreed upon fee for the service provided 
we remit the gross rental fee received from the renter to the independent property owner  net of our agreed upon fee 
revenues from such fees are recognized in the period that the rental reservation is made  net of expected cancellations 
cancellations for  and each totaled less than of rental transactions booked 
upon confirmation of the rental reservation  the rental customer and property owner generally have a direct relationship for additional services to be performed

vacation ownership we develop  market and sell vois to individual consumers  provide property management services at resorts and provide consumer financing in connection with the sale of vois 
our vacation ownership business derives the majority of its revenues from sales of vois and derives other revenues from consumer financing and property management 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or seller financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues from voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting described in the guidance for sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for non delivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues from voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
in accordance with the guidance for accounting for real estate time sharing transactions  we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenues and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
we also offer consumer financing as an option to customers purchasing vois  which are typically collateralized by the underlying voi 
the contractual terms of seller provided financing agreements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 
an estimate of uncollectible amounts is recorded at the time of the sale with a charge to the provision for loan losses  which is classified as a reduction of vacation ownership interest sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
the interest income earned from the financing arrangements is earned on the principal balance outstanding over the life of the arrangement and is recorded within consumer financing on the consolidated statements of operations 
we also provide day to day management services  including oversight of housekeeping services  maintenance and certain accounting and administrative services for property owners associations and clubs 
in some cases  our employees serve as officers and or directors of these associations and clubs in accordance with their by laws and associated regulations 
management fee revenues are recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the 
table of contents contract and is recorded as a component of service fees and membership on the consolidated statements of operations 
the costs  which principally relate to the payroll costs for management of the associations  clubs and the resort properties where we are the employer  are reflected as a component of operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
reimbursements are based upon the costs incurred with no added margin and thus presentation of these reimbursable costs has little to no effect on our operating income 
management fee revenues and revenues related to reimbursements were million and million  respectively  during  million and million  respectively  during and million and million  respectively  during during  and  one of the associations that we manage paid wyndham exchange and rentals million  million and million  respectively  for exchange services 
during  and  gross sales of vois were increased by million and reduced by million and million  respectively  representing the net change in revenues that was deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  a portion of the total revenues from a vacation ownership contract sale is not recognized if the construction of the vacation resort has not yet been fully completed 
such deferred revenues were recognized in subsequent periods in proportion to the costs incurred as compared to the total expected costs for completion of construction of the vacation resort 
as of december   all revenues that were previously deferred under the percentage of completion method of accounting had been recognized 
within our vacation ownership segment  we measure operating performance using the following key metrics i gross voi sales including tele sales upgrades  which are a component of upgrade sales before deferred sales and loan loss provisions  ii tours  which represents the number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell vois  and iii volume per guest  or vpg  which represents revenue per guest and is calculated by dividing the gross voi sales  excluding tele sales upgrades  which are a component of upgrade sales  by the number of tours 
other items we record lodging related marketing and reservation revenues  wyndham rewards revenues  as well as hotel property management services revenues for both our lodging and vacation ownership segments  in accordance with guidance for reporting revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues be recorded on a gross basis 
discussed below are our consolidated results of operations and the results of operations for each of our reportable segments 
the reportable segments presented below represent our operating segments for which separate financial information is available and which is utilized on a regular basis by our chief operating decision maker to assess performance and to allocate resources 
in identifying our reportable segments  we also consider the nature of services provided by our operating segments 
management evaluates the operating results of each of our reportable segments based upon revenues and ebitda  which is defined as net income loss before depreciation and amortization  interest expense excluding consumer financing interest  interest income excluding consumer financing interest and income taxes  each of which is presented on the consolidated statements of operations 
we believe that ebitda is a useful measure of performance for our industry segments which  when considered with gaap measures  gives a more complete understanding of our operating performance 
our presentation of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

table of contents the revpar decline was driven by industry wide occupancy and rate declines 
the million of lower reimbursable revenues earned by our property management business primarily relates to payroll costs that we incur and pay on behalf of hotel owners  for which we are entitled to be fully reimbursed by the hotel owner 
as the reimbursements are made based upon cost with no added margin  the recorded revenues are offset by the associated expense and there is no resultant impact on ebitda 
such amount decreased as a result of a reduction in costs at our managed properties due to lower occupancy  as well as a reduction in the number of hotels under management

ebitda further reflects favorability resulting from the absence of million of charges recorded during the fourth quarter of  million in cost savings from overhead reductions and benefits related to organizational realignment initiatives and million of lower volume related expenses  partially offset by million of losses from foreign exchange transactions and the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange hedging contracts 
net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services decreased million during compared to excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange movements  net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million during as rental transaction volume increased primarily driven by increased volume at i our landal business  which benefited from enhanced marketing programs  and ii our uk cottage business due to successful marketing and promotional offers as well as increased functionality of its new web platform 
such favorability was partially offset by lower member rentals  which we believe was a result of members reducing the number of extra vacations primarily due to the downturn in the economy 
average net price per rental increased primarily resulting from a change in the mix of various rental offerings  with favorable impacts by our landal greenparks and uk cottage businesses  partially offset by an unfavorable impact at our novasol and member rental businesses

the decrease in revenue per member was due to lower exchange transactions and subscription fees  partially offset by the impact of higher exchange transaction pricing 
we believe that the lower revenue per member reflects i the economic uncertainty  ii lower subscription fees due primarily to member retention programs offered at multiyear discounts and iii recent trends among timeshare vacation ownership developers to enroll members in private label clubs  whereby the members have the option to exchange within the club or through rci channels 
such trends have a positive impact on the average number of members but an offsetting effect on the number of exchange transactions per member

such net revenues increase was more than offset in ebitda by increased expenses  particularly associated with a strategic change in direction related to our howard johnson brand  ancillary services provided to franchisees  incremental hotel management reimbursable revenues  the acquisition of usfs and organizational realignment initiatives  partially offset by savings from cost containment initiatives 
the acquisition of usfs contributed incremental net revenues and ebitda of million and million  respectively 
apart from this acquisition  the increase in net revenues includes million of incremental international royalty  marketing and reservation revenues resulting from international revpar growth of  or excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements  and a increase in international rooms  million of incremental revenues generated by our wyndham rewards loyalty program primarily due to increased member stays  million of incremental reimbursable revenues earned by our hotel management business  and a million increase in other revenues primarily due to fees generated upon execution of franchise contracts and ancillary services that we provide to our franchisees 
such increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in domestic royalty  marketing and reservation revenues due to a domestic revpar decline of and incremental development advance note amortization  which is recorded net within revenues 
the domestic revpar decline was principally driven by an overall decline in industry occupancy levels  while the international revpar growth was principally driven by price increases  partially offset by a decline in occupancy levels 
the million of incremental reimbursable revenues earned by our hotel management business primarily relates to payroll costs that we incur and pay on behalf of hotel owners  for which we are fully reimbursed by the hotel owner 
as the reimbursements are made based upon cost with no added margin  the recorded revenues are offset by the associated expense and there is no resultant impact on ebitda

net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million during compared to excluding the favorable impact of foreign exchange movements  net revenues generated from rental transactions and related services increased million during driven by i the conversion of two of our landal parks from franchised to managed  which contributed an incremental million to revenues  and ii a increase in the average net price per rental primarily resulting from increased pricing at our landal and novasol european vacation rentals businesses 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in rental transaction volume primarily driven by lower rental volume at our other european cottage businesses as well as lower member rentals  which we believe was a result of customers altering their vacation decisions primarily due to the downturn in north america and other worldwide economies 
the decline in rental transaction volume was partially offset by increased rentals at our landal business  which benefited from enhanced marketing programs 
annual dues and exchange revenues decreased million during compared to excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange movements  annual dues and exchange revenues declined million driven by a decline in revenue generated per member  partially offset by a increase in the average number of members 
the decrease in revenue per member was driven by lower exchange transactions per member  partially offset by the impact of favorable exchange transaction pricing driven by transaction mix 
we believe that lower transactions reflect i recent heightened economic uncertainty and ii recent trends among timeshare vacation ownership developers to enroll members in private label clubs  whereby the members have the option to exchange within the club or through rci channels 
such trends have a positive impact on the average number of members but an offsetting effect on the number of exchange transactions per average member 
an increase in ancillary revenues of million was driven by i the million asia pacific adjustment  as discussed above  and ii million from various sources  which include fees from additional services provided to transacting members  club servicing revenues  fees from our credit card loyalty program and fees generated from programs with affiliated resorts  partially offset by million due to the unfavorable translation effects of foreign exchange movements

such increases were partially offset by million of favorable hedging on foreign exchange contracts  million in cost savings from overhead reductions  the absence of million of severance related expenses recorded during  and million of lower marketing expenses primarily due to timing 
vacation ownership net revenues and ebitda decreased million and  million  respectively  during compared to during october  we announced plans to refocus our vacation ownership sales and marketing efforts on consumers with higher credit quality beginning in the fourth quarter of as a result  operating results reflect costs related to realignment initiatives and decreased gross voi sales 
results also reflect a higher provision for loan losses  partially offset by growth in consumer finance income  as well as lower cost of sales and decreased employee related expenses 
during december  we announced an acceleration of our initiatives to increase cash flow and reduce our need to access the asset backed securities market by reducing the sales pace of our vacation ownership business 
we expect gross sales of vois during of approximately billion a decrease of approximately from 
in addition  management performed its annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with the guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets during the fourth quarter of we used a discounted cash flow model and incorporated assumptions that we believe marketplace participants would utilize 
management concluded that an adjustment was appropriate and  as such  during  we recorded a non cash  million charge for the impairment of goodwill at our vacation ownership business to reflect reduced future cash flow estimates based on the expectation that access to the asset backed securities market will continue to be challenging 
gross sales of vois at our vacation ownership business decreased million during compared to  as tour flow and vpg remained relatively unchanged 
an increase in upgrades was more than offset by a decrease in sales to new customers 
the positive impact to tour flow from the continued growth of our in house sales programs  albeit slower than during due to the impact of negative economic conditions faced during  was offset by the closure of over sales offices 
the positive impact to vpg from a favorable tour mix and higher pricing was offset by a decrease in sales to new customers 
we believe that the positive impact to upgrades resulted from increased pricing  a larger owner base  new resorts and more units 
net revenues were favorably impacted by million of incremental property management fees primarily as a result of growth in the number of units under management 
such revenues increase was more than offset by i an increase of million in our provision for loan losses during as compared to primarily due to a higher estimate of uncollectible receivables as a percentage of voi sales financed and ii a million decrease in ancillary revenues associated with bonus points credits that are provided as purchase incentives on voi sales 
the trend of higher uncollectible receivables as a percentage of voi sales financed has continued since the fourth quarter of as the strains of the overall economy appear to be negatively impacting the borrowers in our portfolio  particularly those with lower credit scores 
while the continued impact of the economy is uncertain  we have taken measures that  over time  should leave us with a smaller portfolio that has a stronger credit profile

we currently have million remaining availability in our program  which includes proceeds received from stock option exercises 
such repurchase capacity will continue to be increased by proceeds received from future stock option exercises 
the amount and timing of specific repurchases are subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements and other factors 
repurchases may be conducted in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
contingent tax liabilities the rules governing taxation are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
therefore  our tax accruals reflect a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions 
while we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our tax accruals are reasonable  tax audits and any related litigation could result in tax liabilities for us that are materially different than those reflected in our historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
the result of an audit or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision  net income  and or cash flows in the period or periods to which such audit or litigation relates 
the irs has commenced an audit of cendant s taxable years through  during which we were included in cendant s tax returns 
our recorded tax liabilities in respect of such taxable years represent our current best estimates of the probable outcome with respect to certain tax provisions taken by cendant for which we would be responsible under the tax sharing agreement 
we believe that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  however  the outcome of the tax audits is inherently uncertain 
there can be no assurance that the irs will not propose adjustments to the returns for which we would be responsible under the tax sharing agreement or that any such proposed adjustments would not be material 
any determination by the irs or a court that imposed tax liabilities on us under the tax sharing agreement in excess of our tax accruals could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision  net income  and or cash flows  which is the result of our obligations under the separation and distribution agreement  as discussed in note separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries 
the irs examination is progressing and we currently expect that the irs examination may be completed during the second or third quarter of as part of the anticipated completion of the pending irs examination  we are working with the irs through other former cendant companies to resolve outstanding audit and tax sharing issues 
at present  we believe the recorded liabilities are adequate to address 
table of contents claims  though there can be no assurance of such an outcome with the irs or the former cendant companies until the conclusion of the process 
a failure to so resolve this examination and related tax sharing issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
as of december   we had million of tax liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement  which are recorded within due to former parent and subsidiaries on the consolidated balance sheet

vacation ownership contract receivables and securitizations we pool qualifying vacation ownership contract receivables and sell them to bankruptcy remote entities 
vacation ownership contract receivables qualify for securitization based primarily on the credit strength of the voi purchaser to whom financing has been extended 
vacation ownership contract receivables are securitized through bankruptcy remote spes that are consolidated within our consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we do not recognize gains or losses resulting from these securitizations at the time of sale to the spes 
income is recognized when earned over the contractual life of the vacation ownership contract receivables 
we continue to service the securitized vacation ownership contract receivables pursuant to servicing agreements negotiated on an arms length basis based on market conditions 
the activities of these spes are limited to i purchasing vacation ownership contract receivables from our vacation ownership subsidiaries  ii issuing debt securities and or borrowing under a conduit facility to fund such purchases  and iii entering into derivatives to hedge interest rate exposure 
the securitized assets of these bankruptcy remote spes are not available to pay our general obligations

covenants the revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan are subject to covenants including the maintenance of specific financial ratios 
the financial ratio covenants consist of a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least to as of the measurement date and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed to on the measurement date 
the consolidated interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement by consolidated interest expense as defined in the credit agreement  both as measured on a trailing month basis preceding the measurement date 
as of december   our interest coverage ratio was times 
consolidated interest expense excludes  among other things  interest expense on any securitization indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement 
the consolidated leverage ratio is calculated by dividing consolidated total indebtedness as defined in the credit agreement and which excludes  among other things  securitization indebtedness as of the measurement date by consolidated ebitda as measured on a trailing month basis preceding the measurement date 
as of december   our leverage ratio was times 
covenants in these credit facilities also include limitations on indebtedness of material subsidiaries  liens  mergers  consolidations  liquidations and dissolutions  sale of all or substantially all assets  and sale and leaseback transactions 
events of default in these credit facilities include failure to pay interest  principal and fees when due  breach of covenants  acceleration of or failure to pay other debt in excess of million excluding securitization indebtedness  insolvency matters  and a change of control 
the senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured notes contain various covenants including limitations on liens  limitations on potential sale and leaseback transactions and change of control restrictions 
in addition  there are limitations on mergers  consolidations and potential sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
events of default in the notes include failure to pay interest and principal when due  breach of a covenant or warranty  acceleration of other debt in excess of million and insolvency matters 
the convertible notes do not contain affirmative or negative covenants  however  the limitations on mergers  consolidations and potential sale of all or substantially all of our assets and the events of default for our senior unsecured notes are applicable to such notes 
holders of the convertible notes have the right to require us to repurchase the convertible notes at of principal plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of a fundamental change  defined to include  among other things  a change of control  certain recapitalizations and if our common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange 
the vacation ownership secured bank facility contains covenants including a consumer loan coverage ratio that requires that the aggregate principal amount of consumer loans that are current on payments must exceed of the aggregate principal amount of all consumer loans in the applicable loan portfolio 
if the aggregate principal amount of current consumer loans falls below this threshold  we must pay the bank syndicate cash to cover the shortfall 
this ratio is also used to set the advance rate under the facility 
the facility contains other typical restrictions and covenants including limitations on mergers  partnerships and certain asset sales 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants described above including the required financial ratios 
each of our securitized term notes and the bank conduit facility contains various triggers relating to the performance of the applicable loan pools 
if the vacation ownership contract receivables pool that collateralizes one of our securitization notes fails to perform within the parameters established by the contractual triggers such as higher default or delinquency rates  there are provisions pursuant to which the cash flows for that pool will be maintained in the securitization as extra collateral for the note holders or applied to amortize the outstanding principal held by the noteholders 
as of december   all of our securitized pools were in compliance with applicable triggers 

table of contents liquidity risk our vacation ownership business finances certain of its receivables through i an asset backed bank conduit facility and ii periodically accessing the capital markets by issuing asset backed securities 
none of the currently outstanding asset backed securities contains any recourse provisions to us other than interest rate risk related to swap counterparties solely to the extent that the amount outstanding on our notes differs from the forecasted amortization schedule at the time of issuance 
throughout and most of  the asset backed securities market in the united states suffered adverse market conditions 
during  access to the term securitization market began to improve  as demonstrated by the closing of five term securitization transactions  which are discussed in further detail in note long term debt and borrowing arrangements 
as a result of adverse market conditions  during and  our cost of securitized borrowings increased due to increased spreads over relevant benchmarks 
as planned  our vacation ownership business reduced its sales pace of vois from billion during to billion during accordingly  we believe that the bank conduit facility  with a term through october and capacity of million  should provide sufficient liquidity for the lower expected sales pace and we expect to have available liquidity to finance the sale of vois 
the outstanding balance on our previous bank conduit facility was repaid on october  our wyndham vacation resorts asia pacific pty ltd 
operations are funded by a day secured  revolving foreign credit facility with a total capacity of aud million 
we closed on a facility with capacity of aud million during june and an additional bank joined the facility during july  increasing the capacity to aud million see note long term debt and borrowing arrangements 
this facility had a total of million outstanding as of december  and is secured by vacation ownership contract receivables  as well as a standard wyndham worldwide corporation guaranty 
some of our vacation ownership developments are supported by surety bonds provided by affiliates of certain insurance companies in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states 
in the ordinary course of our business  we have assembled commitments from thirteen surety providers in the amount of billion  of which we had million outstanding as of december  the availability  terms and conditions  and pricing of such bonding capacity is dependent on  among other things  continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing such bonding capacity  the general availability of such capacity and our corporate credit rating 
if such bonding capacity is unavailable or  alternatively  if the terms and conditions and pricing of such bonding capacity are unacceptable to us  the cost of development of our vacation ownership units could be negatively impacted 
our liquidity position may also be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in the capital markets in which we operate or if our vacation ownership contract receivables portfolios do not meet specified portfolio credit parameters 
our liquidity as it relates to our vacation ownership contract receivables securitization program could be adversely affected if we were to fail to renew or replace our conduit facility on its annual expiration date or if a particular receivables pool were to fail to meet certain ratios  which could occur in certain instances if the default rates or other credit metrics of the underlying vacation ownership contract receivables deteriorate 
our ability to sell securities backed by our vacation ownership contract receivables depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities 
as of december   we had million of availability under our asset backed bank conduit facility 
to the extent that the recent increases in funding costs in the securitization and commercial paper markets persist  they will negatively impact the cost of such borrowings 
a continued disruption to the asset backed or commercial paper markets could adversely impact our ability to obtain such financings 
our senior unsecured debt is rated bbb by standard and poor s s p 
during february  s p assigned a stable outlook to our senior unsecured debt 
during april  moody s investors service moody s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to ba and our corporate family rating to ba with a stable outlook 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and is subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization 
currently  we expect no i material increase in interest expense and or ii material reduction in the availability of bonding capacity from the aforementioned downgrade or negative outlook  however  a further downgrade by moody s and or s p could impact our future borrowing and or bonding costs and availability of such bonding capacity 
as a result of the sale of realogy on april   realogy s senior debt credit rating was downgraded to below investment grade 
under the separation agreement  if realogy experienced such a change of control and suffered such a ratings downgrade  it was required to post a letter of credit in an amount acceptable to us and avis budget group to satisfy the fair value of realogy s indemnification obligations for the cendant legacy contingent liabilities in the event realogy does not otherwise satisfy such obligations to the extent they become due 
on 
table of contents april   realogy posted a million irrevocable standby letter of credit from a major commercial bank in favor of avis budget group and upon which demand may be made if realogy does not otherwise satisfy its obligations for its share of the cendant legacy contingent liabilities 
the letter of credit can be adjusted from time to time based upon the outstanding contingent liabilities and has an expiration date of september  subject to renewal and certain provisions 
as such  on august   the letter of credit was reduced to million 
the issuance of this letter of credit does not relieve or limit realogy s obligations for these liabilities 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net revenues and net income from our franchise and management fees  commission income earned from renting vacation properties  annual subscription fees or annual membership dues  as applicable  and exchange transaction fees and sales of vois 
revenues from franchise and management fees are generally higher in the second and third quarters than in the first or fourth quarters  because of increased leisure travel during the summer months 
revenues from rental income earned from vacation rentals are generally highest in the third quarter  when vacation rentals are highest 
revenues from vacation exchange transaction fees are generally highest in the first quarter  which is generally when members of our vacation exchange business plan and book their vacations for the year 
historically  revenues from sales of vois were generally higher in the second and third quarters than in other quarters 
we expect such trend to continue during however  during  as the economy continued to stabilize  revenues from sales of vois were highest during the third and fourth quarters 
the seasonality of our business may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
as we expand into new markets and geographical locations  we may experience increased or different seasonality dynamics that create fluctuations in operating results different from the fluctuations we have experienced in the past 
separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries transfer of cendant corporate liabilities and issuance of guarantees to cendant and affiliates pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement  upon the distribution of our common stock to cendant shareholders  we entered into certain guarantee commitments with cendant pursuant to the assumption of certain liabilities and the obligation to indemnify cendant  realogy and travelport for such liabilities and guarantee commitments related to deferred compensation arrangements with each of cendant and realogy 
these guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities  contingent tax liabilities  and cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities  of which we assumed and are responsible for  while realogy is responsible for the remaining 
the amount of liabilities which we assumed in connection with the separation was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these amounts were comprised of certain cendant corporate liabilities which were recorded on the books of cendant as well as additional liabilities which were established for guarantees issued at the date of separation related to certain unresolved contingent matters and certain others that could arise during the guarantee period 
regarding the guarantees  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability  we would be responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
we also provided a default guarantee related to certain deferred compensation arrangements related to certain current and former senior officers and directors of cendant  realogy and travelport 
these arrangements  which are discussed in more detail below  have been valued upon the separation in accordance with the guidance for guarantees and recorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent such recorded liabilities are not adequate to cover the ultimate payment amounts  such excess will be reflected as an expense to the results of operations in future periods 
the million of separation related liabilities is comprised of million for litigation matters  million for tax liabilities  million for liabilities of previously sold businesses of cendant  million for other contingent and corporate liabilities and million of liabilities where the calculated guarantee amount exceeded the contingent liability assumed at the date of separation 
in connection with these liabilities  million is recorded in current due to former parent and subsidiaries and million is recorded in long term due to former parent and subsidiaries as of december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
we are indemnifying cendant for these contingent liabilities and therefore any payments would be made to the third party through the former parent 
the million relating to guarantees is recorded in other current liabilities as of december  on the consolidated balance sheet 
the actual timing of payments relating to these liabilities is dependent on a variety of factors beyond our control 
see contractual obligations for the estimated timing of such payments 
in addition  as of december   we have million of receivables due from former parent and subsidiaries primarily relating to income taxes  which is recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
such receivables totaled million as of december  
table of contents following is a discussion of the liabilities on which we issued guarantees contingent litigation liabilities we assumed of liabilities for certain litigation relating to  arising out of or resulting from certain lawsuits in which cendant is named as the defendant 
the indemnification obligation will continue until the underlying lawsuits are resolved 
we will indemnify cendant to the extent that cendant is required to make payments related to any of the underlying lawsuits 
as the indemnification obligation relates to matters in various stages of litigation  the maximum exposure cannot be quantified 
due to the inherently uncertain nature of the litigation process  the timing of payments related to these liabilities cannot reasonably be predicted  but is expected to occur over several years 
since the separation  cendant settled a majority of these lawsuits and we assumed a portion of the related indemnification obligations 
for each settlement  we paid of the aggregate settlement amount to cendant 
our payment obligations under the settlements were greater or less than our accruals  depending on the matter 
on september   cendant received an adverse ruling in a litigation matter for which we retained a indemnification obligation 
the judgment on the adverse ruling was entered on may  on may   cendant filed an appeal of the judgment and  on july   an order was entered denying the appeal 
as a result of the denial of the appeal  realogy and we determined to pay the judgment 
on july   we paid our portion of the aforementioned judgment million 
although the judgment for the underlying liability for this matter has been paid  the phase of the litigation involving the determination of fees owed the plaintiffs attorneys remains pending 
similar to the contingent liability  we are responsible for of any attorneys fees payable 
as a result of settlements and payments to cendant  as well as other reductions and accruals for developments in active litigation matters  our aggregate accrual for outstanding cendant contingent litigation liabilities was million as of december  contingent tax liabilities prior to the separation  we were included in the consolidated federal and state income tax returns of cendant through the separation date for the period then ended 
we are generally liable for of certain contingent tax liabilities 
in addition  each of us  cendant and realogy may be responsible for of certain of cendant s tax liabilities that will provide the responsible party with a future  offsetting tax benefit 
we will pay to cendant the amount of taxes allocated pursuant to the tax sharing agreement  as amended during the third quarter of  for the payment of certain taxes 
as a result of the amendment to the tax sharing agreement  we recorded a gross up of our contingent tax liability and have a corresponding deferred tax asset of million as of december  during the first quarter of  the irs opened an examination for cendant s taxable years through during which we were included in cendant s tax returns 
as of december   our accrual for outstanding cendant contingent tax liabilities was million 
this liability will remain outstanding until tax audits related to taxable years through are completed or the statutes of limitations governing such tax years have passed 
balances due to cendant for these pre separation tax returns and related tax attributes were estimated as of december  and have since been adjusted in connection with the filing of the pre separation tax returns 
these balances will again be adjusted after the ultimate settlement of the related tax audits of these periods 
we believe that the accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter  however  the outcome of the tax audits is inherently uncertain 
such tax audits and any related litigation  including disputes or litigation on the allocation of tax liabilities between parties under the tax sharing agreement  could result in outcomes for us that are different from those reflected in our historical financial statements 
the irs examination is progressing and we currently expect that the irs examination may be completed during the second or third quarter of as part of the anticipated completion of the pending irs examination  we are working with the irs through other former cendant companies to resolve outstanding audit and tax sharing issues 
at present  we believe that the recorded liabilities are adequate to address claims  though there can be no assurance of such an outcome with the irs or the former cendant companies until the conclusion of the process 
a failure to so resolve this examination and related tax sharing issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities we have assumed of corporate liabilities of cendant including liabilities relating to i cendant s terminated or divested businesses  ii liabilities relating to the travelport sale  if any  and iii generally any actions with respect to the separation plan or the distributions brought by any third party 
our maximum exposure to loss cannot be quantified as this guarantee relates primarily to future claims that may be made against cendant 
we assessed the probability and amount of potential liability related to this guarantee based on the extent and nature of historical experience 

table of contents guarantee related to deferred compensation arrangements in the event that cendant  realogy and or travelport are not able to meet certain deferred compensation obligations under specified plans for certain current and former officers and directors because of bankruptcy or insolvency  we have guaranteed such obligations to the extent relating to amounts deferred in respect of and earlier 
this guarantee will remain outstanding until such deferred compensation balances are distributed to the respective officers and directors 
the maximum exposure cannot be quantified as the guarantee  in part  is related to the value of deferred investments as of the date of the requested distribution

d excludes million of our liability for unrecognized tax benefits associated with the guidance for uncertainty in income taxes since it is not reasonably estimatable to determine the periods in which such liability would be settled with the respective tax authorities 
in addition to the above and in connection with our separation from cendant  we entered into certain guarantee commitments with cendant pursuant to our assumption of certain liabilities and our obligation to indemnify cendant  realogy and travelport for such liabilities and guarantee commitments related to deferred compensation arrangements with each of cendant and realogy 
these guarantee arrangements primarily relate to certain contingent litigation liabilities  contingent tax liabilities  and cendant contingent and other corporate liabilities  of which we assumed and are responsible for of these cendant liabilities 
additionally  if any of the companies responsible for all or a portion of such liabilities were to default in its payment of costs or expenses related to any such liability  we are responsible for a portion of the defaulting party or parties obligation 
we also provide a default guarantee related to certain deferred compensation arrangements related to certain current and former senior officers and directors of cendant and realogy 
these arrangements were valued upon our separation from cendant with the assistance of third party experts in accordance with guidance for guarantees and recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet 
to the extent such recorded liabilities are not adequate to cover the ultimate payment amounts  such excess will be reflected as an expense to our results of operations in future periods 
see separation adjustments and transactions with former parent and subsidiaries discussion for details of guaranteed liabilities 

table of contents other commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements purchase commitments 
in the normal course of business  we make various commitments to purchase goods or services from specific suppliers  including those related to vacation ownership resort development and other capital expenditures 
purchase commitments made by us as of december  aggregated million 
individually  such commitments range as high as million related to the development of a vacation ownership resort 
the majority of the commitments relate to the development of vacation ownership properties aggregating million  million of which relates to and million of which relates to 
standard guarantees indemnifications 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements that contain standard guarantees and indemnities whereby we indemnify another party for specified breaches of or third party claims relating to an underlying agreement 
such underlying agreements are typically entered into by one of our subsidiaries 
the various underlying agreements generally govern purchases  sales or outsourcing of assets or businesses  leases of real estate  licensing of trademarks  development of vacation ownership properties  access to credit facilities  derivatives and issuances of debt securities 
while a majority of these guarantees and indemnifications extend only for the duration of the underlying agreement  some survive the expiration of the agreement 
we are not able to estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees and indemnifications as the triggering events are not predictable 
in certain cases we maintain insurance coverage that may mitigate any potential payments 
other guarantees indemnifications 
in the ordinary course of business  our vacation ownership business provides guarantees to certain owners associations for funds required to operate and maintain vacation ownership properties in excess of assessments collected from owners of the vois 
we may be required to fund such excess as a result of unsold company owned vois or failure by owners to pay such assessments 
these guarantees extend for the duration of the underlying subsidy or similar agreement which generally approximate one year and are renewable at our discretion on an annual basis or until a stipulated percentage typically or higher of related vois are sold 
the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under these guarantees was approximately million as of december  we would only be required to pay this maximum amount if none of the owners assessed paid their assessments 
any assessments collected from the owners of the vois would reduce the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made by us 
additionally  should we be required to fund the deficit through the payment of any owners assessments under these guarantees  we would be permitted access to the property for our own use and may use that property to engage in revenue producing activities  such as rentals 
during  and  we made payments related to these guarantees of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we maintained a liability in connection with these guarantees of million and million  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
from time to time  we may enter into a hotel management agreement that provides the hotel owner with a minimum return 
under such agreement  we would be required to compensate for any shortfall over the life of the management agreement up to a specified aggregate amount 
our exposure under these guarantees is partially mitigated by our ability to terminate any such management agreement if certain targeted operating results are not met 
additionally  we are able to recapture a portion or all of the shortfall payments and any waived fees in the event that future operating results exceed targets 
as of december   the maximum potential amount of future payments to be made under these guarantees is million with an annual cap of million or less 
as of both december  and  we maintained a liability in connection with these guarantees of less than million on our consolidated balance sheets 
securitizations 
we pool qualifying vacation ownership contract receivables and sell them to bankruptcy remote entities all of which are consolidated into the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  letters of credit 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of irrevocable standby letters of credit outstanding  which mainly support development activity at our vacation ownership business 
critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it could result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and 
table of contents complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
vacation ownership revenue recognition 
our sales of vois are either cash sales or seller financed sales 
in order for us to recognize revenues of voi sales under the full accrual method of accounting described in the guidance for sales of real estate for fully constructed inventory  a binding sales contract must have been executed  the statutory rescission period must have expired after which time the purchasers are not entitled to a refund except for non delivery by us  receivables must have been deemed collectible and the remainder of our obligations must have been substantially completed 
in addition  before we recognize any revenues on voi sales  the purchaser of the voi must have met the initial investment criteria and  as applicable  the continuing investment criteria  by executing a legally binding financing contract 
a purchaser has met the initial investment criteria when a minimum down payment of is received by us 
in accordance with the requirements of the guidance for real estate time sharing transactions we must also take into consideration the fair value of certain incentives provided to the purchaser when assessing the adequacy of the purchaser s initial investment 
in those cases where financing is provided to the purchaser by us  the purchaser is obligated to remit monthly payments under financing contracts that represent the purchaser s continuing investment 
the contractual terms of seller provided financing arrangements require that the contractual level of annual principal payments be sufficient to amortize the loan over a customary period for the voi being financed  which is generally ten years  and payments under the financing contracts begin within days of the sale and receipt of the minimum down payment of 
if all of the criteria for a voi sale to qualify under the full accrual method of accounting have been met  as discussed above  except that construction of the voi purchased is not complete  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting provided that the preliminary construction phase is complete and that a minimum sales level has been met to assure that the property will not revert to a rental property 
the preliminary stage of development is deemed to be complete when the engineering and design work is complete  the construction contracts have been executed  the site has been cleared  prepared and excavated  and the building foundation is complete 
the completion percentage is determined by the proportion of real estate inventory costs incurred to total estimated costs 
these estimated costs are based upon historical experience and the related contractual terms 
the remaining revenues and related costs of sales  including commissions and direct expenses  are deferred and recognized as the remaining costs are incurred 
until a contract for sale qualifies for revenue recognition  all payments received are accounted for as restricted cash and deposits within other current assets and deferred income  respectively  on the consolidated balance sheets 
commissions and other direct costs related to the sale are deferred until the sale is recorded 
if a contract is cancelled before qualifying as a sale  non recoverable expenses are charged to the current period as part of operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
changes in costs could lead to adjustments to the percentage of completion status of a project  which may result in difference in the timing and amount of revenues recognized from the construction of vacation ownership properties 
this policy is discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses 
in our vacation ownership segment  we provide for estimated vacation ownership contract receivable cancellations at the time of voi sales by recording a provision for loan losses as a reduction of voi sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
we assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses based on the historical performance of similar vacation ownership contract receivables 
we use a technique referred to as static pool analysis  which tracks defaults for each year s sales over the entire life of those contract receivables 
we consider current defaults  past due aging  historical write offs of contracts  consumer credit scores fico scores in the assessment of borrower s credit strength and expected loan performance 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
if current conditions differ from the conditions in effect when the historical experience was generated  we adjust the allowance for loan losses to reflect the expected effects of the current environment on the collectability of our vacation ownership contract receivables 
impairment of long lived assets 
with regard to the goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets recorded in connection with business combinations  we annually during the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to completing our annual forecasting process or  more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  reviews the reporting units carrying values as required by the guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in the guidance 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of any reporting unit within the company that have recorded goodwill with the recorded net book value including the goodwill of the reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required 
if  however  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required  if any 
in this second step  the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit 
purchase business 
table of contents combination accounting rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared to the recorded amount of goodwill for the reporting unit  and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount  if lower 
in accordance with the guidance  we have determined that our reporting units are the same as our reportable segments 
quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  therefore  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units for purposes of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgments and estimates relating to future cash flows  including our interpretation of current economic indicators and market valuations  and assumptions about our strategic plans with regard to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises  market conditions change or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusion regarding whether existing goodwill is impaired could change and result in a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in performing our impairment analysis  we develop our estimated fair values for our reporting units using a combination of the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology establishes fair value by estimating the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated from the reporting unit 
the discount rate applied to the projected future cash flows to arrive at the present value is intended to reflect all risks of ownership and the associated risks of realizing the stream of projected future cash flows 
the discounted cash flow methodology uses our projections of financial performance for a five year period 
the most significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow methodology are the discount rate  the terminal value and expected future revenues  gross margins and operating margins  which vary among reporting units 
we use a market multiple methodology to estimate the terminal value of each reporting unit by comparing such reporting unit to other publicly traded companies that are similar from an operational and economic standpoint 
the market multiple methodology compares each reporting unit to the comparable companies on the basis of risk characteristics in order to determine the risk profile relative to the comparable companies as a group 
this analysis generally focuses on quantitative considerations  which include financial performance and other quantifiable data  and qualitative considerations  which include any factors which are expected to impact future financial performance 
the most significant assumption affecting our estimate of the terminal value of each reporting unit is the multiple of the enterprise value to earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization 
to support our estimate of the individual reporting unit fair values  a comparison is performed between the sum of the fair values of the reporting units and our market capitalization 
we use an average of our market capitalization over a reasonable period preceding the impairment testing date as being more reflective of our stock price trend than a single day  point in time market price 
the difference is an implied control premium  which represents the acknowledgment that the observed market prices of individual trades of a company s stock may not be representative of the fair value of the company as a whole 
estimates of a company s control premium are highly judgmental and depend on capital market and macro economic conditions overall 
we evaluate the implied control premium for reasonableness 
based on the results of our impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of  we determined that no impairment charge of goodwill was required as the fair value of goodwill at our lodging and vacation exchange and rentals reporting units was substantially in excess of the carrying value 
based on the results of our impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash  million charge for the impairment of goodwill at our vacation ownership reporting unit  where all of the goodwill previously recorded was determined to be impaired 
as of december  and  our accumulated goodwill impairment loss was  million  million  net of tax 
the aggregate carrying values of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets were  million and million  respectively  as of december  and  million and million  respectively  as of december  as of december   our goodwill is allocated between our lodging million and vacation exchange and rentals  million reporting units and other indefinite lived intangible assets are allocated between our lodging million and vacation exchange and rentals million reporting units 
we continue to monitor the goodwill recorded at our lodging and vacation exchange and rentals reporting units for indicators of impairment 
if economic conditions were to deteriorate more than expected  or other significant assumptions such as estimates of terminal value were to change significantly  we may be required to record an impairment of the goodwill balance at our lodging and vacation and exchange and rentals reporting units 
we also evaluate the recoverability of our other long lived assets  including property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred  pursuant to guidance for 
table of contents impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this analysis is performed by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  to be generated from such assets 
property and equipment is evaluated separately within each segment 
if such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable  the carrying value of such assets is reduced to fair value 
business combinations 
a component of our growth strategy has been to acquire and integrate businesses that complement our existing operations 
we account for business combinations in accordance with the guidance for business combinations and related literature 
accordingly  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of purchase 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  we use various recognized valuation methods including present value modeling and referenced market values where available 
further  we make assumptions within certain valuation techniques including discount rates and timing of future cash flows 
valuations are performed by management or independent valuation specialists under management s supervision  where appropriate 
we believe that the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions that marketplace participants would use 
however  such assumptions are inherently uncertain and actual results could differ from those estimates accounting for restructuring activities 
during  we committed to restructuring actions and activities associated with strategic realignment initiatives targeted principally at reducing costs  enhancing organizational efficiency  reducing our need to access the asset backed securities market and consolidating and rationalizing existing processes and facilities  which are accounted for under the guidance for post employment benefits and costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
our restructuring actions require us to make significant estimates in several areas including i expenses for severance and related benefit costs  ii the ability to generate sublease income  as well as our ability to terminate lease obligations  and iii contract terminations 
the amounts that we have accrued as of december  represent our best estimate of the obligations that we expect to incur in connection with these actions  but could be subject to change due to various factors including market conditions and the outcome of negotiations with third parties 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets to assess their potential realization and establish a valuation allowance for portions of such assets that we believe will not be ultimately realized 
in performing this review  we make estimates and assumptions regarding projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
a change in these assumptions could cause an increase or decrease to our valuation allowance resulting in an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate  which could materially impact our results of operations 
changes in accounting policies during  we adopted standards related to the following fair value measurements and disclosures determining fair value under market activity decline financial instruments we will adopt recently issued standards  related to the following  as required transfers and servicing consolidation multiple deliverable revenue arrangements for detailed information regarding these standards and the impact thereof on our financial statements  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts and interest rate caps to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related to our debt 
foreign currency forwards and options are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries and other transactions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed 
table of contents information about these financial instruments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
our primary interest rate exposure as of december  was to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically libor and asset backed commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
in addition  interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can impact us 
we anticipate that libor and asset backed commercial paper rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we have foreign currency rate exposure to exchange rate fluctuations worldwide and particularly with respect to the british pound and euro 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
we have approximately billion of debt outstanding as of december  of that total  million was issued as variable rate debt and has not been synthetically converted to fixed rate debt via an interest rate swap 
a hypothetical change in our effective weighted average interest rate would not generate a material change in interest expense 
the fair values of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate carrying values due to the short term nature of these assets 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of vacation ownership contract receivables 
the primary assumptions used in determining fair value are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates and discount rates 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt and interest rate derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of our foreign currency derivatives used by us to hedge underlying exposure that primarily consist of the non functional current assets and liabilities of us and our subsidiaries 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures as of december  the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are largely offset by the gains and losses on the underlying assets  liabilities or expected cash flows 
as of december   the absolute notional amount of our outstanding foreign exchange hedging instruments was million 
a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million in the fair value of the hedging instrument as of december  such a change would be largely offset by an opposite effect on the underlying assets  liabilities and expected cash flows 
our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december  market rates on outstanding financial instruments to perform the sensitivity analysis separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and foreign currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates
