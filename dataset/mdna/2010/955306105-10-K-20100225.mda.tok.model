item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
company overview west pharmaceutical services  inc which may be referred to as west  the company  we  us or our is a manufacturer of components and systems for injectable drug delivery and plastic packaging and delivery system components for the pharmaceutical  healthcare and consumer products industries 
the vast majority of our business is conducted in the pharmaceutical and healthcare markets 
our mission is to develop and apply proprietary technologies that improve the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic healthcare delivery systems 
during the years presented  our business was conducted through two segments pharmaceutical systems and tech group 
pharmaceutical systems focused on primary packaging and systems for injectable drug delivery  including stoppers and seals for vials  closures and other components used in syringe  intravenous and blood collection systems  prefillable syringe components  and safety and administration systems 
the tech group offered custom contract manufacturing solutions using plastic injection molding and manual and automated assembly processes targeted to the healthcare and consumer products industries 
as described in the recent developments section below  beginning in we realigned our business operations into two new segments 
our customer base includes the leading global producers and distributors of pharmaceuticals  biologics  medical devices and personal care products 
we have a global manufacturing footprint with production and distribution facilities in north america  europe  latin america  asia and australia 
west has also formed global partnerships to share technologies and market products with companies in japan and mexico 
as a result of our global manufacturing and distribution presence  more than half of our revenues are generated outside of the us in currencies other than the us dollar  including in europe and collectively in south america  asia and australia 
in terms of net sales and operating profit  the most significant foreign currencies are the euro  the british pound  the danish krone and the singapore dollar  with euro denominated sales representing the majority of sales transacted in foreign currencies 
for consolidated financial reporting purposes  transactions and balances reported in foreign currencies must be translated into us dollars based upon applicable foreign currency exchange rates 
financial performance highlights net sales were  million  marginally higher than the prior year s sales 
excluding impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the increase was million  or 
gross profit increased to million  slightly higher than  and our gross margin percentage was consistent with the prior year at 
excluding foreign exchange effects  gross profit increased million over the period 
operating profit for our reportable segments was million  a decrease of million compared with including corporate costs and other unallocated charges credits  operating profit for was million compared with million in the prior year 
net income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
at december  our total debt was million compared with million in the prior year and our net debt to total invested capital ratio was  an improvement of percentage points 
our financial position remains very strong  with net cash flow from operations totaling million in  compared to million in the prior year 
our board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from to per share beginning with the fourth quarter dividend 
we achieved higher sales and gross profit in  driven by the strong fourth quarter performance of our pharmaceutical systems segment 
despite the recessionary economic conditions and conservative ordering patterns from our customers  we were successful in growing revenues by managing pricing  improving sales mix and capitalizing on unique opportunities such as the hn influenza vaccination effort 
sales volumes were not a significant contributor to growth in as our customers searched for ways to cut costs including lowering inventories on hand and delaying discretionary development projects 
however  we grew revenue by converting customers to our higher value pharmaceutical packaging products that incorporate various post manufacturing  value added processes and advanced coatings that enhance quality  minimize defects and incorporate the most rigorous regulatory standards 
increased production levels in the fourth quarter contributed to improved plant utilization and we also saw a return to favorable raw material prices compared with the exceptionally high prices experienced in the second half of and the majority of the tech group was most affected by economic conditions during as certain customers withdrew from new product launches  reduced inventories on hand and curtailed purchases in line with lower consumer spending 
consolidated gross profit improved over the prior year as a result of increased demand in the fourth quarter and cost reduction efforts within both segments 
the effect of a significant increase in us pension costs  unfavorable foreign currency translation and higher general and administrative costs within our operating segments resulted in lower operating profit for the year 
overall  our pricing management  improved sales mix and manufacturing cost reduction initiatives combined with lower cash paid for taxes outweighed the increased general and administrative costs during  resulting in increased operating cash flows and a reduction in net debt 
recent developments acquisition on july   we acquired certain business assets of plastef investissements sa plastef and its subsidiaries  a france based developer and manufacturer of drug delivery devices 
plastef s products include the eris safety syringe system  which addresses the market for fixed needle prefilled syringes and complements our novaguard safety system  which employs the other common syringe format  luer lock syringes 
the acquired business assets included a manufacturing facility located at le vaudreuil  normandy  intellectual property and working capital 
the purchase price included cash paid at closing of million  funded from cash on hand  and contingent consideration with a fair value of million which is dependent upon the achievement of operating goals and other milestones over the next five years 
sales and operating results generated from the assets acquired from plastef are considered part of our tech group segment 
restructuring initiatives in december  we launched a restructuring plan for our tech group which addressed changes in customers marketing plans for certain products and aligned our plant capacity and workforce with the longer term strategy of focusing the business on proprietary products 
as part of this plan  we implemented a series of restructuring initiatives to reduce production and engineering operations  reduce administrative costs  and consolidate our tool shops into one location 
during the first half of  we incurred million in costs as we completed these restructuring activities 
during and  we incurred restructuring costs totaling million and million  respectively 
in the aggregate  costs of this program consisted of million in severance and benefits  million in impairments and other asset related charges  and million for contract termination fees and other expenses 
in november  we announced restructuring plans for certain business operations and support functions affecting both of our reporting segments 
the pharmaceutical systems plan involves exiting certain specialized laboratory service offerings due to a change in market demand  reducing support personnel primarily associated with information technology applications and discontinuing other non core initiatives and disposing of the associated assets 
the costs are estimated to be approximately million  which consists of million in cash expenditures related to employee severance benefits and million in asset impairment charges primarily related to removing certain laboratory equipment and plant assets from service 
annual savings from this portion of the plan are expected to be approximately million  including million in reduced depreciation expense 
the tech group plan is intended to better align our available production capacity with expected levels of contract manufacturing activity by consolidating manufacturing operations and support functions 
total costs of the tech group plan are estimated to be approximately million  which consists of million in cash expenditures for severance and asset relocation costs and million in accelerated depreciation due to the shortened useful life of the affected fixed assets 
this portion of the plan is expected to generate savings of approximately million in  increasing to approximately million annually following completion 
during  pharmaceutical systems incurred actual charges of million and tech group incurred charges of million  with the balance expected in as the respective activities are completed 
currency exchange rates fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant influence on our consolidated financial results 
in particular  changes in the euro exchange rate have the greatest potential to impact results as euro denominated sales accounted for of our consolidated sales and of all non us dollar denominated sales during  and a similar amount in the prior two years 
in general  our financial results are affected positively by a weaker us dollar and negatively by a stronger us dollar as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct our business 
during  on average  the us dollar appreciated against the euro and a combined against other key currencies  resulting in lower reported revenues of million and reduced operating profit of million versus the prior year 
for  our projections currently anticipate that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have a slightly favorable impact on consolidated sales and operating profit resulting from a depreciation of the us dollar relative to exchange rates 
us pension plan expense our expense for us pension and other post retirement benefits for was significantly higher than the prior year due primarily to the market decline in pension plan assets 
during  the slowing economy and adverse conditions in equity and debt markets contributed to a decline in the value of our us pension assets  compared to a long term rate of return assumption at the time of 
as a result of this and other changes in key actuarial assumptions  we experienced incremental expense of approximately million during versus as shown in the results of operations section below  us pension and other retirement plan expenses are considered a corporate cost and are not allocated to our reportable segments 
actual returns on our us pension plan assets during were significantly above our revised expected long term rate of return of  and we expect our expense to be lower than the amount 
business operations realignment effective january  our business operations have been realigned into two new management divisions  pharmaceutical packaging systems and pharmaceutical delivery systems in order to further align our business units with the underlying markets and customers they serve 
pharmaceutical packaging systems will consist of our core pharmaceutical packaging products  disposable medical components  and laboratory and other services 
pharmaceutical delivery systems will include safety and administration systems and multi component systems for drug administration  most of which were manufactured by our tech group segment 
in addition  the new pharmaceutical delivery systems segment will be responsible for the advancement of new delivery system products currently in development or early stage marketing 
the majority of the costs for these development and marketing activities were previously included in the pharmaceutical systems segment 
beginning with the first quarter of  this realignment will result in a change to our reportable segments  and our historical results will be restated accordingly to provide comparative financial information 
business outlook although we expect growth to continue to be hampered by a slow economic recovery  our business outlook for is positive as we anticipate customers will revert to normal ordering patterns and begin to move development programs ahead 
we expect full year revenues to grow moderately  driven by volume and mix improvement from our high value packaging product offerings  safety and administration systems and the launch of certain innovation products 
a smaller portion of our growth is expected to come from selling price increases which will serve to offset anticipated increases in raw materials and other production costs 
pension costs will remain at relative high levels as a consequence of the plan asset losses experienced during the market decline  although we expect some improvement from the expense 
we believe that the combination of higher revenues  a better mix of product sales and a lower cost structure  made possible by restructuring initiatives and aggressive lean savings initiatives at our production facilities  will provide for growth in operating profit during although there are a number of uncertainties that could impact our operating results  such as continued consolidation of the pharmaceuticals industry  the outcome of pending us healthcare legislation and continued recessionary pressures  we believe that the long term drivers remain strong and market dynamics support future growth with an aging population  continued advances in treatments for chronic illnesses and increased regulatory scrutiny 
given our positive growth outlook  we plan to continue funding the capital projects necessary to meet customer demand and to provide for improved results in our longer term strategic plan 
during the last two years  we made significant strides in increasing our plant capacity in germany  serbia  france  singapore and the us  and in we completed construction and commenced commercial production at our china plastic components facility 
during  we expect that our capital spending will be between million and million and that it will continue to be heavily weighted toward new products and expansion projects  as we plan to invest in a new rubber components facility in china  expand enhanced products capabilities in the us and europe  fund innovation projects and implement various global quality initiatives 
results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our operating results for the three years ended december   and our financial position as of december   should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes appearing in item of this report on form k 
for the purpose of aiding the comparison of our year to year results  reference is made in management s discussion and analysis to results excluding the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
constant currency amounts are calculated by translating the current year s functional currency results at the prior period s exchange rate 
those re measured period results on a constant currency basis are not in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and should not be used as a substitute for the related us gaap financial measures 
the us gaap financial measures are presented because management uses them in evaluating our results of operations and in comparing operating results to prior periods and believes that this information provides users a valuable insight into our results 
percentages in the following tables and throughout the results of operations section may reflect rounding adjustments 
net sales the following table summarizes net sales by reportable segment year ended december  change in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group intersegment sales total net sales compared to consolidated net sales increased marginally over those achieved in the prior year including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million 
excluding foreign currency translation effects  net sales increased million  or  from the prior year 
the increase was principally due to the favorable impact of annual selling price increases of percentage points  improved sales volume and mix of percentage points and percentage points resulting from our acquisition of plastef 
overall favorable sales results were attributable to pharmaceutical systems as the tech group sales were lower on unfavorable volume and mix and lower cost adjusted selling prices  as described below 
pharmaceutical systems this segment contributed million to the full year sales increase  despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of million 
excluding currency translation effects  sales were million  or  above prior year levels due mostly to higher selling prices and increased demand for our pharmaceutical packaging components 
sales of pharmaceutical packaging products excluding foreign currency changes during the year were million higher than the prior year due to higher sales of stoppers used in packaging for various drugs including the hn influenza vaccine and increased demand for prefilled injection packaging components used in insulin applications 
orders relating to the hn vaccination effort resulted in an estimated million of sales  and are expected to contribute million to million less than this during also contributing to the increase in packaging components revenues was an increase in sales of flip off seals  mostly within north america 
sales of disposable medical components and safety and administration products were higher by approximately million  due mostly to the introduction of ready to use closures for intravenous bottles in south america 
the remainder of the increase in revenues came from other products and laboratory services sales which were million higher than the prior year 
tech group full year sales were million below levels  including million of unfavorable foreign currency translation 
excluding the impact of foreign currency changes  sales were million  or  below prior year levels 
sales of consumer and personal care products declined by million compared to the prior year as a result of lower plastic resin costs  which are contractually passed through to many tech group customers in the form of adjusted selling prices  our decision to discontinue manufacturing a specific customer s product in mexico and regulatory action which halted sales of one of our customer s products 
the reduction in revenues caused by resin cost pass through adjustments alone was approximately million 
overall sales of healthcare devices  tooling and other excluding foreign currency changes were million higher compared with due to million of incremental sales from our july acquisition of plastef and strong sales of an intra nasal medical device manufactured in europe  partially offset by lower us sales due to customer stock reductions and fewer new product introductions 
compared to consolidated net sales increased by million  or  over those achieved in the prior year 
favorable foreign currency translation accounted for the vast majority of the consolidated sales growth 
sales price increases contributed percentage points to sales growth  as price increases including raw material surcharges were implemented in response to rising raw material and energy costs during the year 
substantially offsetting the impact of sales price increases were lower volumes and unfavorable mix resulting from regulatory and insurance reimbursement related constraints and the discontinuation of certain products  which resulted in lost sales within both reporting segments 
pharmaceutical systems this segment contributed million to the full year sales increase  including million resulting from favorable foreign currency translation 
excluding currency translation effects  sales were million  or  above prior year levels due to the following revenues by product group 
sales of pharmaceutical packaging components excluding foreign currency changes were million higher than the prior year due to increased sales of stoppers and seals used in a variety of customer products 
these increases more than compensated for a decline in sales of a prefillable syringe component caused by regulatory and insurance reimbursement changes affecting the demand for certain customer products designed to treat anemia in cancer and other patients 
sales of disposable medical components were million lower  as sales of other syringe components replaced a portion of the million of sales of a low margin blood collection system component that we ceased producing 
sales of safety and administration systems  and laboratory and other services were million higher than the prior year  most of which was due to increased demand for our drug reconstitution products and higher tooling activity 
tech group full year sales were million below levels  including million of favorable foreign currency translation 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  sales were million  or  below prior year levels as follows 
sales of healthcare devices excluding foreign currency changes decreased million compared with after considering the lost exubera sales of million  we experienced increased sales volume of other healthcare devices including medical filter products  self injection pens  and intra nasal drug delivery systems  partially offset by a drop off in sales of packaging for a customer s over the counter weight loss product following a june market launch 
sales of consumer products  tooling and other services increased by million due to increased volume of juice and dairy carton closures  partially offset by lower demand for certain personal care products and tooling services 
intersegment sales of million and million in and  respectively  were eliminated in consolidation 
the majority of intersegment sales eliminations in all periods presented represent sales of healthcare devices from the tech group to pharmaceutical systems 
information regarding fluctuations in sales by significant product group presented above has been calculated on a constant currency basis 
refer to note  segment information  to the consolidated financial statements for sales by significant product group using actual foreign currency exchange rates 
gross profit the following table summarizes our gross profit and related gross margins by reportable segment year ended december  change in millions pharmaceutical systems gross profit gross margin tech group gross profit gross margin consolidated gross profit consolidated gross margin compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million over full year results  despite an unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of million 
excluding foreign exchange impacts  gross profit increased by million  or  as a result of higher selling prices and a significant fourth quarter increase in volume and mix contributed by pharmaceutical systems 
our overall gross margin percentage remained consistent with the prior year as we were able to maintain margins through sales price increases and improved volume and mix  partially offset by higher depreciation expense as described below 
we expect our gross margin percentage to improve within the next year as a result of improved sales volume and mix and further gains in plant efficiency from lean savings initiatives and recent restructuring efforts 
pharmaceutical systems our reported gross profit of million increased by million compared with the results 
excluding foreign currency translation effects of million  gross profit was million higher than the prior year 
the gross margin percentage for pharmaceutical systems declined by percentage points versus the prior year despite the increase in gross profit 
the decline was attributable to higher depreciation expense resulting from our global capital expansion activity which began in the latter half of  partially offset by improved selling prices 
overall  the price impact on our gross margin percentage was positive as increased selling prices more than offset increases in energy  wages and other production costs experienced during the year 
tech group reported gross profit of million decreased by million compared with the full year results including million in unfavorable foreign currency effects 
excluding the translation effects  gross profit was slightly higher than the prior year 
despite a decrease in gross profit  our profit margin percentage improved slightly to compared with the prior year largely due to the impact of reduced resin costs on selling prices which resulted in a higher ratio of gross profit to revenues 
also contributing to the gross margin improvement was a reduction in plant overhead costs and improved production efficiency resulting from our restructuring efforts in the us and higher production volume within our european operations 
compared to consolidated gross profit increased by million over  including the favorable effect from foreign currency translation of million 
the gross margin percentage improved slightly despite the unfavorable impact on sales volume and mix caused by the loss of discrete business described in the net sales section above 
pharmaceutical systems gross margin for pharmaceutical systems declined by one percentage point versus the prior year 
approximately half of this decrease was due to unfavorable volume and mix resulting from the regulatory and insurance reimbursement issues affecting the demand for prefillable syringe components used in certain anemia products 
the remaining decline resulted from increased depreciation expense and production cost increases  as the positive benefit of sales price increases offset a majority of the increased costs of raw materials  wages and utilities used to operate our production facilities 
tech group gross margins improved by percentage points in comparison to prior year results 
the improved gross margin performance was largely due to a significant reduction in plant overhead and improved production efficiency which contributed percentage points 
these gains resulted from our restructuring efforts and efficiencies from the completion of start up activities at our expanded production facility in michigan 
partially offsetting these increases by percentage points was the impact of lower sales and unfavorable mix 
despite sales increases in consumer products and other healthcare devices  the loss of business associated with the exubera device and the prior year weight loss product launch resulted in a decline in sales and negative impact on gross margin 
during the year  the majority of raw material  energy and wage cost increases were passed on to customers in the form of increased selling prices 
research and development r d costs our development projects are primarily a response to the market opportunities created by the convergence of primary drug packaging and delivery systems and include initiatives in traditional injection systems  components for pen system applications and auto injection systems 
the following table summarizes r d costs by reportable segment in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group total r d costs r d costs during were million higher than those incurred in  mostly due to accelerated development spending on our high value packaging and injection systems and ready to use components 
also contributing to the increase was incremental r d during the second half of resulting from the acquisition of plastef 
r d costs were million higher than those incurred in  mostly due to increased spending on three ongoing development projects in the pharmaceutical systems segment 
these projects included our development of prefillable syringe systems that use daikyo seiko  ltd 
daikyo crystal zenith resin  an advanced injection system using auto injector technology  and a passive needle safety device 
estimated r d spending is expected to exceed levels by approximately as we continue to invest in advanced injectable packaging and delivery systems and safety and reconstitution products 
we anticipate that a majority of our developmental medical devices will be manufactured by our newly formed pharmaceutical delivery systems segment 
we believe that our commitment to develop and apply proprietary technologies that improve the quality  safety and effectiveness of therapeutic and diagnostic healthcare delivery systems will result in continued long term growth

sg a as a percentage of net sales increased by percentage points  the majority of which related to the increase in us pension and other retirement plan costs 
in pharmaceutical systems  excluding the favorable impact from foreign currency translation  sg a expenses increased by million over the prior year amount as a result of several individual items including the following 
other compensation costs were million above those incurred in due to increased staffing of information technology and other necessary technical  manufacturing support and marketing functions and from the impact of annual salary increases 
increased depreciation expense and other costs associated with our and information systems implementations accounted for million of the increase  and costs associated with our acquisition activities and geographic expansion in china accounted for million of the increase 
severance and related benefit costs increased by million  most of which resulted from our decision to consolidate laboratory functions and relocate certain business development center functions 
various other costs including professional services and office facilities costs contributed to the remaining increase in sg a expense compared to the prior year 
sg a costs in the tech group were million higher than the amount incurred in increases during were largely the result of annual salary and compensation increases and costs associated with our information systems upgrades 
general corporate costs include executive and director compensation other than stock based compensation and other corporate administrative and facilities expenses that are not allocated to the segments 
also included in general corporate costs are any above or below target performance adjustments for our worldwide cash bonus program 
annual cash bonus payments are made based on the achievement of sales  operating profit  earnings per share and cash flow targets  and certain qualitative performance milestones 
general corporate costs for were marginally favorable to prior year levels as the impact of annual salary increases was more than offset by lower annual cash bonus costs and reduced amounts of outside professional fees 
stock based compensation costs for increased by million compared to the prior year due to the impact of changes in our stock price on the fair value of our stock price indexed deferred compensation liabilities 
during  our stock price increased per share  closing at per share on december   while during our stock price decreased  closing at per share on december  us pension and other retirement benefits expense in was million higher than the prior year due to increased amortization of actuarial losses and lower expected return on plan assets resulting from the loss in plan asset values during the stock market decline 
the costs of non us pension and other retirement benefits programs are reflected in the operating profit of the respective segment for all periods presented 
compared to consolidated sg a expenses were million above those recorded in  but only increased marginally as a percentage of total net sales 
the impact of foreign currency translation accounted for million of the increase 
in pharmaceutical systems  sg a expenses increased by million over the prior year 
foreign currency translation accounted for million of the increase 
compensation costs were million above those incurred in due to the impact of annual pay increases and increased staffing of information technology support functions 
costs associated with our new information systems implementation  including depreciation expense and third party consulting fees  accounted for million of the increase 
various other increases including utilities and other corporate facilities costs contributed to the remaining increase in sg a expense 
sg a costs in the tech group were million lower than the amount incurred in a net reduction in headcount associated with our restructuring efforts accounted for half of the reduction in sg a 
the remainder of the reduction was attributable to lower amortization expense  resulting from the nektar contract intangible write off  and a reduction in various third party consulting services 
general corporate sg a costs were million favorable to levels 
the majority of the decrease is the result of lower facilities and administrative related costs 
cash based bonus costs were slightly lower than those earned in the prior year based upon management s achievement of targets 
stock based compensation costs for increased by million due to the impact of changes in our stock price on the fair value of our stock price indexed deferred compensation liabilities

certain restructuring  impairments and other discrete gains and losses considered outside the control of segment management are not allocated to our reporting segments 
the following table summarizes our restructuring charges and other income and expense items for each of the three years ended december in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group corporate unallocated charges credits impairment charge  contract settlement and related gain  net restructuring and related charges brazil tax penalties and amnesty benefits total unallocated charges credits total restructuring  impairment and other charges the reduction in other expense for pharmaceutical systems is attributable to a lesser amount of foreign exchange losses on intercompany and third party transactions recognized during compared with for tech group  the increase in other expense resulted primarily from the recognition of foreign exchange transaction losses in compared with gains in the year 
impairment charge  contract settlement and related gain  net during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a cost basis investment that arose from the divestiture of a former drug delivery business was impaired and we recorded a million charge to write off our investment 
we do not expect any further charges associated with this investment 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge representing our net book value in the nektar contract intangible asset associated with the exubera device 
under an agreement reached with nektar in february  we received full reimbursement for  among other things  severance related employee costs  equipment  purchased raw materials and components  leases and other facility costs associated with the shutdown of manufacturing operations related to this device 
during  we received payments from nektar which more than offset the related costs incurred  resulting in a net gain of million 
restructuring and related charges during the fourth quarter of  we recognized restructuring and other charges of million  comprised of employee severance and benefits costs of million  asset impairment and accelerated depreciation of million  and million in asset relocation costs 
during  we also incurred million in restructuring costs  consisting mostly of employee severance benefits  asset impairments  and accelerated depreciation associated with the completion of our tech group restructuring program 
during and  we incurred million and million  respectively  as part of the tech group restructuring plan 
the majority of these charges in each year related to severance and post employment benefits and a smaller portion resulted from asset impairments and accelerated depreciation and other related costs 
brazil tax penalties and amnesty benefits in september  we enrolled in a tax amnesty program which provided for reduced penalties and interest on certain tax related obligations 
during  we increased our accruals for a series of social  excise and other tax contingencies in brazil by million 
these charges followed a detailed review of several related tax cases pending in the brazilian courts  which indicated that it was probable that our positions taken on previous tax returns  some of which date back to the late s  would not be sustained 
refer to note  restructuring and other items  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the restructuring  impairment and other items within this section 
operating profit operating profit loss by reportable segment  corporate and other unallocated costs was as follows in millions pharmaceutical systems tech group corporate and other unallocated costs general corporate costs stock based compensation costs us pension expenses other unallocated items consolidated operating profit compared to our combined segment operating profit decreased by million from that achieved in the prior year  including an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of million 
the pharmaceutical systems segment s results were lower by million as a result of higher general and administrative and r d costs and unfavorable foreign currency changes  offset partially by increased gross profit 
excluding a million unfavorable foreign exchange impact  pharmaceutical systems operating profit exceeded the amount by million 
tech group operating profit was million below that achieved in the prior year  largely due to increased general and administrative costs and a decline in gross profit on lower sales 
consolidated operating profit for and was reduced by corporate and unallocated costs of million and million  respectively 
the majority of these increased costs related to the us pension and other retirement benefits expense  as described in the selling  general and administrative costs section above  and restructuring  impairment and other unallocated charges 
compared to the combined segment operating profit increased by million from that achieved in the year  including a favorable foreign exchange impact of million 
pharmaceutical systems operating profit was lower than prior year results by million  including a foreign currency translation benefit of million 
the impact of higher sales and gross profit was more than offset by higher spending on information systems and research and development initiatives as we replaced outdated management reporting systems and invested in innovative products for the future 
tech group operating profit was million above that achieved in the prior year  including a foreign currency benefit of million  largely due to savings resulting from the restructuring program initiated in late  and production efficiencies coming from higher throughput at our recently expanded michigan facility 
consolidated operating profit for and also included corporate and unallocated costs of million and million  respectively 
the majority of this decrease related to other unallocated items which are described in the restructuring  impairment and other items section above 
interest expense  net the following table summarizes our net interest expense in millions interest expense capitalized interest interest income interest expense  net compared to consolidated interest expense  net for was relatively consistent with the prior year  as lower interest rates reduced both interest expense on our variable rate revolving credit facility and interest income on bank deposits 
in addition  we held less cash on average during as compared with the prior year 
the majority of capitalized interest during both and resulted from our plant expansion projects in europe and the construction of our new plastics plant in china 
compared to consolidated interest expense  net during increased million compared with the prior year 
interest expense for the year was million above that recorded in the timing of our issuance of million in convertible debt in march and april of accounted for million of the full year increase  as the notes were outstanding for the entire year compared to a partial year in the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and bank commitment fees accounted for another million of the increase 
the decrease in interest income is also largely due to the timing of the convertible debt issuance  as a portion of the proceeds was invested in money market accounts and a strategic cash management fund in the first half of  and then subsequently used in our stock buy back program and in our capital expansion programs 
in addition  interest income was reduced by other than temporary losses on our strategic cash management fund investment totaling million in capitalized interest increased as a result of our pharmaceutical systems capital expansion projects in europe 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in  in and in the following discrete items affected the comparability of effective tax rates in versus in  we recognized a million net tax provision benefit principally resulting from the completion of a tax audit and the expiration of open tax periods in various tax jurisdictions 
we recognized tax credits of million in resulting from the identification of additional qualified r d activities related to prior years  and other tax provision benefits of million primarily from the reversal of valuation allowances on prior year tax losses carried forward 
in  an agreement with the republic of singapore reduced our income tax rate in that country for a period of years  on a retroactive basis back to july  resulting in a million tax benefit 
a united kingdom tax law change effectively eliminated a portion of our capital allowance carryforwards  resulting in a million increase in our tax provision 
also in  we recognized a million net tax provision benefit resulting from the expiration of open audit years in various tax jurisdictions  and million in other discrete benefits including reversals of us state valuation allowances and provision adjustments for returns filed in during  we recognized a pre tax benefit of million relating to our participation in the tax amnesty program in brazil along with the related income tax provision of million 
the impact of these items and the tax effect on restructuring  impairment and other charges reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points in and percentage points in excluding these items mentioned above  our effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate resulted from a larger amount of us foreign tax credits on taxes paid in certain foreign jurisdictions and increased current year development activities that qualified for r d tax credits 
in addition to the factors listed above  the following items impacted the comparability of the tax rate in versus in  we recognized a million provision benefit related to tax credits originally generated and fully reserved in previous periods 
we recorded a million tax provision benefit in principally resulting from the revision of tax planning strategies and the completion of related documentation supporting prior year r d credits  and a million tax benefit due to the closure of certain us federal and state tax audit years 
the impact of these two items and the restructuring activities reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points 
excluding these items in both years results in an effective tax rate of in and in  the decrease resulting from a change in geographic mix of earnings and an increase in r d tax benefits in the us and ireland 
our anticipated effective tax rate for the year ending december  is expected to be relatively consistent with that of  absent the impact of discrete items or legislative changes in tax rates 
equity in net income of affiliates equity in net income from our ownership interest in daikyo in japan and our ownership interest in three companies in mexico was million  million  and million for the years  and  respectively 
the significant increase in equity earnings for versus came from daikyo  as their sales were above prior year levels  and their gross margins improved by percentage points 
contributing to the improvement were higher sales of various pharmaceutical packaging components  an increase in royalty income and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
also  results were adversely affected by significant charges for plant demolition and higher pension costs  as described below 
our equity income was million lower than the prior year due to reduced earnings of daikyo 
the lower earnings were primarily the result of plant demolition and disposal costs  as well as incremental depreciation expense associated with a significant crystal zenith capital expansion project and pension plan termination costs 
purchases from affiliates totaled million in  million in and million in  the majority of which related to a distributorship agreement with daikyo which allows us to purchase and re sell daikyo products 
sales to affiliates were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations in was million  a decrease of million over diluted earnings per share in was  a decrease of per diluted share compared with the prior year

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources cash flow activity the following table and explanations provide cash flow data from continuing operations for the years ended december  in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities our operating cash flows increased million compared to the prior year 
the lower net income in the current year  net of an increased amount of non cash charges such as depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation  was more than offset by favorable variances in other assets and liabilities including lower cash paid for taxes in compared with the prior year 
included in net cash provided by operating activities was a million voluntary contribution to our us qualified pension plan  compared with no contributions made during included in operating cash flow was a million payment for income tax and other tax related issues in brazil 
operating cash flow increased million in compared to the prior year  including million in proceeds received from our contract settlement with nektar  partially offset by related cash costs of million 
our favorable cash flow from operating results and the impact of this contract settlement was reduced by the payment of income and other tax related liabilities in brazil totaling million 
operating cash flows in also reflected significant cash payments related to tax issues in brazil 
during  we paid million to escrow representing judicial deposits for the benefit of the brazil government to avoid further accretion of interest and penalties on tax related liabilities 
after considering these items  the cash flows from operating activities were slightly lower than  as increased earnings in were offset by cash outflows for changes in working capital and other assets and liabilities 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million higher than the amount as a result of increased spending on a business acquisition and fewer cash redemptions of short term investments  partially offset by decreased capital spending 
during  cash redemptions from short term investments were million less than the prior year  the majority of which related to the liquidation of our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund  which was fully redeemed at december  see note  fair value of financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund 
cash paid to acquire the plastef business assets and other acquisition related earnouts paid during totaled million 
capital spending in totaled million  a million decrease over the prior year 
pharmaceutical systems spending was million  a decrease of million over the prior year resulting from the completion of several major plant expansion projects that began during and were placed into service during in the aggregate  we spent million less for capital expansion projects in compared to the prior year  a portion of which was the result of discretionary reductions in spending as we postponed certain components of our expansion plans in response to the recessionary impacts on market demand 
the remainder of the decrease related to lower spending on information technology projects as our project to replace our north american procurement and plant operations systems was completed in the fourth quarter of tech group capital spending was million  an increase of million compared to the prior year 
the remainder of the decrease relates to changes in the balance of accrued capital spending compared to the change 
in  cash flows used in investing activities were million less than the prior year  despite a million increase in capital spending 
the majority of the year over year decrease resulted from million in redemptions from the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund  compared to million in net purchases in capital spending totaled million in compared with million in the prior year 
pharmaceutical systems spending was million  an increase of million over the prior year 
the increase was the result of major projects to increase our manufacturing capacity  including the expansion of our rubber compounding capacity in kinston  north carolina  and ongoing plant expansion projects in europe and asia 
a portion of the total spending increase pertained to information technology as we replaced our financial reporting  cash disbursements and order to cash systems in north america 
tech group capital spending was million  a decrease of million compared to the prior year 
spending in was higher due to our grand rapids  michigan plant expansion project 
the remainder of the increase relates to a change in the balance of accrued capital spending compared to the change 
cash flows from financing activities the year over year decrease in cash used for financing activities was the result of payments made in to acquire the remaining noncontrolling interest in our medimop subsidiaries  partially offset by a larger amount of debt repayment and higher dividend payments in compared to cash flows used in financing activities for included million in net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million in payments of short term notes and capital leases compared with combined net debt repayments of million in we paid cash dividends totaling million per share during  compared to million per share and million per share in and  respectively 
we expect to continue our quarterly dividend program  subject to annual board of directors approval 
in  the majority of the year over year decrease in cash flows from financing activities resulted from the issuance of long term debt  partially offset by stock repurchase activity and the acquisition of the remaining non controlling ownership of medimop for million 
cash flows used in financing activities for included million in net repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million in new issuances of short term notes payable

these net proceeds provided funds used in the reduction of revolving credit facility borrowings totaling million 
during  we initiated and completed an open market repurchase program under which we acquired  shares of common stock at total cost of million per share 
liquidity measures the table below displays key liquidity measures for west as of december in millions cash and cash equivalents working capital current ratio to to to total debt net debt to total invested capital short term investments that have maturities of ninety days or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents 
working capital is defined as current assets less current liabilities 
current ratio is defined as the ratio of current assets to current liabilities 
net debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  and total invested capital is defined as the sum of net debt and total shareholders equity 
working capital at december  increased million compared with the balance at december   reflecting higher trade accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by increased accrued liabilities balances 
both accounts receivable and inventory increased due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and from the addition of assets acquired from plastef in july in addition  accounts receivable was higher as a result of a significant increase in fourth quarter sales  and inventory increased due to an increase in strategic stock of certain raw materials and higher finished goods balances 
our accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso ratio was days at december  compared to days at december   and our inventory turnover ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
included in working capital at december  and was cash held in escrow representing judicial deposits for the government of brazil related to various tax positions taken in prior years and the related tax liabilities 
the escrow balance recorded in other current assets at december  was million which will be used to settle our outstanding tax related obligations in that country 
as a result of the brazil tax amnesty program  we estimate that million in excess deposits will be returned to us over the next twelve months as the underlying tax cases are settled 
the ratio of net debt to total invested capital decreased by percentage points compared with the prior year as a result of our debt repayments and increases in other comprehensive income resulting from foreign currency translation and current year earnings net of dividends 
the million decrease in total debt resulted from million in cash payments  partially offset by foreign exchange increases of million and million in capital leases acquired from plastef 
based on our business outlook and our capital structure at the close of  we believe that we have ample liquidity to fund our business needs  new product development  capital expansion  pension and other post retirement benefits and to pay dividends 
we expect that our cash requirements for the foreseeable future will be met primarily through our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents on hand  and amounts available under our million multi currency unsecured committed revolving credit agreement  which we generally use for working capital requirements 
as of december   we had available million of borrowing capacity under this facility  and we have not experienced any limit on our ability to access this source of funds 
amounts outstanding under this revolving credit agreement are currently classified as long term debt based upon our intent and ability to refinance amounts borrowed on a long term basis 
due to the fact that this facility expires in february of  any amounts outstanding under this facility as of the end of our first quarter in will need to be reclassified to current liabilities 
we currently intend to enter into a replacement facility prior to the february expiry date 
market conditions could affect the cost and terms of the replacement facility  as well as terms of other debt instruments we enter into from time to time 
to date  we have not experienced any significant increase in customer collectibility risks  nor have we experienced increased supply risks due to vendor insolvency 
we do not expect that recent global credit market conditions will have a significant impact on our liquidity  however  no assurance can be given that the ongoing economic downturn will not have a material adverse effect on our demand for products  liquidity or capital resources 
commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at december  these obligations are not expected to have a material impact on liquidity 
payments due by period in millions less than year to years to years more than years total unconditional purchase obligations notes payable and long term debt interest on long term debt and interest rate swaps operating lease obligations pensions other post retirement obligations total contractual obligations for fixed rate long term debt  interest was based on principal amounts and fixed coupon rates at year end 
future interest payments on variable rate debt were calculated using principal amounts and the applicable ending interest rate at year end 
interest on fixed rate derivative instruments was based on notional amounts and fixed interest rates contractually obligated at year end 
reserves for uncertain tax positions the table above does not include million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and approximately million of associated accrued interest as of december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential cash flows  we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement periods for amounts which may be paid 
letters of credit we have letters of credit totaling million supporting the reimbursement of workers compensation and other claims paid on our behalf by insurance carriers and to guarantee equipment lease payments in ireland and the payment of sales tax liabilities in the us the accrual for insurance obligations was million at december  unconditional purchase obligations our business creates a need to enter into various commitments with suppliers 
in accordance with us gaap  these purchase obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business 
foreign currency contracts we periodically enter into foreign currency contracts to reduce our exposure to variability in cash flows related to anticipated purchases of raw materials and other inventory denominated in non functional currencies 
we also enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate exposure of non functional currency asset and liability balances to changes in exchange rates 
as of december   the liability at a fair value of our foreign currency hedge contract was million  which was not reflected in the above table 
pension other post retirement obligations our objective in funding the us tax qualified pension plan is to accumulate funds sufficient to provide for all benefits and to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of erisa 
our annual funding decision also takes into account the extent to which the benefit obligation exceeds its corresponding funded status 
outside of the us  our objective is to fund the retirement costs over time within the limits of minimum requirements and allowable tax deductions 
the table above reflects an estimated minimum us qualified pension plan contribution in the amount of million 
the amounts and timing of future company contributions to the defined benefit and other post retirement pension plans are unknown because they are dependent on pension fund asset performance  as well as other factors 
the non qualified defined benefit pension plans and post retirement medical plans are generally not funded in advance 
off balance sheet agreements at december   the company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases and unconditional purchase obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and outstanding letters of credit related to various insurance programs and leased equipment and sales tax liability guarantees as noted above 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis addresses consolidated financial statements that are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the application of these principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions  some of which are subjective and complex  that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding and evaluating our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is generated from our product manufacturing operations which convert rubber  metal  and plastic raw materials into parts used in closure systems and syringe components for use with injectable drugs and drug delivery devices 
sales of manufactured components are recorded at the time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
some customers receive pricing rebates upon attaining established sales volumes 
management records rebate costs when the sales occur based on its assessment of the likelihood that these volumes will be attained 
we also establish product return liabilities for customer quality claims when such amounts are deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
impairment of long lived assets we review goodwill and other long lived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment as part of the reporting unit to which it belongs 
our reporting units are the same as our operating segments  which we have determined to be the americas and europe asia pacific divisions of the pharmaceutical systems segment and the americas and europe divisions of our tech group segment 
for assets held and used in the business  management estimates the future cash flows to be derived from the related asset or business unit 
when assets are held for sale  management determines fair value by estimating the anticipated proceeds to be received upon the sale of the asset  less disposition costs 
changes in the estimate of fair value  including the estimate of future cash flows  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
employee benefits we sponsor qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the us and in a number of other countries 
in addition  we sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans  which provide healthcare benefits for eligible employees who retire or are disabled 
the measurement of the annual cost and obligations under our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans is subject to a number of assumptions 
us gaap accounting for compensation and retirement benefits requires companies to use an expected long term rate of asset return assumption for computing current year pension expense 
for us plans  which accounted for of global plan assets  the long term rate of return assumption was in and in the prior two years 
this assumption is reviewed annually and determined by the projected return for our target mix of plan assets approximately equity and debt securities 
differences between the actual and expected returns are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as actuarial gains or losses 
the accounting standards also require companies to discount future obligations back to today s dollars using an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rate selected is the single rate equivalent for a theoretical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds that produces a cash flow pattern equivalent to our plans projected benefit payments 
an increase in the discount rate decreases the pension benefit obligation 
this decrease is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently amortized into earnings as an actuarial gain 
changes in key assumptions  including the market performance of plan assets and other actuarial assumptions  could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position 
we estimate that every basis point reduction in the long term rate of return assumption would increase pension expense by million  and a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by million 
the discount rate used in determining the us pension plans benefit obligation at december  decreased basis points to  to reflect market conditions at that time 
as of december   pre tax actuarial losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to pension and other retirement benefits were million  including a current year actuarial gain of million compared with a actuarial loss of million 
we estimate that our pension costs will be approximately lower than as a result of improved plan asset performance and other changes in assumptions 
us gaap requires the recognition of an asset or liability for the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as measured by the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation 
for a pension plan  the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation  for any other postretirement plan  such as a retiree health plan  the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 
for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual return of  compared to a loss of in  resulting in an improvement in funded status during compared to the significant decline in funded status during the prior year 
partially offsetting the improvement was a decrease in our weighted average discount rate from at december  to at december   which increased our pension plan liability 
our net pension underfunded balance at december  was million compared to million at december  our underfunded balance for other postretirement benefits was million and million at december  and  respectively 
income taxes we estimate income taxes payable based upon current domestic and international tax legislation 
in addition  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established to recognize differences between the tax basis and financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the recoverability of tax assets is subject to our estimates of future profitability  generally at the respective subsidiary company and country level 
changes in tax legislation  business plans and other factors may affect the ultimate recoverability of tax assets or final tax payments  which could result in adjustments to tax expense in the period such change is determined 
on january   we adopted the requirements for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements which prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in the recognition of net tax assets that met the more likely than not threshold of million and was reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for please refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  new accounting standards  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on accounting and reporting standards considered in the preparation and presentation of our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risk factors such as fluctuating interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and increasing commodity prices 
these risk factors can impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
to manage these risks  we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  call options and forward exchange contracts for periods consistent with and for notional amounts equal to or less than the underlying exposures 
in accordance with company policy  derivative financial instruments are not used for speculation or trading purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we have subsidiaries outside the us accounting for over of consolidated net sales 
virtually all of these sales and related operating costs are denominated in the currency of the local country and translated into us dollars for consolidated reporting purposes 
although the majority of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in the functional currency of the subsidiary  they may also hold assets or liabilities not denominated in other currencies 
these items may give rise to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
as a result  our results of operations and financial position are exposed to changing currency exchange rates 
we periodically use forward contracts to hedge certain transactions or to neutralize month end balance sheet exposures on cross currency intercompany loans 
as of december   we have entered into a forward exchange contract hedging a non functional currency obligation with a fair value of million at december  in addition  we have designated our million euro denominated notes as a hedge of our investment in the net assets of our european operations 
we also have a billion yen denominated note payable which has been designated as a hedge of our investment in a japanese affiliate 
at december   a cumulative foreign currency translation loss on these net investment hedges of million net of tax of million was recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk as a result of our normal borrowing activities  we have long term debt with both fixed and variable interest rates 
long term debt consists of senior notes  convertible debentures  revolving credit facilities and capital lease obligations 
our exposures to fluctuations in interest rates are managed to the extent considered necessary by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the following table summarizes our interest rate risk sensitive instruments in millions thereafter carrying value fair value current debt and capital leases euro denominated average interest rate fixed real denominated average interest rate fixed long term debt and capital leases us dollar denominated average interest rate variable us dollar denominated average interest rate fixed euro denominated average interest rate fixed british pound denominated average interest rate fixed yen denominated average interest rate variable as of december   we have two interest rate swap agreements outstanding which are designed to protect against volatility in variable interest rates payable on a million note maturing on july  series a note and a million note maturing july  series b note 
the first interest rate swap agreement has a notional amount of million and corresponds to the maturity date of the series a note and the second interest rate swap has a notional amount of million and corresponds with the maturity date of the series b note 
under each of the swap agreements we will receive variable interest rate payments based on three month libor in return for making quarterly fixed payments 
the interest rate swap agreements effectively fix the interest rates payable on our series a and b notes at and  respectively 
at december   the interest rate swap agreements had a fair value of million  unfavorable to the company  and are recorded as a noncurrent liability 
commodity price risk many of our pharmaceutical systems products are made from synthetic elastomers  which are derived from the petroleum refining process 
we purchase the majority of our elastomers via long term supply contracts  some of which contain clauses that provide for surcharges related to changes in crude oil prices 
in december  we purchased a series of crude oil call options for a total of  barrels of crude oil  which are intended to reduce our exposure to increases in oil based surcharges and protect operating cash flows with regard to a portion of our forecasted elastomer purchases during the months of july through december these call options cap our cost of the crude oil component of elastomer prices for a portion of our forecasted purchases  allowing us to limit our exposure to increasing petroleum prices 
with these option contracts  we may benefit from a decline in crude oil prices  as there is no downward exposure other than the premium that we paid to purchase the contracts 
these call options were not designated as hedging instruments
