risk factors 
overview corporate highlights peramivir in january  hhs awarded us a million  four year contract for the advanced development of peramivir 
in september  we received an award of million toward completion of the phase iii development of iv peramivir pursuant to a contract modification with hhs 
this additional funding brings the total award from hhs for the development of peramivir to million and extends the contract term by months to five years 
any funding above the million may be our responsibility 
we have determined that there is an excess of up to million of peramivir active pharmaceutical ingredient api manufactured under the contract with hhs 
this excess api is beyond the amount necessary to support us regulatory approval 
hhs has acknowledged that at least half of the company s estimate is excess 
we are evaluating whether additional quantities of peramivir api are needed by the company  and if so  the acquisition process to obtain the api from hhs 
in september  we received a rfp from hhs for the supply of iv peramivir for the treatment of critically ill influenza patients under an emergency use authorization eua 
on november  we received an initial order for  courses of iv peramivir mg once daily for five days for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we shipped the entire order from existing iv peramivir inventory to hhs on november  under the indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract issued to us on november   hhs may place additional orders for peramivir up to a total of  courses at the same unit price as the first order 
we are also required to maintain the ability to manufacture additional treatment courses dependent on the volume and size of anti viral orders received from hhs 
in addition  separate from the rfp process  we have donated and transferred to hhs an initial supply sufficient for  courses of iv peramivir mg once daily for five days 
the minimum and maximum quantities of iv peramivir that may be ordered by hhs under the rfp are  and  treatment courses 
we also are required to maintain the ability to manufacture additional courses for treatment or prophylaxis  dependent on the volume and size of orders received from hhs 
based on the rfp  we initiated manufacture of approximately  courses of iv peramivir at a cost of approximately million  so that we would have additional inventory available in advance of potential orders 
in addition  we have sufficient quantities of api of iv peramivir available to produce up to  additional courses 
in october  the fda  in response to a request from the us centers for disease control and prevention  issued an eua for permitting the use of iv peramivir in hospitalized adult and pediatric patients with confirmed or suspected hn influenza infection who have not responded to oral or inhaled antivirals or in whom oral or inhaled antiviral therapy is not feasible  and in adult patients for whom therapy with an iv drug is judged clinically appropriate due to other circumstances 

table of contents in addition to the contract with hhs  in february  we established a collaborative relationship with shionogi for the development and commercialization of peramivir in japan 
we received an upfront payment of million and the agreement provided for additional future clinical event milestone payments of up to million 
in october  we and shionogi amended the license agreement to expand the territory in the agreement to include taiwan and to provide rights for shionogi to perform a phase iii clinical trial in hong kong 
in july  shionogi announced positive results in two phase iii clinical trials of iv peramivir 
the studies were sponsored by shionogi and conducted during the influenza season 
shionogi and green cross corporation green cross  the license holder of peramivir in korea pursuant to a june license agreement with us  co conducted the portion of the studies in korea 
doses of iv peramivir of mg and mg  administered in single and multiple doses  were found to be generally safe and well tolerated in these trials 
shionogi presented the data at the icaac idsa annual meeting in san francisco  california 
shionogi previously completed a phase ii study of iv peramivir administered via a single dose infusion in the outpatient setting for treatment of seasonal influenza 
shionogi presented the data at the icaac idsa annual meeting in washington  dc in january  shionogi received marketing and manufacturing approval for iv peramivir in japan 
the filing of this application triggered a million milestone payment to us under our current license agreement  and we received a third and final regulatory milestone payment of million in january as a result of the application s approval 
we may receive future commercial event milestone payments of up to million from shionogi 
shionogi has commercially launched peramivir under the commercial name rapiacta in japan 
shionogi has received the indications of single dose administration of mg iv peramivir for adult uncomplicated seasonal influenza infection  as well as single and multiple dose administration of mg iv peramivir for the patients at high risk for complications associated with influenza 
shionogi is authorized to supply peramivir as either a mg iv bag or a mg vial for iv drip infusion 
shionogi also announced that it has completed clinical studies for pediatric patients and has filed an additional application for pediatric use of rapiacta in japan 
additionally  in january  green cross filed a new drug application in south korea in january to seek regulatory approval for iv peramivir to treat patients with influenza 
in addition to shionogi and green cross  we have entered into several agreements with companies outside the us to represent us and peramivir primarily for stockpiling opportunities 
for example  on december   we entered into an agreement with merck serono  sa  through its affiliate  ares trading sa  to exclusively represent us and peramivir for stockpiling opportunities in europe  russia  canada and singapore 
also in december  we entered into an agreement with hikma pharmaceuticals  plc to represent us and peramivir for stockpiling opportunities in the middle east and north africa  excluding israel 
in january  we entered into an agreement with moksha pharmaceuticals  inc to exclusively represent us and peramivir for influenza stockpiling opportunities in brazil and mexico 
intramuscular peramivir 
we completed a double blind placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial with im peramivir testing two different dose levels of peramivir mg and mg versus placebo in adults with acute uncomplicated influenza 
while the trial did not demonstrate statistically significant differences for its primary endpoint of time to alleviation of symptoms  the preliminary analysis of the virologic data indicated that peramivir demonstrated statistically significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both peramivir treatment groups compared to placebo  with greater reductions in the mg dose 
with this information and the additional pharmacokinetic information we have obtained subsequent to the trial  we initiated a phase ii placebo controlled trial of mg im peramivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza 
in may  we announced preliminary results from the phase ii study of im peramivir for the treatment of seasonal influenza 
this phase ii study was a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial conducted in influenza seasons in the southern hemisphere australia  new zealand and south africa in and the northern hemisphere united states in to while the study demonstrated a numerical trend in its primary endpoint of improvement in the median time to alleviation of symptoms ttas in subjects with confirmed  acute  uncomplicated influenza infection versus placebo  the difference between the two study groups was not statistically significant 
we are not planning additional development of im peramivir at this time 

table of contents intravenous peramivir 
in july  we initiated a phase ii clinical trial of iv peramivir to compare the efficacy and safety of iv peramivir to orally administered oseltamivir in patients who require hospitalization due to acute influenza 
the primary objective of the study was to evaluate time to clinical stability  which is a composite endpoint comprised of normalization of temperature  oxygen saturation  respiratory rate  systolic blood pressure and heart rate 
this type of endpoint has previously been used in pneumonia studies  but not in influenza 
secondary objectives of the study included evaluation of viral shedding  mortality  clinical relapse and time to resumption of usual activities 
we presented the results at the xi international symposium on respiratory viral infection being held in bangkok  thailand in february in september we announced that we are initiating two phase iii studies of iv peramivir for the treatment of hospitalized patients with serious influenza 
the combined enrollment target for these studies is approximately patients  and approximately study locations are targeted to participate in these studies globally 
these studies are intended to support us regulatory approval of us peramivir as a treatment for influenza 
forodesine an oral formulation of forodesine is currently in a pivotal trial for patients with ctcl 
this trial is being conducted under an spa agreement negotiated with the fda and  if successful  will serve as a basis for an nda to the fda using the oral formulation in patients with relapsed ctcl 
in january  we announced that we had achieved our protocol specific objective of enrolling late stage patients stage iib to iva in this pivotal study 
we expect to report top line data on this study in the second half of long term data from our phase ii study of forodesine in patients with ctcl was presented at the th annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology 
this poster presentation reviewed the safety and efficacy of forodesine for ctcl patients of stage ib to stage iv who have failed standard therapies and received forodesine treatment for greater than months 
in december  we announced interim data from the ongoing forodesine phase ii program in patients with cll and data from a healthy subject pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study 
top line study results are expected in the second half of bcx during the third quarter of  roche initiated a phase iia clinical trial to evaluate oral doses of bcx r in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
the efficacy assessment of the study has been completed 
consistent with interim findings reported by us in may  the phase ii clinical study of bcx  a potent  rationally designed  orally available pnp inhibitor  met its primary objectives of safety and tolerability 
in addition  bcx displayed dose dependent reductions in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts  including subsets measuring b cells cd  total t cells cd  t helper cells cd and t suppressor cytotoxic cells cd 
further  plasma levels of bcx increased with dose  and plasma uric acid levels showed dose related reductions with bcx in addition  consistent with interim results previously reported by us  no evidence of clinical efficacy  a secondary objective  was observed in psoriasis patients with doses and duration of administration tested 
in the phase iia trial  bcx was generally safe and well tolerated at doses up to mg daily for six weeks 
most adverse events reported were considered mild or moderate  and low in frequency 
no opportunistic infections were observed 
in addition  detailed laboratory and clinical monitoring did not indicate any patterns suggestive of off target adverse findings 
also in may  we received notice that roche was exercising the no cause termination right under the license agreement for bcx as a result  we regained worldwide rights to bcx we recently initiated a clinical study of bcx for the treatment of gout  which is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in blood 
we believe that bcx is a good candidate to control gout because data from a prior phase 
table of contents ii clinical trial of bcx for psoriasis indicated a dose related to reduction in uric acid that was sustained for the duration of drug exposure 
our gout clinical trial is a phase ii  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bcx in subjects with gout 
the trial contains two parts part will study multiple doses of bcx against a placebo and part will study dose escalation 
the trial s primary objective is to determine the effect of different doses of orally administered bcx on serum uric acid levels in patients with gout 
the trial is expected to enroll up to subjects and we expect to have initial data from part in mid results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was driven by million in product sales  primarily the million order of  courses of iv peramivir from hhs  as well as a million milestone payment from our partner  shionogi  related to its filing of an nda to seek regulatory approval for iv peramivir in japan 
in addition  revenue from the contract with hhs for the development of peramivir increased by million during the current year as two global phase iii studies were initiated 
these increases were offset by lower amortization of deferred revenue from our collaborative arrangements 
specifically  million of previously deferred revenue was recognized during the prior year as roche terminated its collaboration with us in cost of product sales for the year ended december  were approximately million 
included in cost of product sales is a million provision for peramivir finished goods inventory 
we expense costs related to the production of inventories as research and development expenses in the period incurred until such time it is believed that future economic benefit is expected to be recognized  which generally is reliant upon receipt of regulatory approval 
upon regulatory approval  we capitalize subsequent costs related to the production of inventories 
we determined that the fda s granting of the eua for peramivir in october was objective and persuasive evidence that supported capitalization of peramivir inventories manufactured after the issuance of the eua 
as a result  we recorded manufacturing costs of million for peramivir finished goods inventory 
however  in preparing our december  financial statements  we evaluated whether the costs capitalized as inventory would be recoverable in a future period 
given the lack of objective  reliable evidence to support future demand for peramivir  we concluded that there was no certainty that future sales would materialize and revenues would exceed the costs incurred 
therefore  the capitalized inventory was fully reserved 
the remaining amounts included in cost of product sales for the year ended december  relate to components  secondary packaging  and royalties and commissions paid to third parties as a result of the peramivir product sales 
no costs for the manufacturing of the peramivir finished goods were included in cost of product sales  as the manufacturing was completed prior to the issuance of the eua 
until we sell the inventory for which costs were previously expensed  our cost of product sales will reflect only incremental costs incurred subsequent to the issuance of the eua in october as such  if we sell that portion of our existing inventory  there will be a period of time where revenue could be recognized with little or no corresponding cost 
therefore  we anticipate that the gross margin on future product sales  if any  will fluctuate and not be comparable from quarter to quarter 
research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for the prior year due to reductions of million in clinical development costs  million in manufacturing costs  and million in toxicology costs for the forodesine program  as well as lower costs of million related to our pre clinical compounds and million in general operating and personnel related costs 
in addition  million of previously deferred expense was recognized during the prior year as roche terminated its collaboration with us in these decreases were offset by higher clinical development costs of million for peramivir and million for bcx  as well as an increase of million in manufacturing and million in consulting fees for the peramivir program 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for this increase was primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees 

table of contents interest income for was million as compared to million for the prior year  due to a lower average cash and securities balance as well as significantly lower yield earned on interest bearing assets 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for the year ended december  year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was partially driven by a reduction of million in revenue from the contract with hhs for the development of peramivir 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge to revenues for amounts that were denied reimbursement by hhs related to costs incurred in the phase iii program of im peramivir for outpatient influenza 
we initiated this program and voluntarily discontinued it following a decision to pursue higher doses in the ongoing phase ii study 
reimbursement of these costs is under discussion with hhs 
further contributing to the decrease in collaborative and other r d revenues from to was the receipt of a million milestone payment from shionogi in this was offset by the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue related to the termination of our collaboration with roche in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in r d expenses was due to a reduction in the clinical development costs of million and toxicology costs of million associated with the peramivir program  a reduction in manufacturing costs of million and million associated with the peramivir and forodesine programs  respectively  and a reduction in costs incurred on our pre clinical compounds of million 
these reductions were offset by an increase in our clinical development costs of million for forodesine  the recognition of million of previously deferred expense related to the termination of our collaboration with roche  and increases of million in personnel related costs  consulting fees  and operating costs 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the higher expenses were primarily due to increases in professional fees and operating costs 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or per share 
liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since our inception 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity securities and cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements  including government contracts 
for example  during  we closed a registered offering of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in proceeds net of offering costs of million  and received cash from our collaborative partners primarily hhs  mundipharma  and shionogi of approximately million 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we received million from hhs as a result of the peramivir stockpiling order 
other sources of funding have included the following other collaborative and other research and development agreements  government grants  equipment lease financing  facility leases  research grants  and 
table of contents interest income 
we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities in general and specifically related to our clinical trial activity 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical products advance through later stages of development 
the objective of our investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds  as well as maintaining liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements 
we place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies  and government agencies in order to limit the amount of our credit exposure 
we have not realized any significant losses from investments 
during and  we incurred capital costs of approximately million and million  respectively 
in  we incurred capital costs of approximately million 
included in capital costs were amounts related to a renovation of our facility to build additional laboratory space 
at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of approximately  in   in  and  in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facilities 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following payments under our contract with hhs  our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  and lease or loan financing and future public or private financing 
for the year  our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities balance has increased from million as of december  to million as of december  excluding the million registered offering and the million received from hhs for peramivir stockpiling  our net cash burn for was million  or million per month 
during the third quarter of  we had announced that our net cash use for would be near the top end of the previous guidance range of to million 
for  we expect that cash use will be between and million 
our cash use will vary depending on clinical outcomes and could vary significantly from our expectations depending on the timing of company expenses and the related reimbursement from our collaborators 
as our clinical programs continue to progress and patient enrollment increases  our costs will increase 
our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development  manufacturing  regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required for the continuing development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses 
our expenses  revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors  including our ability to raise additional capital  the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates  the amount and timing of funding we receive from hhs for peramivir  the amount of funding or assistance  if any  we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates  the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug products  the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the progression of our other programs 
with the funds available at december  and future amounts that are expected to be received from hhs  shionogi  and our other collaborators  we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 
table of contents the next twelve months 
however  this is a forward looking statement  and there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including our ability to perform under the contract with hhs and receive reimbursement  the progress and magnitude of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships or government contracts  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions  biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties  the extent to which our partners  including governmental agencies will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves  our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for certain drug candidates  or a decision to build or expand internal development and commercial capabilities  successful commercialization of marketed products by either us or a partner  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify and evaluate drug candidates  our ability to engage sites and enroll subjects in our clinical trials  the scope of manufacturing of our drug candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials  increases in personnel and related costs to support the development of our drug candidates  the scope of manufacturing of our drug substance and drug products required for future nda filings  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and the costs involved in all aspects of intellectual property strategy and protection including the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
we expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates and we may seek to raise capital at any time we deem market conditions to be favorable 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  including governmental agencies in general and from the hhs contract specifically  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet 
table of contents arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe or off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  manufacturing and research operations and other purchase commitments 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future sublicense payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which were utilized in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include 
table of contents fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition prior to the fourth quarter of  our revenues have generally been limited to license fees  event payments  research and development fees  government contracts  and interest income 
revenue from license fees  event payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting 
revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
under our contract with hhs  revenue is recognized as reimbursable direct and indirect costs are incurred 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized revenues related to product sales of peramivir 
sales are recognized when products are shipped  title and risk of loss have passed  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we did not provide a right of product return in conjunction with the sales of peramivir during research and development expenses our research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred 
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are recognized as expense when the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
research and development expenses include  among other items  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  manufacturing costs  clinical  regulatory  and toxicology services performed by contract research organizations cros  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
most of our manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party cros 
costs for studies performed by cros are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of services actually performed 

table of contents additionally  we have license agreements with third parties  such as aecom  irl  and uab  which require fees related to sublicense agreements or maintenance fees 
we expense sublicense payments as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred  in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period 
we expense maintenance payments as incurred 
at december   we had deferred collaboration expenses of approximately million 
these deferred expenses were sub license payments  paid to our academic partners upon receipt of consideration from various commercial partners 
these deferred expenses would not have been incurred without receipt of such payments from our commercial partners and are being expensed in proportion to the related revenue being recognized 
we believe that this accounting treatment appropriately matches expenses with the associated revenue 
we group our r d expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by program 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 
the following table summarizes our r d expenses for the periods indicated amounts in millions year ended december  direct external r d expenses by program pnp inhibitor forodesine neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir pnp inhibitor bcx other all other r d expenses compensation and fringe benefits supplies and services maintenance  depreciation  and amortization overhead allocation and other direct external r d expenses by program at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of our various product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate  as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate s commercial potential 
as such  we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our product development programs in the future 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates  which drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda  or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or 
table of contents other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  as updated from time to time in our subsequent periodic reports and current reports filed with the sec 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our product development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our product development programs will commence are unavailable 
stock based compensation all share based payments  including grants of stock option awards and restricted stock awards  are recognized in our income statement based on their fair values 
stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment  including estimating the life of an award  the stock price volatility  and the expected term 
recent accounting pronouncements note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted by the company during as well as accounting pronouncements recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the objective of our investment policy is to ensure the safety and preservation of invested funds  as well as maintaining liquidity sufficient to meet cash flow requirements 
we place our excess cash with high credit quality financial institutions  commercial companies  and government agencies in order to limit the amount of credit exposure 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we do not believe that we have material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
generally  our investments are not collateralized 
we have not realized any significant losses from our investments
