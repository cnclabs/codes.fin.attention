during fiscal year  northrop and raytheon company accounted for an aggregate of of the segment s revenue 
the loss by the company of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes its relationship with these companies to be mutually satisfactory and is not aware of any prospect for the cancellation or significant reduction of any of its commercial or existing us government contracts 
the company purchases a variety of components such as transistors  resistors  capacitors  connectors and diodes for use in the manufacture of its products 
the company is not dependent upon any one supplier or source of supply for any of its component part purchases and maintains alternative sources of supply for all of its purchased components 
the company has found its suppliers generally to be reliable and price competitive 
research and development the company s technological expertise continues to be an important factor to support future growth in revenues and earnings 
the company has focused its internal research and development efforts on improving the core physics and electronic packages in its time and frequency products  conducting research to develop new time and frequency technologies  improving product manufacturability by seeking to reduce its production costs through product redesign and process improvements and other measures to take advantage of lower cost components 
the company continues to focus a significant portion of its own resources and efforts on developing hardware for satellite commercial and us government and terrestrial commercial communications systems  including wireless  wireline and gps related systems 
during fiscal years and  the company expended million and million of its own funds  respectively  on such research and development activity 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal years and  many of the company s development resources were applied to certain cost plus fee satellite payload programs 
as a result  some of the company s development efforts were customer funded and the costs appear in cost of revenues resulting in reduced internal research and development spending 
for fiscal year  the company is targeting to spend between million and million on internal research and development projects 
the actual amount spent in fiscal year will depend on market conditions and identification of new opportunities 
patents and licenses the company believes that its business is generally not dependent on patent or license protection

the company has a unique and broad product line which includes quartz  rubidium  and cesium based timing references and specialized rf microwave technology 
because of the very high precision of certain of its products  the company has few competitors 
for lower precision components there is significant competition from a number of suppliers 
in recent years  the company has successfully outsourced certain component manufacturing processes to third parties and to its wholly owned subsidiary  fei asia in tianjin  china and to russian based morion  inc  in which the company is a minority shareholder 
the company expects this outsourcing to enhance its competitive position on cost while maintaining its high quality standards 
the company believes its ability to obtain raw materials  manufacture finished products  integrate them into systems and sub systems and interface these systems with end user applications provides a strong competitive advantage 
certain of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have larger research and development and marketing staffs 
the company has a strong history of competing successfully in this environment due to the quality  reliability and outstanding record of performance its products have achieved 
with respect to its instruments and systems for timing and synchronization  the company competes with agilent technologies  symmetricom  inc  e

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements in this annual report on form k regarding future earnings and operations and other statements relating to the future constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
factors that would cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  inability to integrate operations and personnel  actions by significant customers or competitors  general domestic and international economic conditions  consumer spending trends  reliance on key customers  continued acceptance of the company s products in the marketplace  competitive factors  new products and technological changes  product prices and raw material costs  dependence upon third party vendors  competitive developments  changes in manufacturing and transportation costs  the availability of capital  and the outcome of any litigation and arbitration proceedings 
the factors listed above are not exhaustive 
other sections of this k include additional factors that could materially and adversely impact the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict the impact of all these factors on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not rely on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
any or all of the forward looking statements contained in this k and any other public statement made by the company or its management may turn out to be incorrect 
the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts which generally require billings based on achievement of milestones rather than delivery of product  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
on fixed price contracts  which are typical for commercial and us government satellite programs and other long term us government projects  and which require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs through a process of aggregating actual costs incurred and estimating additional costs to completion based upon the current available information and status of the contract 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
on production type orders  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final program costs 
changes in job performance may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on customer orders are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for customer orders in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments or smaller contracts or orders in the fei ny segment  sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon i shipment of the product or ii performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory write downs are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april  and  the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations revenues fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer less intersegment revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating profit loss other income expenses  net benefit provision for income taxes net income loss significant matters in november  tax law related to corporate net operating losses nol was changed which enabled the company to carryback the tax loss recorded in fiscal year to an earlier fiscal year 
as a consequence  the company was able to record an additional million benefit in fiscal year which offset the tax provision on current year earnings 
in the prior year  since the fiscal year operating loss followed two previous fiscal years of operating losses  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company recorded a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
this non cash change in valuation allowance was included in the company s provision for income taxes and is part of the net loss recorded in fiscal year see the section on income taxes later in this section 
revenues fiscal years ended april  in millions change fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer intersegment sales the decrease in revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  was the result of lower revenues from sales of wireless infrastructure products and other commercial products recorded in the fei ny segment 
as discussed in fiscal year  future revenues for wireless telecommunications products are uncertain as oems slow installation of new network equipment or migrate to different technologies supporting shorter independent timing capabilities or reduced quality of service which do not require the precision timing devices that the company supplies 
these lower revenues were partially offset by increased sales from the company s usg productline for the us domestic wireline market which are generated by the fei zyfer segment 
many of the usg products are produced and sold by gillam fei to fei zyfer accounting for a significant element of intersegment sales 
revenues from satellite payload programs were moderately lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues from us government space programs increased by year over year but these increases were offset by continued low levels of activity in commercial satellite space programs 
revenues from us government dod non space programs  which are recorded in the fei ny and fei zyfer segments  increased by more than year over year and accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue in fiscal year compared to in fiscal year revenues in fiscal year were less than fiscal year the decrease in revenues for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was the result of lower revenues in two of the company s major business areas  telecommunications infrastructure and satellite payloads  which declined in fiscal year by and  respectively  compared to fiscal year these revenue declines affected results primarily for the fei ny segment 
satellite payload revenue was particularly impacted in fiscal year by a decline in commercial satellite projects reflecting uncertain economic conditions which were partially offset by a rise in us government satellite revenues 
revenues for the fei zyfer segment increased in fiscal year over fiscal year due to sales of the company s new wireline telecommunication synchronization equipment 
revenues from us government dod non space customers  which are recorded in both the fei ny and fei zyfer segments  were lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  the company expects revenues from wireless telecommunication infrastructure products to remain at approximately the same levels as in fiscal year but expects revenues from its other major business areas to increase 
the company expected to be awarded contracts for certain commercial and us government satellite programs during fiscal year but the award of these contracts has been delayed 
recently  the prime contractors were awarded contracts or received funding for these programs 
since the company s products are designed into the satellites  frequency expects to be awarded significant contracts and to begin to realize revenues on these programs during fiscal year proposal activity on other satellite programs remains high 
in addition  following the end of fiscal year  the company was awarded follow on production contracts for its low g sensitivity and ruggedized rubidium products which will augment revenues in its us government dod non space business area 
the company also expects increases in revenue from wireline telecommunication products which were initially introduced to the us market in fiscal year gross margin rates fiscal years ended april  in thousands change gm rate for the year ended april   gross margin increased both in total and as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year 
the gross margin rate in fiscal year approaches the company s expected rate at current revenue levels 
during fiscal years and  cost of sales includes inventory write downs of million and million  respectively  which reduced gross margin rates by and  respectively 
a portion of the fiscal year write down and most of the fiscal year write down were related to inventory for the wireless telecommunication market for which sales were no longer expected to be realized 
in addition  during fiscal year  the company reached an agreement with a customer and received  representing a portion of the cost of certain unique inventory items that the customer no longer required and recorded this amount as a reduction to cost of goods sold during the period 
the fiscal year inventory writedowns included the unique inventory items 
during fiscal year  the company s gross margin rate was also impacted by higher levels of engineering and manufacturing costs on certain satellite payload programs that were completed during fiscal year the challenging satellite programs were completed in the first half of fiscal year and gross margin rates  exclusive of inventory write downs  began to improve in the last half of that year 
with the current mix of programs and orders in its backlog  the company expects to realize gross margin rates in the mid range during fiscal year as revenues increase in future periods  the company expects to realize a higher gross margin as more of its fixed costs are covered 
selling and administrative expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change for the fiscal year ended april   selling and administrative costs declined from fiscal year due to decreases in sales commissions and personnel costs including decreased employee benefits resulting from reductions in personnel that took place during the latter portion of fiscal year such decreases were partially offset by higher incentive compensation expense as a result of the company s improved profitability 
for the years ended april  and  selling and administrative expenses include stock compensation expense of  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended april  selling and administrative costs declined from fiscal year principally as a result of decreased personnel costs including reduced incentive compensation  lower deferred compensation expense and decreased employee benefits due to a reduction of personnel 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company targets selling and administrative expenses at of consolidated sales 
for fiscal year  the company expects to incur selling and administrative expenses at approximately the same rate as fiscal year research and development expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change research and development expenditures represent investments intended to keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future sales 
during the fiscal year ended april   r d spending increased in comparison to fiscal year this increase was the result of the company s added emphasis on the development of new space hardware including development of new c and ku band beacon telemetry transceivers and a new family of frequency generators and converters 
in addition to internal research and development spending  the company continues to apply resources to cost plus fee satellite payload programs 
the expenditures incurred on these programs are recorded in cost of revenues 
in fiscal year  research and development spending decreased in comparison to fiscal year this decrease was the result of a greater proportion of the company s development resources being applied to certain cost plus fee satellite payload programs with an aggregate contract value exceeding million 
as a consequence  as in fiscal year  some of the company s development expenditures were customer funded and the costs appeared in cost of revenues  thus reducing the level of internal research and development spending 
r d spending was and of consolidated revenues in fiscal years and  respectively  approximately in line with the company s target of of revenues for such efforts 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those products which it expects will provide the best return on investment and greatest prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal year  the company will continue to make investments in improved satellite payload products  develop and improve miniaturized rubidium atomic clocks  develop new gps based synchronization products and further enhance the capabilities of its line of low g sensitivity and ruggedized rubidium oscillators 
the company will also be engaged in development efforts that are funded by its customers  the results of which will enhance its own product offerings 
thus  the company s target for fiscal year is to spend approximately of revenues on research and development activities  although the actual level of spending is dependent on new opportunites and the rate at which it succeeds in bringing new products to market 
internally generated cash and cash reserves will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
operating profit loss fiscal years ended april  in thousands change nm nm not meaningful substantially improved gross margin rates and lower operating expenses in fiscal year enabled the company to record an operating profit for the year 
as discussed above  the operating loss incurred in fiscal year includes higher than anticipated engineering and manufacturing costs on certain satellite payload products and programs that were completed during that year as well as the million write down of wireless telecommunications inventory as compared to million in inventory writedowns in fiscal year based on recently received low g sensitivity and ruggedized rubidium product contracts  expected new bookings for satellite programs and continuing new orders for wireline telecommunication products  in fiscal year  the company expects to realize improved gross margins while maintaining other operating expenses within their targeted amounts 
thus  the company expects to report higher operating profits in the coming fiscal year 
other income expense fiscal years ended april  in thousands change investment income equity loss interest expense other expense income  net investment income includes interest and dividend income on marketable securities 
due to the low interest rate environment  fiscal year income was lower than fiscal year in addition  during fiscal year  the company recorded approximately  in losses upon the sale or redemption of certain marketable securities in its portfolio 
during fiscal year  unless interest rates begin to increase  the company anticipates that investment income will be approximately the same as that earned in fiscal year the equity loss in fiscal years and represents the company s share of the income or loss recorded by elcom in which the company owns a interest 
also  during fiscal year  based on comparisons to comparable companies as well as elcom s forecasts of future financial results  the company recorded impairment charges in the amount of  in addition to its equity share in elcom s income or loss 
in fiscal years and  interest expense was incurred on borrowings under short term credit obligations  on deferred compensation payments and a capital lease for equipment 
for the year ended april   interest expense decreased from the prior year primarily due to the pay down of its bank line of credit and the declining balance of the capital lease obligation 
the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will decrease as a result of continuing reductions in debt levels 
during the year ended april   other expense included royalty expenses  foreign exchange losses at the company s overseas subsidiaries and other non operating expenses 
during fiscal year  this category included the recognition of  of income from amortization of a deferred gain from the sale of the company s corporate headquarters building in new york 
the deferred gain was amortized over the remaining life of the original eleven year lease 
also  in fiscal year other income included realized gains of approximately  from the excess of proceeds over the cash values of life insurance policies on the life of a former officer employee 
such non operating income items were not repeated in fiscal year the company anticipates that in future years items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings 
income tax benefit provision fiscal years ended april  in thousands change nm in november  the united states enacted legislation which permits corporations to carryback net operating losses up to years versus the previous year limitation 
as a result  the company filed a claim to carryback the entire amount of its fiscal year tax loss to an earlier year and received a tax refund of approximately million 
before this legislation was enacted  the company anticipated receiving a tax benefit of approximately  and recorded a receivable on that basis 
due to the change in tax law  the company recognized a net tax benefit of million of which million is attributable to the effect of the new law 
in fiscal year  the company recorded an operating loss which  along with the challenging economic environment  reduced the likelihood that the company would be able to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
based on its cumulative losses in recent years  the company increased its valuation allowance by the amount of million during the year ended april  if in future periods the company records pre tax profits and is able to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets as more likely than not  the need for all or some of such valuation allowance could be overcome based on then available evidence 
valuation allowance reductions would reduce future income tax provisions 
as of april   the valuation allowance is approximately million 
the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates are in the united states  in europe and in china 
in fiscal year  the million tax refund created a large current benefit that offset the current tax provision and the increase in the valuation allowance 
in fiscal year  the valuation allowance created a net tax provision rather than a tax benefit from that year s tax loss 
the company utilizes the availability of research and development tax credits in the united states to lower its tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s european subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
for state income tax purposes  the company has tax loss carryforwards of approximately million in california and million in new york 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april  included in working capital at april  is million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the company s current ratio at april  is to compared to to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april   was million 
in addition to the company s return to profitability  this amount includes the million income tax refund 
during fiscal year  the company incurred million in non cash charges to earnings  including depreciation and amortization expense  the equity loss on its elcom investment  and certain employee benefit plan expenses  including accounting for stock options 
for the year ended april   the company generated million in cash from operations compared to million used in operations in fiscal year the primary source for the increased positive cash flow was the billing and collection of unbilled receivables on certain long term contracts during fiscal year such collections were partially offset by the operating loss generated by higher operating expenses 
in fiscal year  the company anticipates that it will maintain positive cash flow from operations by continuing to generate operating profits 
net cash used in investing activities was  which consists of net proceeds on the sale or redemption of marketable securities of  the repayment of a note receivable from elcom of  offset by a new note from elcom in the amount of  and the purchase of property  plant and equipment for  in fiscal year  net cash used in investing activities was million of which approximately million was derived from the net cumulative purchase of marketable securities during the year 
during the year ended april   the company acquired property  plant and equipment of  and provided a  working capital loan to elcom technologies see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company may continue to invest cash equivalents in longer term securities or to convert short term investments to cash equivalents as dictated by its investment and acquisition strategies 
the company will continue to acquire more efficient equipment to automate its production process 
the company intends to spend between million and million on capital equipment during fiscal year internally generated cash is expected to be adequate to acquire this property  plant and equipment 
the company has a million line of credit with the financial institution which also manages a substantial portion of its investment in marketable securities
