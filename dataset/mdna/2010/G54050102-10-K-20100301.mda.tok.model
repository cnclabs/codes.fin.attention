prior to the launch of this business  we registered lazard wealth management as an investment adviser with the sec 
on september   pursuant to a definitive merger agreement dated august   the company  lazard asset management llc together with its subsidiaries  lam and laz sub i  llc  a newly formed subsidiary of lazard fr res co

on july   lazard ltd acquired carnegie  wylie company holdings pty ltd cwc  an australia based financial advisory firm and concurrently sold such investment to lazard group 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to the acquisitions of gahl and cwc 
lazard and natixis entered into a cooperation arrangement in april and expanded such arrangement in march to place and underwrite securities on the french equity primary capital markets and cooperate in their respective origination  syndication and placement activities 
the arrangement expired during the third quarter of  although it continues to be applied in accordance with its general terms pending the outcome of continuing discussions 

table of contents lazard also has a long history of making alternative investments with its own capital  usually alongside capital of qualified institutional and individual investors 
at the time of lazard ltd s equity public offering and as a part of the separation  we transferred to lfcm holdings llc lfcm holdings all of our alternative investment activities  except for fonds partenaires gestion sa fpg  our private equity business in france 
such activities transferred to lfcm holdings represented the alternative investment activities of lazard alternative investments holdings llc lai and included private equity investments of corporate partners ii limited cp ii and lazard senior housing partners lp 
cp ii was managed by a subsidiary of lai until february  effective february   ownership and control of cp ii was transferred to the investment professionals who manage cp ii 
we also transferred to lfcm holdings certain principal investments by lazard group in the funds managed by the separated businesses  subject to certain options by us to reacquire such investments  while we retained our investment in our french private equity funds 
since  consistent with our obligations to lfcm holdings  we have engaged in a number of alternative investments and private equity activities 
effective september   the company sold fpg to a fund management company forming part of a group that manages investment companies and funds  in some of which lazard could earn carried interests 
the managing directors and staff conducting this activity were accordingly transferred to the buyer 
the sale of fpg did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
operating results of fpg have been included in our consolidated financial statements through the effective date of sale 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding alternative investments 
we continue to explore and discuss opportunities to expand the scope of our alternative investment and private equity activities in europe  the us and elsewhere 
these opportunities could include internal growth of new funds and direct investments by us  partnerships or strategic relationships  investments with third parties or acquisitions of existing funds or management companies 
in that regard  on july   the company established a private equity business with the edgewater funds edgewater  a chicago based private equity firm  through the acquisition of edgewater s management vehicles 
the acquisition was structured as a purchase by lazard of interests in a holding company that owns interests in the general partner and management company entities of the current edgewater private equity funds the edgewater acquisition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
also  consistent with our obligations to lfcm holdings  we may explore discrete capital markets opportunities 
for the years ended december    and  the company s consolidated net revenue was derived from the following segments year ended december financial advisory asset management corporate total business environment economic and market conditions in the us and globally have been adversely impacted since early through march by factors including the contraction in worldwide credit markets and the related tightening of lending  volatility in currency and commodity markets and oil prices and write downs within the financial sector 
global markets showed significant improvement in the last six months of overall  these economic and market conditions adversely affected our operating performance in both our financial advisory and asset management businesses in the early part of  with improvement in the second half of the year 
lazard operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for lazard s management to predict all risks and uncertainties  nor can lazard assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on its business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
see the section entitled risk factors in this form k 
furthermore  net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter 

table of contents financial advisory while m a activity for the year ended december  decreased substantially versus the corresponding prior year for both global and trans atlantic completed transactions and announced transactions  increased activity in restructuring resulted from a higher level of corporate debt defaults during according to moody s investors service  inc  in the year ended december   a total of issuers defaulted as compared to in the following table sets forth industry statistics regarding the volume of m a transactions in and year ended december  incr decr in billions completed m a transactions global trans atlantic announced m a transactions global trans atlantic source thomson financial as of january  while overall m a industry statistics regarding the number and size of announced transactions declined in as compared to  we believe that in the current environment we are relatively well positioned as our clients refinance  restructure and position their asset portfolios for growth 
nevertheless  we continue to remain cautious with respect to the overall economic environment and its impact on the m a business 
generally  during such periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions  the volume and value of m a transactions may decrease  thereby reducing the demand for our advisory services and increasing competition among financial services companies seeking such engagements 
while we believe that the number and value of corporate defaults may decrease in  we expect that our restructuring business should continue to be very active over the next several years from the significant level of corporate defaults in  as well as from advising companies during this period of volatility on matters relating to debt and financing restructuring and other on and off balance sheet assignments 
our restructuring assignments normally are executed over a six to eighteen month period 
in april  governmental officials in new york announced a new policy banning the use of placement agents by funds seeking investment contributions from the new york state and new york city public pension funds 
the use of placement agents has also been prohibited or otherwise restricted with respect to investments by public pension funds in illinois  ohio and new mexico  and similar measures are being considered in other jurisdictions and by the sec 
our private fund advisory group  which is part of our financial advisory segment  acts as placement agent for investment funds  including investment funds that have historically received capital from certain of these affected public pension funds 
we are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of these restrictions on our private fund advisory group 

table of contents asset management as shown in the table below  major global market indices at december  improved significantly as compared to such indices at december percentage change december  vs 
msci world index cac dax ftse topix msci emerging market dow jones industrial average nasdaq s p the fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of assets under management aum 
accordingly  since market appreciation depreciation and foreign currency volatility impact the level of our aum  such items will impact the level of revenues we receive from our asset management business 
since a substantial portion of our aum is invested in equities  market appreciation reflected in the changes in lazard s aum during the year ended december  generally corresponded to the changes in global market indices 
while aum at december  improved versus aum at december   our average aum during declined as compared to our average aum during  reflecting significant market depreciation during the second half of and first quarter of such decrease resulted in lower management fee revenues in financial statement overview net revenue the majority of lazard s financial advisory net revenue is earned from the successful completion of m a transactions  strategic advisory matters  restructuring and capital structure advisory services  capital raising and similar transactions 
the main driver of financial advisory net revenue is overall m a activity  the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities  particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which lazard focuses 
in some client engagements  often those involving financially distressed companies  revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction 
in addition  lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients  with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction 
lazard s financial advisory segment also earns revenue from public and private securities offerings in the form of referral fees for referring opportunities to lfcm holdings for underwriting and distribution of securities 
the referral fees received from lfcm holdings are generally one half of the revenue recorded by lfcm holdings in respect of such activities 
significant fluctuations in financial advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year 
these fluctuations arise because a significant portion of financial advisory net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction  restructuring or capital raising activity  the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to lazard s control 
lazard s asset management segment principally includes lam  lazard fr res gestion sas  fpg through its disposition on september  and  effective july   edgewater 
asset management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to institutional and private clients 
the main driver of asset management net revenue is the level of aum  which is influenced by lazard s investment performance  its ability to successfully attract and retain assets  the broader performance of the global equity markets and  to a lesser extent  fixed income markets 
as a result  fluctuations in financial markets and 
table of contents client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on asset management net revenue and operating income 
asset management fees are generally based on the level of aum measured as of the end of a quarter or month  and an increase or reduction in aum at such dates  due to market price fluctuations  currency fluctuations  net client asset flows or otherwise  will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees 
the majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of days or less 
institutional and individual clients  and firms with which we have strategic alliances  can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of aum or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market performance 
in addition  as lazard s aum includes significant assets that are denominated in currencies other than us dollars  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of lazard s aum 
fees vary with the type of assets managed  with higher fees earned on equity assets  alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity investments  and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products 
the company earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds 
for hedge funds  incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation  in some cases in excess of established benchmarks 
the company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
the performance fee measurement period is generally an annual period unless an account terminates during the year  and therefore such incentive fees are usually recorded in the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year 
these incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the funds in any year are applied against certain future period net appreciation before any incentive fees can be earned 
for private equity funds  incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold 
typically  such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole fund basis and  therefore  clawback of carried interests during the life of the fund can occur 
as a result  incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recorded until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined  including any potential for clawback 
corporate segment net revenue consists primarily of net interest income  including amounts earned at lfb  and investment gains and losses on the company s investment portfolio of lam managed equity funds and principal investments in equities  debt securities at lfb and alternative investment funds 
interest expense is also included in corporate net revenue 
corporate net revenue can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of investments classified as trading  and with respect to available for sale  when realized  or when a decline is determined to be other than temporary  with respect to available for sale and held to maturity investments  as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash  investments and indebtedness 
corporate net revenue also includes equity method investments  including  in  the write off of the company s investment in the sapphire warrants see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective july   as permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  the portion of lfb s corporate debt portfolio that had been previously designated as trading was re designated to available for sale 
during the years ended december  and  the company recorded net mark ups and mark downs of and million  respectively  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax aoci 
although corporate segment net revenue during the year ended december  represented of lazard s net revenue  total assets in corporate represented of lazard s consolidated total assets as of december   principally attributable to assets associated with lfb  and  to a lesser extent  investments in lam managed funds  other securities and cash 

table of contents operating expenses the majority of lazard s operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for employees and managing directors 
our compensation and benefits expense includes amortization of the relevant portion of the restricted stock unit awards rsus under the lazard ltd equity incentive plan plan and the lazard ltd incentive compensation plan the plan  with such amortization generally determined on a straight line basis over the vesting periods and not on the basis of revenue recognition see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

compensation expense in any given year is dependent on many factors  including general economic and market conditions  our operating and financial performance  staffing levels and competitive pay conditions  as well as the composition between current and deferred compensation 
lazard s operating expenses also include non compensation expense  amortization of intangible assets related to business acquisitions and  in  restructuring expense 
non compensation expense includes costs for occupancy and equipment  marketing and business development  technology and information services  professional services  fund administration and outsourced services  the provision benefit pursuant to a tax receivable agreement with lfcm holdings and other expenses 
amortization of intangibles related to business acquisitions are associated with the acquisitions of edgewater  gahl and cwc 
restructuring expense relates to the reduction of headcount in the first quarter of  and includes severance and related benefits expense  the acceleration of unrecognized expense pertaining to rsus previously granted to individuals who were terminated and certain other costs related to this initiative 
provision for income taxes lazard group primarily operates in the us as a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  lazard group s income pertaining to the limited liability company is not subject to us federal income taxes because taxes associated with such income represent obligations of the individual partners 
outside the us  lazard group operates principally through corporations and is subject to local income taxes 
income taxes shown on lazard s consolidated statements of operations are attributable to taxes incurred in non us entities and to new york city unincorporated business tax ubt attributable to lazard s operations apportioned to new york city

operating results as reflected in the table of consolidated results of operations above  charges related to the and special items had a significant impact on the company s reported operating results 
lazard management believes that comparisons between years are most meaningful after excluding the impact of such items 
year ended december  versus december  the company reported a net loss attributable to lazard ltd of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  as compared to net income of million in such decrease was  in part  the result of the special items  which in the aggregate served to reduce net income attributable to lazard ltd by million 
partially offsetting such items was the impact in of the special item  which reduced net income attributable to lazard ltd in that year by million 
excluding the after tax impact of the and special items  net income attributable to lazard ltd in the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  as compared to such reduction in net income attributable to lazard ltd in was primarily affected by higher amounts relating to compensation and benefits expense due to i a change in the company s compensation policy  which resulted in an increase in the cash component of compensation which is expensed currently  and a decrease in the aggregate amount of compensation amortizable over future periods  and ii an increased amount of amortization expense related to previously granted equity based incentive compensation and the current year portion of the previously awarded deferred cash incentive awards  partially offset by reductions in non compensation expense  income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the change in the company s compensation policy was designed to reduce future amortization expense associated with the equity based compensation component  to allow greater flexibility in the future to address competitive conditions  to more closely align the current pay cycle with reported compensation and revenues  and to maintain significant retention mechanisms by focusing stock grant awards at the more senior levels  where they are more highly effective and valued

table of contents net revenue trends in financial advisory for m a and strategic advisory and restructuring are generally correlated to the volume of completed industry wide m a transactions and restructurings occurring subsequent to corporate debt defaults  respectively 
however  deviations from this relationship can occur in any given year for a number of reasons 
for instance  our results can diverge from industry wide activity where there are material variances from the level of industry wide m a activity in a particular market where lazard has significant market share  or regarding the relative number of our advisory engagements with respect to larger sized transactions  and where we are involved in significant non public assignments 
certain lazard client statistics and global industry statistics are set forth below year ended december  lazard statistics number of clients total with fees greater than million percentage of total financial advisory revenue from top clients a number of m a transactions completed greater than billion b a there were no individual clients that constituted more than of our financial advisory segment net revenue in the years ended december   or b source thomson financial as of january  the geographical distribution of financial advisory net revenue is set forth below in percentage terms 
the offices that generate financial advisory net revenue are located in the us  europe principally in the uk  france  italy  spain and germany and the rest of the world principally in australia 
year ended december  united states europe rest of world total the company s managing directors and many of its professionals have significant experience  and many of them are able to use this experience to advise on m a  strategic advisory matters and restructuring transactions  depending on clients needs 
this flexibility allows lazard to better match its professionals with the counter cyclical business cycles of mergers and acquisitions and restructurings 
while lazard measures revenue by practice area  lazard does not separately measure the costs or profitability of m a services as compared to restructuring services 
accordingly  lazard measures performance in its financial advisory segment based on overall segment net revenue and operating income margins 
financial advisory results of operations as reflected in the table of operating results of the financial advisory segment above  the portion of the special item attributable to the financial advisory segment had a significant impact on the segment s reported operating results for such year 
lazard management believes that comparisons between years are most meaningful after excluding the impact of such item

table of contents corporate results of operations as reflected in the table of operating results of the corporate segment above  the and special items had a significant impact on the segment s reported operating results in such years 
lazard management believes that comparisons between years are most meaningful after excluding the impact such item 
year ended december  versus december  net interest expense in the year ended december  increased million  or  as compared to during  interest income declined million due to a lower interest rate environment  a decrease in the balance of interest earning assets at lfb as well as lower average cash balances 
average cash decreased as a result of the share repurchases of class a common stock as well as the repurchase of a portion of the company s outstanding and senior notes 
the decrease in interest income was substantially offset by lower interest expense in of million  principally as a result of the reduction in interest expense related to the company s may purchase of million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes in connection with the remarketing of such notes and by the above mentioned repurchases of senior notes  as well as a lower interest rate environment and reduced levels of lfb s customer deposits 
other revenue increased million in the year ended december   as compared to  principally due to investment income in of million in the company s investment portfolio  versus an aggregate loss of million in in lfb s corporate debt portfolio redesignated as available for sale effective july  and the company s investment portfolio 
with respect to the latter  during  the company had in place a hedging strategy to minimize its risks associated with volatility in the equity markets 
other factors contributing to the increase were revenues from various other investments of million in versus losses of million in  partially offset by i a million charge relating to the write off of the company s investment in warrants of sapphire  ii a million gain in on the repurchase of a portion of the company s senior notes and iii a million gain in from a foreign currency transaction 
operating expenses for increased million  as compared to  principally due to the special items attributable to the corporate segment 
when excluding the impact of the and special items  operating expenses increased million  or  in factors contributing to the increase were principally due to the change in the company s compensation policy described above  as well as an increase in the amortization expense associated with the current year portion of previously awarded deferred cash incentive awards  which were offset by a benefit pursuant to the tax receivable agreement and the million provision for counterparty defaults in year ended december  versus december  net interest expense in the year ended december  increased million  or  as compared to lower interest income was the principal contributing factor to the decline  due to lower average cash balances and a lower interest rate environment 
average cash decreased as a result of the share repurchases of lazard ltd s class a common stock as well as the repurchase of a portion of the company s outstanding and senior notes 
interest expense increased principally as a result of the june issuance of the aforementioned senior notes  partially offset by the reduction in interest expense related to the company s may purchase of million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes in connection with the remarketing of such notes and by the repayment of certain senior and subordinated notes in june other revenue declined million in the year ended december   as compared to  due to the extraordinary disruption and volatility in the equity and credit markets during which adversely impacted investment income 
the decline in other revenue as compared to reflects a million decrease in investment income due to losses and markdowns in the first quarter of of lfb s corporate debt portfolio held as an integral part of its asset liability management program  net unrealized losses in the company s investment portfolio  and a million write down of private equity investments primarily in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by a million gain from the repurchase of a portion of the company s senior notes

operating expenses for increased million  as compared to  including the million charge relating to the special item attributable to the corporate segment  and increases in other operating expenses in of million  or  as compared to the increase in operating expenses in was principally due to a provision of million for losses from counterparty defaults primarily relating to the bankruptcy of one of our prime brokers and in professional fees for legal expenses related to various corporate activities during decreases in compensation and benefits resulting from lower operating revenue were offset by increases in various other expense categories 
cash flows the company s cash flows are influenced by the timing of the receipt of financial advisory and asset management fees  the timing of distributions to shareholders and payments of incentive compensation to managing directors and employees 
m a  strategic advisory and asset management fees are generally collected within days of billing  while restructuring fee collections may extend beyond days  particularly those that involve bankruptcies with court ordered holdbacks 
fees from our private fund advisory activities are generally collected over a four year period from billing and typically include an interest component 
lazard group traditionally pays a significant portion of its incentive compensation during the first four months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results

included within the receivables net caption on the statements of cash flows are amounts related to lfb s short term inter bank deposits  which represent substantially all of the separately identified amount recorded as receivables net banks on the company s statements of financial condition 
the level of these inter bank deposits is primarily driven by the level of lfb customer and bank related interest bearing time and demand deposits  which can fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
as the amount of such deposits change  there is generally a corresponding  but indirect  impact on the level of short term inter bank deposits 
c principally relates to the edgewater acquisition and our equity method investment in sapphire see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  purchases and proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale and held to maturity securities and the purchase of our equity method investment in merchant bankers asociados 
d primarily includes distributions to noncontrolling interest holders  class a common stock dividends  repurchases of common membership interests from laz md holdings and shares of class a common stock and activity related to borrowings  including  in  the company s purchase of million aggregate principal amount of its senior notes in connection with the remarketing and the concurrent settlement of the purchase contract component of the equity security units esus  which resulted in lazard ltd issuing  shares of class a common stock for aggregate proceeds of million  as well as the repurchase in and of a portion of the company s outstanding and senior notes 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity and capital resources are derived from operating activities  financing agreements and equity offerings 
operating activities net revenue  operating income loss and cash receipts fluctuate significantly between quarters 
in the case of financial advisory  fee receipts are principally dependent upon the successful completion of client transactions  the occurrence and timing of which is irregular and not subject to lazard s control 
in the case of asset management  incentive fees earned on aum are generally not earned until the end of the applicable measurement period  which is generally the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year  with the respective receivable collected in the first quarter of the following year 
liquidity is significantly impacted by incentive compensation payments  a significant portion of which historically have been made during the first four months of the year 
as a consequence  cash on hand generally declines in the beginning of the year and gradually builds over the remainder of the year 
we also pay certain tax advances during the year on behalf of our managing directors  which serve to reduce their respective incentive compensation payments 
we expect this seasonal pattern of cash flow to continue 
lazard s consolidated financial statements are presented in us dollars 
many of lazard s non us subsidiaries have a functional currency ie  the currency in which operational activities are primarily conducted that is other than the us dollar  generally the currency of the country in which such subsidiaries are domiciled 
such subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the respective balance sheet date exchange rates  while revenue and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year based on the daily closing exchange rates

effect of inflation we do not believe inflation will significantly affect our compensation costs as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect certain of our other expenses  such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations by reducing aum  net revenue or otherwise 
see risk factors other business risks difficult market conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways  including by reducing the volume of transactions involving our financial advisory business and reducing the value or performance of the assets we manage in our asset management business  which  in each case  could materially reduce our revenue or income and adversely affect our financial position 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of lazard s consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  lazard evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  compensation liabilities  income taxes  investing activities and goodwill 
lazard bases these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents lazard believes that the critical accounting policies set forth below comprise the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition lazard generates substantially all of its net revenue from providing financial advisory and asset management services to clients 
lazard recognizes revenue when the following criteria are met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with a client  the agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
the company earns performance based incentive fees on various investment products  including traditional products and alternative investment funds such as hedge funds and private equity funds 
for hedge funds  incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund s net appreciation  in some cases in excess of established benchmarks 
the company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period  when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined 
the performance fee measurement period is generally an annual period unless an account terminates during the year  and therefore such incentive fees are usually recorded in the fourth quarter of lazard s fiscal year 
these incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback 
incentive fees on hedge funds generally are subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the funds in any year are applied against certain future period net appreciation before any incentive fees can be earned 
for private equity funds  incentive fees may be earned in the form of a carried interest if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold 
typically  such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole fund basis and  therefore  clawback of carried interests during the life of the fund can occur 
as a result  incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recorded until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined  including any potential for clawback 
if  in lazard s judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  lazard will not recognize revenue until the uncertainty is removed 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts to provide coverage for estimated losses from our fee and customer receivables 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on management s analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired  which may include situations where a fee is in dispute or litigation has commenced 
with respect to fees receivable from financial advisory activities  such receivables are generally deemed past due when they are outstanding days from the date of invoice 
however  some financial advisory transactions include specific contractual payment terms that may vary from one month to four years as is the case for our private fund advisory fees following the invoice date or may be subject to court approval as is the case with restructuring assignments that include bankruptcy proceedings 
in such cases  receivables are deemed past due when payment is not received by the agreed upon contractual date or the court approval date  respectively 
financial advisory fee receivables past due in excess of days are fully provided for unless there is evidence that the balance is collectible 
asset management fees are deemed past due and fully provided for when such receivables are outstanding months after the invoice date 
notwithstanding our policy for receivables past due  we specifically reserve against exposures relating to financial advisory and asset management fees where we determine receivables are impaired 

table of contents at december  and  the company had receivables past due of approximately million and million  respectively  and its allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million  respectively 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  lazard is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process requires lazard to estimate its actual current tax liability and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing book versus tax treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains or losses on investments and depreciation 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within lazard s consolidated statements of financial condition 
significant management judgment is required in determining lazard s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
at december   the company recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million  with such amount partially offset by a valuation allowance of approximately million due to the uncertainty of realizing the benefits of the book versus tax basis differences and certain net operating loss carry forwards 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized and  when necessary  valuation allowances are established 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the level of historical taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred taxes  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by the company in making this assessment 
if actual results differ from these estimates or lazard adjusts these estimates in future periods  lazard may need to adjust its valuation allowance  which could materially impact lazard s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
furthermore  management applies the more likely than not criteria prior to the recognition of a financial statement benefit of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return with respect to uncertainties in income taxes 
tax contingencies can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect lazard s overall effective tax rate 
significant management judgment is required in determining lazard s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
furthermore  lazard s interpretation of complex tax laws may impact its recognition and measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
investments investments consist principally of debt securities  equities  interests in lam alternative asset management funds and other private equity investments 
these investments are carried at either fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition  with any increases or decreases in fair value reflected i in earnings  to the extent held by our broker dealer subsidiaries or when designated as trading securities within our non broker dealer subsidiaries  and ii in aoci  to the extent designated as available for sale securities until such time they are realized and reclassified to earnings  or  if designated as held to maturity securities  amortized cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
any declines in the fair value of available for sale and held to maturity securities that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to earnings 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  effective july   as permitted under us gaap  certain debt securities held by lfb  which were previously designated as trading securities  were re designated as available for sale securities 
gains and losses on investment positions held  which arise from sales or changes in the fair value of the investments  are not predictable and can cause periodic fluctuations in net income or aoci and therefore subject lazard to market and credit risk

on january   the company adopted the required fair value measurements accounting guidance issued by the fasb  which  among other things  defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosure requirements about fair value measurements with respect to its financial assets and financial liabilities 
pursuant to such guidance  lazard categorizes its investments and certain other assets and liabilities recorded at fair value into a three level fair value hierarchy as follows level assets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that lazard has the ability to access 
level assets and liabilities whose values are based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in an active market  quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non active markets or inputs other than quoted prices that are directly observable or derived principally from or corroborated by market data 
level assets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
these inputs reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability 
items included in level include securities or other financial assets whose volume and level of activity have significantly decreased when compared with normal market activity and there is no longer sufficient frequency or volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
principally all of the company s investments in corporate bonds are considered level investments with such fair value based on observable data  principally broker quotes as provided by external pricing services 
all other debt securities at fair value are considered level investments with such fair value based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets 
the fair value of our equities is principally classified as level or level as follows marketable equity securities are classified as level and are valued based on the last trade price on the primary exchange for that security  public asset management funds are classified as level and are valued based on the reported closing price for the fund  and investments in private asset management funds are classified as level and are primarily valued based on information provided by fund managers and secondarily  from external pricing services to the extent managed by lam 

table of contents the fair value of our interests in lam alternative asset management funds is classified as level and is based on information provided by external pricing services 
the fair value of our private equity investments is classified as level and is based on financial statements provided by fund managers  appraisals and internal valuations 
where information reported is based on broker quotes  the company generally obtains one quote price per instrument 
in some cases  quotes related to corporate bonds obtained through external pricing services represent the average of several broker quotes 
where information reported is based on data received from fund managers or from external pricing services  the company reviews such information to ascertain at which level within the fair value hierarchy to classify the investment 
for additional information regarding risks associated with our investments  see risk management market and credit risks 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding investments and certain other assets and liabilities measured at fair value  including the levels of fair value within which such measurements of fair value fall 
assets under management aum managed by lam and lfg  which represents substantially all of the company s total aum  principally consist of debt and equity instruments whose value is readily available based on quoted prices on a recognized exchange or by a broker 
accordingly  significant estimates and judgments are generally not involved in the calculation of the value of our aum 
goodwill in accordance with current accounting guidance  goodwill has an indefinite life and is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in this process  lazard makes estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities and to project future earnings using various valuation techniques 
lazard s assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill 
consolidation of vies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lazard group and all other entities in which it has a controlling interest 
lazard determines whether it has a controlling interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity vie under us gaap 
voting interest entities 
voting interest entities are entities in which i the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance itself independently and ii the equity holders have the obligation to absorb losses  the right to receive residual returns and the right to make decisions about the entity s activities 
lazard is required to consolidate a voting interest entity that it maintains an ownership interest in if it holds a majority of the voting interest in such entity 
variable interest entities 
vies are entities that lack one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity 
if lazard has a variable interest  or a combination of variable interests  in a vie and it will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses  receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns  or both  it is required to consolidate such vie 

table of contents lazard is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are vies and holds variable interests in such vies 
transactions associated with these entities primarily include investment management  real estate and private equity investments 
those vies for which lazard was determined to be the primary beneficiary were consolidated in accordance with current accounting guidance 
those vies included company sponsored venture capital investment vehicles established in connection with lazard s compensation plans 
in connection with the separation  lazard group transferred its general partnership interests in those vies to a subsidiary of lfcm holdings 
lazard group has determined that it is no longer the primary beneficiary with respect to those vies and  as a result  the company no longer consolidates such vies 
risk management the company encounters risk in the normal course of business and therefore we have designed risk management processes to help manage and monitor such risks considering both the nature of our business and our operating model 
the company is subject to varying degrees of credit  market  operational and liquidity risks see liquidity and capital resources and monitors these risks at both an entity and on a consolidated basis 
management within each of lazard s operating locations are principally responsible for managing the risks within its respective businesses on a day to day basis 
market and credit risks lazard is subject to credit and market risks and therefore has established procedures to assess such risks  as well as specific interest rate and currency risk  and has established limits related to various positions 
market and or credit risks related to investments are discussed under investments above 
lazard enters into interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge exposures to interest rates and currency exchange rates and uses equity swap contracts to hedge a portion of its market exposure with respect to certain equity investments 
at december  and  derivative contracts related primarily to interest rate swaps  equity and foreign currency exchange rate contracts  and are recorded at fair value 
derivative assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively  with derivative liabilities amounting to million and million  at such respective dates 
the decrease in derivative liabilities at december  as compared to december  related principally to the company s foreign currency exchange contracts 
with respect to lfb s operations  lfb engages in commercial banking activities that primarily include investing in securities  deposit taking and  to a lesser degree  lending 
in addition  lfb may take open foreign exchange positions with a view to profit  but does not sell foreign exchange options in this context  and enters into interest rate swaps  forward foreign exchange contracts and other derivative contracts to hedge exposures to interest rate and currency fluctuations 
the primary market risks associated with lfb s securities portfolio  foreign currency exchange hedging and lending activities are sensitivity to changes in the general level of credit spreads and interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
the risk management strategies that we employ use various risk sensitivity metrics to measure such risks and to examine behavior under significant adverse market conditions  such as those we are currently experiencing 
the following sensitivity metrics provide the resultant effects on the company s operating income for the year ended december  lfb s credit spread risk  as measured by a basis point change in credit spreads totaled million and million  respectively 
lfb s interest rate risk as measured by a basis point change in interest rates totaled thousand 
foreign currency risk associated with lfb s open positions  in the aggregate  as measured by a basis point change against the us dollar  totaled approximately thousand 

table of contents lfb fully secures its collateralized financing transactions with fixed income securities 
risks related to receivables we maintain an allowance for bad debts to provide coverage for probable losses from our fee and customer receivables 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance by estimating the probability of loss based on management s analysis of the client s creditworthiness and specifically reserve against exposures where we determine the receivables are impaired 
at december   total receivables amounted to million  net of an allowance for bad debts of million 
as of that date  inter bank deposits  financial advisory and asset management fees  customer and related party receivables comprised   and of total receivables  respectively 
at december   total receivables amounted to million  net of an allowance for bad debts of million 
as of that date  inter bank deposits  financial advisory and asset management fee  customer and related party receivables comprised   and of total receivables  respectively 
the company recorded bad debt expense of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
see also revenue recognition above and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding receivables 
receivables from banks represent those related to lfb s short term inter bank deposits 
the level of these inter bank deposits is primarily driven by the level of lfb customer and bank related interest bearing time and demand deposits  which can fluctuate significantly on a daily basis 
as the amount of such deposits held at lfb changes  there is generally a corresponding  but indirect  impact on the level of short term inter bank deposits 
while historically the risk of loss associated with such inter bank deposits was extremely low  with the unprecedented disruption and volatility in the financial markets during  a number of financial institutions disclosed liquidity and credit quality issues 
lfb executes such deposit agreements with leading french financial institutions and the company closely monitors the creditworthiness of such counterparties to minimize its exposure to loss in such market conditions 
based on its review of its receivables from banks at december  and  lfb has determined that an allowance for doubtful accounts related to such receivables from banks was not required 
credit concentration to reduce the exposure to concentrations of credit from banking activities within lfb  the company has established limits for corporate counterparties and monitors the exposure against such limits 
at december   lfb had no exposure to an individual counterparty that exceeded million with such amount being fully collateralized  excluding deposits with inter bank counterparties 
with respect to activities outside lfb  as of december   the company s largest individual counterparty exposure was a financial advisory related fee receivable of million 
risks related to short term investments and corporate indebtedness a significant portion of the company s liabilities has fixed interest rates  while its cash and short term investments generally have floating interest rates 
based on account balances as of december   lazard estimates that operating income relating to cash and short term investments and corporate indebtedness would change by approximately million  on an annual basis  in the event interest rates were to increase or decrease by 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
approximately of this was invested in short term interest earning accounts at a number of leading banks throughout the world  or short term certificates of deposit from such banks 
the remaining cash and cash equivalents were invested in highly liquid institutional money market funds  a significant majority of which were invested solely in us government or agency securities  or in institutional money market funds that have announced that they 
table of contents are participating in the us treasury department s temporary guarantee program for money market funds 
on a regular basis  management reviews and updates its list of approved depositor banks as well as deposit and investment thresholds 
operational risks operational risk is inherent in all our business and may  for example  manifest itself in the form of errors  breaches in the system of internal controls  business interruptions  fraud or legal actions due to operating deficiencies or noncompliance 
the company maintains a framework including policies and a system of internal controls designed to monitor and manage operational risk and provide management with timely and accurate information 
management within each of the operating companies is primarily responsible for its operational risk programs 
the company has in place business continuity and disaster recovery programs that manage its capabilities to provide services in the case of a disruption 
we purchase insurance programs designed to protect the company against accidental loss and losses  which may significantly affect our financial objectives  personnel  property  or our ability to continue to meet our responsibilities to our various stakeholder groups
