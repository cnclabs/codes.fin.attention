our store development program has historically focused on adding new stores within existing markets where we can achieve a larger presence  remodeling or relocating existing stores and entering new markets 
the addition of new stores  along with strategic acquisitions  has played a significant role in our growth and success 
we believe the opening of new stores  and their strategic location in relation to our diy and commercial customers  will continue to play a significant role in our future growth and success 
we open and operate stores profitably in both large  densely populated markets and small  less densely populated areas that would not otherwise support a national chain selling primarily to the retail automotive aftermarket 
we complete substantial research prior to entering a new market 
key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population  demographics  vehicle profile  number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate

store technology 
our store based information systems  which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service  are comprised of a proprietary pos system and electronic parts catalog  or epc  system 
information maintained by our pos system is used to formulate pricing  marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly 
our pos system is fully integrated with our epc system and enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year  make  model and engine type of their vehicles 
our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to i exchange data with our vendors and ii catalog and deliver updated  accurate parts information 
our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and user friendly navigation tools that enhance our team members ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair project 
if a hard to find part or accessory is not available at one of our stores  the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and in stock through our pdq system 
available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store  pdq or master pdq with immediate confirmation of price  availability and estimated delivery time 
we also support our store operations with additional proprietary systems 
our store level inventory management system provides real time inventory tracking at the store level

store support center merchandising 
purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in three primary locations store support center in roanoke  virginia  regional office in minneapolis  minnesota  and global sourcing office in taipei  taiwan beginning in our roanoke team is primarily responsible for the parts categories and our minnesota team is primarily responsible for accessories  oil and chemicals 
our global sourcing team works closely with both teams 
in fiscal  we purchased merchandise from approximately vendors  with no single vendor accounting for more than of purchases 
our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with most of our vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms  including pricing  payment terms and volume 
the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and  in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners  utilizes a category management process 
the merchandising team continues to refine its category management process and has recently implemented the first phase of a category management system which consists of a multi phase implementation of an oracle system solution 
we believe this process  which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category  and our global sourcing operation are critical to improving comparable store sales  gross margin and inventory turns 
our merchandising strategy  which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers  is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as bosch  castrol  sylvania  prestone  monroe  wagner  purolator  dayco  trico and federal mogul moog  or moog 
in addition to these branded products  we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers 
these lines of merchandise include everything from chemical and wash and wax products to tools  batteries  parts and interior automotive accessories under various private label names such as wearever and autocraft 
supply chain 
our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a supply chain network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses and stores 
our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center  pdq warehouse and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs 
our replenishment system utilizes the most up to date information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history  sales trends by sku  seasonality and weather patterns and demographic shifts in demand 
our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders 
a significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by computer generated e mail or facsimile 
our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system to efficiently manage incoming shipments to our distribution centers and from our distribution centers to our stores 
benefits from this system include i reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs  ii visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire 
table of contents supply chain  iii a reduction in distribution center inventory  or safety stock  due to consistent transit times  iv decreased third party freight and billing service costs  v decreased distribution center to store freight costs and vi higher store in stock position 
we utilize two reputable dedicated carriers to ship product from our distribution centers to our stores 
we currently operate eight distribution centers 
all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system  or dcms 
our dcms provides real time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving  picking  shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers 
the dcms  integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment  significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs  while improving efficiency 
this equipment includes carousels  pick to light systems  radio frequency technology  voice technology and automated sorting systems 
through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives such as engineered standards in our distribution centers  we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity 
we believe our current supply chain network  including a new distribution projected to open in indiana in  provides ample capacity for our projected growth in the foreseeable future 
we currently offer approximately  skus to support all of our retail stores via our stand alone pdq warehouses and or our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq items 
stores have system visibility to inventory in their respective pdq warehouses and distribution centers and can place orders to these facilities  or as an alternative  through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities 
ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq trucking fleet and third party carriers 
store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers 
in addition  we operate a master pdq warehouse that stocks approximately  incremental skus of harder to find automotive parts and accessories and utilizes our existing pdq distribution infrastructure and or third party arrangements to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores 
marketing advertising 
we have an extensive marketing and advertising program designed to communicate our ability to meet consumers needs through our merchandise offerings  parts assortment and availability  competitive prices  free services and commitment to customer service 
our marketing and advertising program is focused on establishing advance auto parts as the primary resource for a customer s automotive needs 
we reinforce our brand image through a mix of media that includes television  radio  promotional signage  outdoor media  print  on line advertising and our internet site 
our marketing and advertising plan is a brand building program primarily built around television  direct marketing  radio advertising  and local marketing 
the plan is supported by in store signage  on line advertising and print 
our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and entertainment programming

we use spanish language radio and television advertising to market to our hispanic customers 
our advertising program is also supported through a new title sponsorship program for monster jam  a live family oriented motorsports event tour and television show highlighted by the racing and freestyle competition of monster trucks  and sponsorships of sporting events  racing teams and other grass root level events intended to positively impact individual communities  including hispanic and other ethnic communities  to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores 
since  we have used an integrated consumer education program to build our image as not only the best source for parts  but also the best resource for vehicle information 
our goal with our consumer education initiative is to continue our long term brand building success  increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base 
we continue to support our branding campaign  keep the wheels turning

the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring  positive image of advance auto parts with our targeted customers 

table of contents ai segment ai s business primarily serves the commercial market  with an emphasis on parts for imported cars  from its store locations located primarily throughout the northeast and mid atlantic regions 
in addition  its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts  unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery 
as a result of its extensive sourcing network  ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts 
the vast majority of ai s product is sold under its own proprietary brand 
the ai stores offer approximately  skus with access to an additional  unique skus through its supply chain network 
ai has significantly increased its store count since our acquisition of ai in september at january   we operated stores under the autopart international trade name in the following states location number of stores location number of stores location number of stores connecticut massachusetts pennsylvania delaware new hampshire rhode island florida new jersey vermont maine new york virginia maryland the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores of the new stores in  stores were acquired in september as part of our ai acquisition 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 
team members at february   we employed approximately  full time team members and approximately  part time team members 
our workforce consisted of of our team members employed in store level operations  employed in distribution and employed in our corporate offices 
we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our team member relations are good 
intellectual property we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks  including advance auto parts  western auto  parts america  autopart international and pdq for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered a number of 
table of contents trademarks for our proprietary products 
we believe that these trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy 
we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks  and we actively defend and enforce them 
competition we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry 
our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores  including autozone  inc  o reilly automotive  inc 
and the pep boys manny  moe jack  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  including those associated with national parts distributors or associations  such as napa and carquest  iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that  like us  have multiple locations in one or more markets  have competitive advantages in customer service  marketing  inventory selection  purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
the principal methods of competition in our business include store location  product offerings  availability  quality  price and customer service 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing recycling of automotive lead acid batteries and used automotive oil  and ownership and operation of real property 
we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business 
in addition  our customers may bring automotive lead acid batteries or used automotive oil onto our properties 
we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used lead acid batteries and used oil at substantially all of our stores as a service to our customers 
pursuant to agreements with third party vendors  lead acid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members  deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal 
the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
persons who arrange for the removal  disposal  treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal  treatment or other site affected by such substances 
based on our experience  we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting lead acid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third parties 
we own and lease real property 
under various environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances 
from time to time  we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own  lease or operate or may have owned  leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
our business is subject to a variety of risks  both known and unknown 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the following risk factors 
these risks are not the only risks that may impact our business 
deterioration in general macro economic conditions  including unemployment  inflation or deflation  consumer debt levels  high fuel and energy costs  uncertain credit markets or other recessionary type conditions could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
deterioration in general macro economic conditions impacts us through i higher operating costs from higher energy prices  ii potential adverse effects from deteriorating and uncertain credit markets and iii the negative impact on our suppliers and customers 
impact of credit market uncertainty our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by deteriorating and uncertain credit markets 
the interest rates on our credit facilities are linked directly to our credit ratings 
accordingly  any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense we pay on borrowed funds 
additionally  we may be limited in our ability to borrow additional funds to finance our operations 
it is possible that one or more of the banks that provides us with financing under our credit facilities may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facilities or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 
an inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost effective rates could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
impact on our suppliers our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our suppliers and on our suppliers ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms 
many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these suppliers to sell us products on favorable terms 
one such factor is a general decline in the economy and economic conditions and prolonged recessionary conditions 
these events could negatively affect our suppliers operations and make it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the short term or long term and meet our product requirements 
financial or operational difficulties that some of our suppliers may face could also increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them 
we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some suppliers  and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices 
we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience bankruptcies  work stoppages  labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 
impact on our customers deterioration in macro economic conditions may have a negative impact on our customers net worth  financial resources and disposable income 
this impact could reduce their willingness or ability to pay for accessories  maintenance or repair of their vehicles  which results in lower sales in our stores 
higher fuel costs may also reduce the overall number of miles driven by our customers resulting in less parts failures and elective maintenance required to be completed 
if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 
overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons  including 
table of contents the economy  because during periods of declining economic conditions  as mentioned above  both diy and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  conversely  during periods of favorable economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new cars  changing weather patterns along with increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions  as elective vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of unfavorable weather  the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven  because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturer s dealer network using dealer parts  and lower vehicle mileage decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need  the quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that have low part failure rates will require less frequent repairs using aftermarket parts  and the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic  repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our diy and commercial customers require to diagnose  repair and maintain their vehicles  because this may force consumers to have all diagnostic work  repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network 
if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers  our revenues may decline  and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways  including name recognition  location  price  quality  product availability and customer service 
we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry  primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts 
these competitors and the level of competition vary by market 
some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share  including a greater amount of marketing activities  a larger number of stores  store locations  store layouts  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger and more established customer bases  lower prices  and better product warranties 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending  which would lower our revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines  require us to discontinue current product offerings  or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources or expertise  or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we may lose customers  our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
we depend on the services of many qualified team members  whom we may not be able to attract and retain 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members 
at february   we employed approximately  team members 
we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future 
our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package 
if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package  our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy  including four key strategies introduced in  to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively  or if these initiatives are unsuccessful  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
in addition to the aforementioned risk factors  adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending  our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner  our ability to maintain and eventually grow diy market share  and our ability to continue our commercial sales growth at a more rapid pace than diy and attain a diy and commercial sales mix 
we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful  including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings or the successful integration of any acquired businesses  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
new store openings we have increased our store count significantly from stores at the end of fiscal to  stores at january  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions 
we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things the availability of potential store locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations  the availability of financial resources  including access to capital at cost effective interest rates  and our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates 
we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis  or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 
acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances we may acquire stores or businesses from  make investments in  or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence 
any future acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks  including but not limited to the difficulty of identifying appropriate strategic partners or acquisition candidates  securing adequate financing on cost effective terms for acquisition or post acquisition expenditures  the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management s attention  the inability or failure to discover liabilities prior to completion of an acquisition  including the assumption of legal liabilities  the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities to realize anticipated economic  operational or other favorable benefits  
table of contents the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the inability or failure to retain key personnel from the acquired business  and the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management 
we are unsure whether we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with any acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts 
if we fail to successfully open and operate new stores or make strategic acquisitions or alliances  then our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 
because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation involving claims related to  among other things  breach of contract  tortious conduct  employment discrimination  payment of wages  asbestos exposure  real estate  and product defects 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim  this could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection  product quality standards  building and zoning requirements  as well as employment law matters 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions  while incurring substantial legal fees and costs 
in addition  our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 
we may be affected by global climate change or by legal  regulatory  or market responses to such change 
the growing political and scientific sentiment is that global weather patterns are being influenced by increased levels of greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere 
this growing sentiment and the concern over climate change have led to legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
for example  proposals that would impose mandatory requirements on greenhouse gas emissions continue to be considered by policy makers in the united states 
laws enacted that directly or indirectly affect our suppliers through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products or our business through an impact on our inventory availability  cost of sales  operations or demand for the products we sell could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
significant increases in fuel economy requirements or new federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles  annual miles driven or the products we sell or lead to changes in automotive technology 
compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws  could require additional expenditures by us or our suppliers 
our inability to respond to changes in automotive technology could adversely impact the demand for our products and our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
war or acts of terrorism  or the threat of either  may negatively impact the availability and cost of merchandise and our customers and adversely impact our sales and profitability 
war or acts of terrorism  or the threat of either  may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores 
some of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 
furthermore  terrorist attacks  war in the middle east  or war within or between any oil producing country

table of contents introduction we are a leading specialty retailer of automotive aftermarket parts  accessories  batteries and maintenance items primarily operating within the united states 
our stores carry an extensive product line for cars  vans  sport utility vehicles and light trucks 
we serve both diy and commercial customers 
at january   we operated  stores throughout states  puerto rico and the virgin islands 
we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts  or aap  and autopart international  or ai 
the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the united states  puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names advance auto parts  advance discount auto parts and western auto 
at january   we operated  stores in the aap segment  of which  stores operated under the trade names advance auto parts and advance discount auto parts throughout states in the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
these stores offer automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items 
in addition  we operated stores under the western auto and advance auto parts trade names  located in puerto rico and the virgin islands  or offshore 
at january   we operated stores in the ai segment under the autopart international trade name 
we acquired ai in september ai operates as an independent  wholly owned subsidiary 
ai s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations located primarily in the northeast and mid atlantic regions 
in addition  its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
management overview during fiscal  we produced favorable financial results primarily due to top line sales growth and strong gross profit improvement resulting in earnings per diluted share  or eps  of compared to in fiscal although we have presented our financial results in this form k in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  our financial results for fiscal and fiscal include the impact of the following significant items 
our fiscal results were reduced by an eps impact of resulting from the closure of stores in connection with our store divestiture plan 
our fiscal financial results included an extra week of operations rd week as well as a non cash obsolete inventory write down of million due to a change in inventory management approach for slow moving inventory  or non cash inventory adjustment 
the impact of the fiscal items was a net reduction in eps of 
we generated significant operating cash flow in fiscal that allowed us to invest in business initiatives related to our four key strategies  repay a significant portion of our bank debt and repurchase shares of our common stock 
fiscal highlights highlights from our fiscal include financial total sales for fiscal increased over fiscal to billion 
excluding the impact of the rd week in fiscal  our total sales increased 
this growth was primarily due to a comparable store sales increase of and sales from the net addition of total stores opened within the last year 
our gross profit rate increased basis points as compared to fiscal approximately basis points of this increase is related to the non cash inventory adjustment of million in fiscal our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  rate increased basis points as compared to fiscal partially due to basis points of store divestiture expenses 
excluding store divestitures  this increase in sg a is primarily linked to the targeted investments we are making to support each of our four key strategies which have already begun to yield benefits in our sales and gross profit results 
we generated operating cash flow of million for the year  an increase of million over fiscal  and used available operating cash to pay down million of outstanding bank debt and 
table of contents repurchase million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
general our continuous improvements in customer satisfaction and team member engagement scores  renewed focus on core values and ongoing initiatives within each of our four key strategies commercial acceleration  diy transformation  availability excellence and superior experience were equally important in driving our favorable financial results for the year 
we began our global sourcing operation in taiwan which we expect will provide gross profit improvements and allow us to more quickly source products that our customers want and need 
we launched our new aap e commerce website  which offers our customers online shopping and access to over  parts and accessories 
we continued to make progress towards our goal of obtaining investment grade credit ratings based on our increased profitability and cash flow and strength of our balance sheet 
key strategies fiscal marked the end of the turnaround phase of our strategic plan 
we made significant investments in each of our four key strategies with the ultimate focus on the customer and growth in our business 
our principal focus during this turnaround phase has been on commercial acceleration and availability excellence to accelerate our growth and profitability 
we have made strategic choices to fund investments in each of these strategies and will continue to balance our investments between commercial and diy over the long term 
as we transition from our turnaround phase to a transformation phase  we expect to increase our focus on customer facing capabilities to ensure our customers have a superior experience with us 
commercial acceleration our commercial comparable store sales increase was during fiscal our commercial sales  as a percentage of total sales  increased basis points to for fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe our consistent growth in commercial sales and market share is being driven in part by the investments we have made over the last year and continue to make under our commercial acceleration strategy 
as of the end of fiscal  we have made substantial investments in parts  key brands  and additional parts professionals  delivery trucks and drivers in approximately one third of our stores 
we have also increased our commercial sales force by approximately from the beginning of fiscal we continue to make progress in redefining and realigning the roles and responsibilities of our operational teams in preparation for the continued growth in commercial at a faster pace than diy 
we plan to eventually generate closer to a mix of commercial and diy sales as a result of the highly fragmented commercial market 
our current market share is less than of the billion commercial market 
diy transformation our fiscal diy comparable store sales increase of marks our first positive increase for a full fiscal year since fiscal the overall growth in diy sales during fiscal was impacted by the acceleration of store closings  the deceleration of new store openings  reduced marketing spend in the second and third quarters  and the absence of an e commerce platform 
the industry continues to benefit from increased customer traffic as consumers are saving money by maintaining their existing vehicles rather than replacing them and miles driven have started to increase again 
although industry data reported by the npd group indicates the market grew slightly faster than we did during fiscal  we believe we can maintain and eventually increase diy market share based on our recently revamped marketing programs and other initiatives underway in our diy transformation 
we have initiatives underway to address both the conversion rate of our existing customers as well as the consideration rate of potential customers 
conversion rate initiatives include the installation of traffic counters and updated phone systems to provide valuable information about the customer experience  improved staffing and 
table of contents targeting certain stores with specific research and sales development efforts to help us better solve our customers problems and leverage the parts availability and merchandising improvements we are making in our stores 
regarding consideration rate  we have made significant changes to our marketing program during the second half of the year which includes a more targeted approach to attract our highest potential customers 
we established a title sponsorship with monster jam  a live family oriented motorsports event tour and television show highlighted by the racing and freestyle competition of monster trucks 
the monster jam tour destinations align closely with our store footprint 
availability excellence our availability excellence strategy represents our commitment to enhance the breadth and depth of our parts availability in our stores and improve the speed of our parts delivery  in order to help us better serve both our commercial and diy customers 
in addition to our positive sales results  we believe our ongoing investments and initiatives under this strategy are driving our strong gross profit results 
our gross profit for fiscal increased basis points compared to fiscal  excluding the non cash inventory adjustment and impact of the rd week in fiscal during fiscal  we made significant progress in capabilities to help drive our sales and gross profit growth  including the continued improvement in parts availability  the strengthening and development of a price optimization capability and implementation of the first phase of our core merchandising system 
we also added six net pdq facilities and larger stores which stock a wider selection and greater supply of inventory  or hub stores  to our supply chain network and completed the implementation of engineered standards in all eight of our distribution centers to improve productivity  increase efficiency and ultimately reduce distribution expenses 
we disposed of substantially all of the nonproductive inventory we identified in fiscal by the end of fiscal we continue to manage our inventory productivity by removing unproductive inventory from our store assortments through utilizing markdown strategies and our vendor return privileges 
we expect to manage more effectively the growth in our inventory as compared to our sales growth 
superior experience superior experience is centered around our store operations and providing superior customer service 
the successful rollout and completion of commercial and diy initiatives in our stores is greatly dependent on the superior experience strategy 
the feedback from our customer satisfaction surveys  coupled with our team member engagement surveys  provides the evidence of our continued focus and commitment to understand what our customers need and how to engage our team members to fulfill that goal 
we have a dedicated team of field operations leaders who are leading the rollout of initiatives over our entire store chain in a very disciplined and focused way 
these initiatives include improving staffing  structuring operations to more effectively serve both commercial and diy customers  providing sales development and coaching and driving gross profit improvements through new battery warranty procedures  better pricing decisions and improved shrink control 
store divestiture plan for fiscal  we divested a total of stores that were delivering strategically or financially unacceptable results 
these closures were in addition to stores that we closed as part of our routine review and closure of underperforming stores at or near the end of their respective lease terms 
during fiscal  we recognized expenses of million related to our store divestiture plan 
the majority of this expense was related to the estimated remaining lease obligations at the time of the closures 
as of january   we had completed our store divestiture plan 
our total store closures for fiscal are estimated at to change in accounting principle we have retrospectively adjusted all comparable periods related to cost of sales and sg a as a result of a change in accounting principle effective january  we changed our accounting for freight and other handling costs associated with transferring merchandise from our hub stores and pdq facilities to our retail stores from recording such costs as sg a to recording such costs in cost of sales 
this change  which had no impact to operating income or cash flows  more accurately reflects the nature of the expense 

table of contents the net adjustment increasing cost of sales and decreasing sg a was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
for additional information regarding this change  see note  change in accounting principle  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
industry challenging macroeconomic conditions continue with the unemployment rate at  the highest in over years  and consumer confidence remaining low 
financial results from the leading automotive aftermarket companies suggest that the entire industry is benefiting from the economic downturn because consumers are keeping their vehicles longer  which in turn increases the average age of vehicles and the need to repair and complete routine maintenance on those vehicles 
recent statistics indicate miles driven have increased three straight quarters reversing a negative trend throughout and early in addition  gas prices remain well under the historic highs experienced throughout most of and the average vehicle age continues to rise and is slightly over years 
in summary  the economic environment continues to present mixed results to our industry with opportunities to serve customers in need of parts and other required maintenance but other elective maintenance and accessory purchases being deferred until disposable income returns to higher levels 
we believe we can maintain market share and eventually increase our market share in the less fragmented diy market 
we also believe we will continue to significantly increase our market share in the commercial market where our current market share is less than of the billion commercial market 
we are pleased with our fiscal financial results 
we remain committed to making the necessary investments to help ensure our long term profitability and the success of our transformation as we strive to become the industry leader 
store development by segment the following table sets forth the total number of new  closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal  and we lease approximately of our stores 
aap fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores closed stores number of stores  end of period relocated stores stores with commercial delivery programs ai fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores closed stores number of stores  end of period relocated stores stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal  we anticipate adding approximately aap and ai stores and closing to total stores 

table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 
vendor incentives we receive incentives in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional considerations 
many of these incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis or less short term 
both cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory 
these deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold since these payments do not represent reimbursements for specific  incremental and identifiable costs 
total deferred vendor incentives included in inventory was million at january  similarly  we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
however  these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement 
our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates  however  the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same 
short term incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the duration of any short term agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables  net except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets  net 
inventory reserves our inventory reserves consist of reserves for projected losses related to shrink and for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
an increase or decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase or decrease to our cost of sales 
shrink may occur due to theft  loss or inaccurate records for the receipt of merchandise  among other things 
we establish reserves for estimated store shrink based on results of completed independent physical inventories  results from recent cycle counts and historical and current loss trends 
we perform cycle counts in the distribution facilities throughout the year to measure actual shrink and to estimate reserve requirements 
if estimates of our shrink reserves are inaccurate based on the inventory counts  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we establish reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels  ii the historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions 
we also provide reserves when less than full credit is expected from a vendor or when liquidating product will result in retail prices below recorded costs 
at the end of fiscal  we reviewed our inventory productivity and changed our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory 
as a result  we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories by million  excluding a lifo and warehousing cost impact of million 
this non cash expense was presented as an increase to cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of operations 
with this change in inventory management approach  we intend to more effectively manage slow moving inventory and continue to utilize vendor 
table of contents return privileges when necessary 
our total inventory reserves decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily related to the entire utilization of our reserve for slow moving inventory established in fiscal in connection with the change in approach for slow moving inventory 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory  changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory or failure by us to effectively manage the lifecycle of our inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
a difference in actual inventory reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january warranty reserves we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from days to lifetime warranties  the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer s warranty is borne by our vendors 
however  we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer 
merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks 
we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on the historical return experience of the respective product sold 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
to the extent vendors provide upfront allowances in lieu of accepting the obligation for warranty claims and the allowance is in excess of the related warranty expense  the excess is recorded as a reduction to cost of sales 
a change in the warranty reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  self insurance reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
our self insurance program started in our self insurance reserves for fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
each year  our reserve for self insurance increases over the prior year because each year adds an additional layer of reserves without an equal amount of prior year reserves being fully relieved 
generally  claims have historically taken several years to settle and thus are not relieved at the same rate as additional reserves are added each year 
we have experienced an increase in overall claims during the last three years which is generally reflective of our overall growth  including an increase in total stores  team members and commercial delivery vehicles 
while we have seen the severity and frequency of worker s compensation and general liability claims moderate  the severity and frequency of automobile liability claims have increased primarily due to the significant increase in the number of our commercial delivery vehicles 
our reserve for claims filed  claims incurred but not yet reported  projected future claims using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding sg a could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment annually during our fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset may not be recoverable 
we complete our impairment evaluation by combining information from our internal valuation analyses by reporting units  considering other publicly available market information and using an 
table of contents independent valuation firm 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions as a marketplace participant would and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies of our company and our reporting units 
these assumptions and estimates are a major component of the derived fair value of our reporting units 
the margin of calculated fair value over the respective carrying value of our reporting units may not be indicative of the total company due to differences in the individual reporting units  including but not limited to size and projected growth 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to assess impairment loss during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
a change in our total goodwill and intangible assets outstanding at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  tax reserves the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax law  codes  regulations  pronouncements and court cases for the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business 
our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions 
these examinations include  among other things  auditing our filing positions  the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions 
at any particular time  multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
in evaluating our income tax positions  we record a reserve when a tax benefit cannot be recognized and measured in accordance with the authoritative guidance on uncertain tax positions 
these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change 
those developments could be  but are not limited to settlement of tax audits  expiration of the statute of limitations  the evolution of tax law  codes  regulations and court cases  along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 
these tax reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution 
a change in the tax reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers 
our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods approximately one year 
we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
beginning in fiscal  we began including in comparable store sales the net sales from the offshore and ai stores 
the comparable periods have been adjusted accordingly 
fiscal comparable store sales exclude the effect of the rd week 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage  defective merchandise and warranty costs  and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of

we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements  without minimum purchase volume requirements  when we believe it is advantageous

store divestiture expenses comprised basis points of the increase in sg a as a percentage of net sales 
the remaining increase was primarily due to increased investments in store labor and commercial sales force  higher incentive compensation driven by the favorable financial results in fiscal  and continued investments to improve our gross profit rate and to operate our new e commerce operation 
these increases were partially offset by lower advertising expenses and occupancy expense leverage 
excluding store divestitures  this increase in sg a is primarily linked to the targeted investments we are making to support each of our four key strategies which have already begun to yield benefits in our sales and gross profit results 
while our transformation will require continued investments in areas such as commercial  e commerce and global sourcing  management plans to balance increases in fixed and variable sg a relative to our sales growth

gross profit for fiscal reflects a reduction of million  or basis points resulting from a non cash inventory adjustment 
offsetting this reduction in gross profit as a percentage of net sales were improvements in gross profit from more effective pricing  decreased inventory shrink  and higher sales from ai  which generated a higher gross profit rate

refer to footnote of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this adoption 
liquidity and capital resources overview of liquidity our primary cash requirements to maintain our current operations include payroll and benefits  the purchase of inventory  contractual obligations and capital expenditures as well as the payment of quarterly cash dividends and estimated income taxes 
in addition  we have used available funds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and periodically repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed 
we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations  available cash and cash equivalents  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 

table of contents at january   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million compared to january  the end of fiscal 
this increase resulted from additional cash flows from operating activities including higher net income  slower growth in inventory  net of our accounts payable ratio  and increase in deferred income taxes and a decrease in repurchases of our common stock partially offset by an increase in the net repayment of debt 
additional discussion of our cash flow results is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section 
at january   our outstanding indebtedness was million lower when compared to january  and consisted of borrowings of million under our term loan  million outstanding on an economic development note and million outstanding under other financing arrangements 
additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced our total availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
the letters of credit serve as collateral for our self insurance policies and routine purchases of imported merchandise 
we have lenders participating in our revolving credit facility  each with a commitment of not more than of the total million commitment 
all of these lenders have met their contractual funding commitments to us through january  an inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost effective rates could have a materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
capital expenditures our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program  including new store openings and store acquisitions  store relocations  maintenance of existing stores  the construction and upgrading of distribution centers  and the development of proprietary information systems and purchased information systems 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  or million more than fiscal  primarily due to routine spending on our existing stores and information technology investments  partially offset by fewer stores opened and the timing of store development expenditures 
during fiscal  we opened aap and ai stores  remodeled aap stores and relocated aap and ai stores 
our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the investments we make in information technology and supply chain networks 
during fiscal  we anticipate adding new aap and new ai stores 
we expect to relocate and remodel existing stores only in the normal course of business 
we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and supply chain network and to invest in new information systems to support our turnaround strategies  including the multi year implementation of a merchandising system 
in fiscal  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million to million 
stock repurchase program our stock repurchase program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or an average price of per share  leaving million remaining under our million stock repurchase program  excluding related expenses 
subsequent to january   our board of directors authorized a new million stock repurchase program on february  the new program cancelled and replaced the remaining portion of our previous million stock repurchase program  which was authorized on may  as of february   we have repurchased million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or an average price of per share  under our million stock repurchase program 

table of contents dividend our board of directors have paid quarterly dividends of per share to stockholders of record since fiscal subsequent to january   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share to be paid on april  to all common stockholders of record as of march  other liquidity during the last two years  we have transitioned certain of our merchandise vendors from a vendor financing program to a customer managed services arrangement  or vendor program 
under this vendor program  a third party provides an accounts payable tracking system which facilitates the participating suppliers ability to finance our payment obligations with designated third party financial institutions 
participating suppliers may  at their sole discretion  make offers to participating financial institutions to finance one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price 
our obligations to suppliers  including amounts due and scheduled payment dates  are not impacted by suppliers decisions to finance our accounts payable due to them under this arrangement 
our goal in entering into this arrangement is to capture overall supply chain savings in the form of pricing  payment terms or vendor funding  created by facilitating our suppliers ability to finance payment obligations at more favorable discount rates  while providing them with greater working capital flexibility 
any deterioration in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to secure funding for any of these programs  which would reduce our anticipated savings  including but not limited to  causing us to increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
analysis of cash flows a summary and analysis of our cash flows for fiscal  and is reflected in the table and following discussion 
fiscal year in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million 
this net increase in operating cash was driven primarily by a million increase in net income  million of which represented a non cash inventory adjustment in fiscal net of tax  a million increase in deferred income taxes  a million increase in cash flows from inventory  net of accounts payable  reflective of our slow down in inventory growth combined with the addition of vendors to our new vendor program this increase is partially offset by the reduction of financed vendor account payable included under financing activities as a result of our vendor program transition  and a million decrease in cash flows resulting from an increase in other working capital  including a million decrease in cash flows resulting from the timing of the payment of accrued operating expenses 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million

off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item of the sec regulations 
we include other off balance sheet arrangements in our contractual obligations table including operating lease payments  interest payments on our credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 
contractual obligations in addition to our revolving credit facility  we utilize operating leases as another source of financing

primarily includes employee benefits accruals  closed store liabilities  unrecognized tax benefits and deferred income taxes for which no contractual payment schedule exists and we expect the payments to occur beyond months from january  during the next months  it is possible that we could conclude on approximately to million of the contingencies associated with these tax uncertainties  a portion of which may be settled in cash and is reflected as a current liability 
we do not anticipate any significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources due to the conclusion of these tax matters 
long term debt bank debt we have a million unsecured five year revolving credit facility with our wholly owned subsidiary  advance stores company  incorporated  or stores  serving as the borrower 
the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit with a sub limit of million  and swingline loans in an amount not to exceed million 
we may request  subject to agreement by one or more lenders  that the total revolving commitment be increased by an amount not exceeding million up to a total commitment of billion during the term of the credit agreement 
voluntary prepayments and voluntary reductions of the revolving balance are permitted in whole or in part  at our option  in minimum principal amounts as specified in the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility matures on october  as of january   we had no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility  and letters of credit outstanding of million  which reduced the availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
the letters of credit generally have a term of one year or less 
a commitment fee is charged on the unused portion of the revolver  payable in arrears 
the current commitment fee rate is per annum 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  we had borrowed million under our unsecured four year term loan as of january  we entered into the term loan with stores serving as borrower 
the proceeds from the term loan were used to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program during fiscal the term loan matures on october  the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is based  at our option  on an adjusted libor rate  plus a margin  or an alternate base rate  plus a margin 
the current margin is and per annum for the adjusted libor and alternate base rate borrowings  respectively 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  the interest rate and commitment fee are based on our credit rating

we have elected to use the day adjusted libor rate and have the ability and intent to continue to use this rate on our hedged borrowings 
at january   the 
table of contents entire portion of our bank debt was hedged through the use of interest rate swaps which effectively fixed our libor at rates ranging from to 
other as of january   we had million outstanding under an economic development note and other financing arrangements 
guarantees and covenants the term loan and revolving credit facility are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by advance auto parts  inc our debt agreements collectively contain covenants restricting our ability to  among other things create  incur or assume additional debt including hedging arrangements  incur liens or engage in sale leaseback transactions  make loans and investments  guarantee obligations  engage in certain mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  change the nature of our business and the business conducted by our subsidiaries and change our status as a holding company

we were in compliance with these covenants at january  and january  our term loan and revolving credit facility also provide for customary events of default  covenant defaults and cross defaults to our other material indebtedness 
credit ratings at january   we had credit ratings from standard poor s of bb and from moody s investor service of ba  both of which are unchanged from january  the current outlooks by standard poor s and moody s are stable and positive  respectively 
the current pricing grid used to determine our borrowing rates under our term loan and revolving credit facility is based on our credit ratings  irrespective of the rating agencies outlooks 
if these credit ratings decline  our interest expense may increase 
conversely  if these credit ratings improve  our interest expense may decrease 
in addition  if our credit ratings decline  our access to financing may become more limited 
recent accounting developments we adopted several new accounting pronouncements as of the beginning of fiscal earnings per share earnings per share is determined using the two class method and is computed by dividing net income attributable to our common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period 
the two class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines income per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
diluted income per common share reflects the more dilutive earnings per share amount calculated using the treasury stock method or the two class method 
upon adoption of the two class method  prior period earnings per share data presented were adjusted retrospectively if applicable 
as a result  our diluted earnings per share decreased by for fiscal and basic earnings per share decreased by for fiscal for a complete discussion of our adoption of the two class method  see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report on form k

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term bank debt as a result of the movements in libor 
our long term bank debt consists of borrowings under a revolving credit facility and a term loan 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our bank debt  exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging activities 
our future exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated by utilizing interest rate swaps 
at january   our outstanding swaps fixed our libor on an aggregate of million of hedged debt at interest rates ranging from to
