executive overview although we recorded good operating results in our fourth quarter before the intangible assets and goodwill impairment charges  our operating results decreased in as compared to after completing our impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets  we concluded an impairment charge of  and  should be taken in connection with the recorded intangible assets and goodwill  respectively  arising from the ics acquisition in in  we recorded an impairment charge of  taken in connection with the recorded goodwill arising from our tdl and ics acquisitions made in and  respectively 
our sales decreased for the year ended december  by  principally due to a decrease in sales from our electronics group  which was primarily attributable to a delay by several months in the receipt of the mk order by ics 
gross profit margins decreased for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
our loss before income tax provision was  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  this decrease in loss was principally due to a decrease in the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges taken in the current year  a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense  an increase in investment and other income  and despite decreased sales from our electronics group and a decrease in gross profit 
our backlog at december  was approximately  compared to  at december  there is no seasonality to our business 
our shipping schedules are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from our customers 
both of our operating segments are pursuing a significant amount of business opportunities and we are confident that we will receive many of the orders we are pursuing  although timing is always an uncertainty 
our success over the past few years has significantly strengthened our balance sheet  as evidenced by our to current ratio at december  as a result of lower profitability related primarily to customer shipping and contract delays  we were not in compliance with certain of our financial covenants at various quarterly reporting periods during and these covenant defaults were waived by our financial lender in consideration for waiver fees and other consideration 
in march  we entered into a new credit agreement with a new commercial lender pursuant to which we a established a line of credit of up to  and b entered into a term loan in the amount of approximately  these new credit facilities were used to pay off in full our obligations to our former primary lender pursuant to a prior credit facility and to provide for us general working capital needs 
the new credit facilities are secured by a first priority lien and security interest in substantially all of our assets 
in august  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the period from august through december   we repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
total consideration for the repurchased stock was approximately  from august through march   we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for total cash consideration of  representing an average price of per share 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based on our financial statements and the data used to prepare them 
our financial statements have been prepared based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to inventory valuation  the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  goodwill impairment  valuation of share based compensation  revenue and cost recognition on long term contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method and other than temporary impairment on marketable securities 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current business conditions and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventory is valued at the lower of cost specific  average and first in  first out basis or market 
inventory items are reviewed regularly for excess and obsolete inventory based on an estimated forecast of product demand 
demand for our products can be forecasted based on current backlog  customer options to reorder under existing contracts  the need to retrofit older units and parts needed for general repairs 
although we make every effort to insure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have an impact on the level of obsolete material in our inventory and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
however  world events have forced our country into various situations of conflict whereby equipment is used and parts may be needed for repair 
this could lead to increased product demand as well as the use of some older inventory items that we had previously determined obsolete 
deferred tax asset at december   we had an alternative minimum tax credit of approximately  with no limitation on the carry forward period and federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively that expire through approximately   of federal net operating loss carry forwards expire between in addition  we receive a tax deduction when our employees exercise their non qualified stock options thereby increasing our deferred tax asset 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that a portion of the amount may not be realized 
we estimate our valuation allowance based on an estimated forecast of our future profitability 
any significant changes in future profitability resulting from variations in future revenues or expenses could affect the valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset and operating results could be affected  accordingly 
impairment of goodwill we have a significant amount of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
in determining the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  assumptions are made regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
after completing the impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets  we concluded an impairment charge should be taken at december  in connection with the recorded goodwill and intangible assets arising from the acquisition of ics in in addition  we concluded an impairment charge should be taken at december  in connection with the recorded goodwill arising from our tdl and ics acquisitions made between and our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and our weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates 
discount rates selected for each reporting unit varied 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
the balance of our goodwill for each of our operating units as of december  is as follows tdl  ics  and behlman  after the impairment charges taken on the goodwill and intangible assets of ics at december   of the three reporting units with goodwill  tdl  ics and behlman has a fair value that is in excess of its carrying value by approximately  and  respectively 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our actual results and or estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation awards by recording compensation based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and expensing such compensation over the vesting periods of the awards  which is generally one to ten years 
total share based compensation expense was  for the year ended december  the estimated fair values of stock options granted in were calculated using the black scholes model 
this model requires the use of input assumptions 
these assumptions include expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
revenue and cost recognition revenue and costs under larger  long term contracts are reported on the percentage of completion method 
for projects where materials have been purchased  but have not been placed in production  the costs of such materials are excluded from costs incurred for the purpose of measuring the extent of progress toward completion 
the amount of earnings recognized at the financial statement date is based on an efforts expended method  which measures the degree of completion on a contract based on the amount of labor dollars incurred compared to the total labor dollars expected to complete the contract 
when an ultimate loss is indicated on a contract  the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period 
assets related to these contracts are included in current assets as they will be liquidated in the normal course of contract completion  although this may require more than one year 
marketable securities we currently have approximately  invested in government and corporate bonds 
we treat our investments as available for sale which requires us to assess our portfolio each reporting period to determine whether declines in fair value below book value are considered to be other than temporary 
we must first determine that we have both the intent and ability to hold a security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in its fair value to its amortized cost 
in assessing whether the entire amortized cost basis of the security will be recovered  we compare the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected from the security determination of fair value with the amortized cost basis of the security 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its fair value and the write down is included in earnings as a realized loss  and a new cost is established for the security 
any further impairment of the security related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
any subsequent recovery in fair value is not recognized until the security either is sold or matures 
we use several factors in our determination of the cash flows expected to be collected including i the length of time and extent to which market value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  iii whether a decline in fair value is attributable to adverse conditions specifically related to the security or specific conditions in an industry  iv whether interest payments continue to be made and v any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 
although we received all our interest payments during the current year  we recorded an other than temporary impairment write down of  for the three months ended march  consisting of bonds held in two separate issuers in which we determined the decline in fair value was due to adverse conditions specifically related to the security or specific conditions in an industry 
we did not take any additional other than temporary impairment charges for the remainder of results of operations year ended december  vs 
year ended december  we currently operate in two industry segments 
our orbit instrument division and our tdl subsidiary are engaged in the design and manufacture of electronic components and subsystems and our ics subsidiary performs system integration for gun weapons systems and fire control interface as well as logistics support and documentation the electronics group 
our behlman subsidiary is engaged in the design and manufacture of commercial power units and cots power solutions the power group 
consolidated net sales for the year ended december  decreased by to  from  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in sales from our electronics group which was partially offset by a slight increase in sales from our power group 
sales from our electronics group decreased by due to primarily to a delay in the receipt of the mk order by ics until the end of the third quarter of this order was expected early in the second quarter of which approximated the time of receipt in the prior year 
the mk is recorded under the percentage of completion method 
sales from our orbit instrument division increased for the year and sales from our tdl subsidiary decreased due to certain scheduled deliveries that were delayed at the request of our customer in order for them to complete testing of their completed unit 
sales from our power group slightly increased by for the current year as the segment recorded its second consecutive year of record sales 
gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  for the year ended december  decreased to from for the prior year 
this decrease resulted from a lower gross profit from our electronics group v 
due to a lower gross profit from ics due to a decrease in sales  which was partially offset by a higher gross profit from tdl despite lower sales and a higher gross profit from our orbit instrument division 
the slight decrease in gross profit v 
from our power group was principally due to product mix and despite the slight increase in sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  principally due to a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from our electronics group that was partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative costs from our power group and higher corporate costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  principally due to the aforementioned decrease in sales that was not commensurate with the decrease in expenses 
during the fourth quarter  in addition to the significant delay in the receipt of the mk order  we were notified by our customer that a replacement was under consideration for a portion of future mk requirements for which ics was being considered but not guaranteed of future awards 
consequently  we determined that future cash flows for ics  particularly with respect to mk orders  could potentially decrease 
as a result  we determined the undiscounted future cash flows for certain of our intangible assets were less than their carrying value 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge relating to our intangible assets in the amount of  in the year ended december  representing the excess carrying values over their fair values 
also during the fourth quarter  after completing the annual impairment testing of goodwill pursuant to asc  we concluded an impairment charge of  should be take in connection with the goodwill arising from the acquisition of ics in in the prior year  after completing our impairment testing  we concluded an impairment charge of  should be taken in connection with the recorded goodwill arising from our tdl and ics acquisitions made in and  respectively 
interest expense for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  due to a decrease in the amounts owed to lenders in the current year due to the pay down of our term debt and to a decrease in interest rates 
investment and other income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the prior year principally due to a  other than temporary impairment loss taken in the prior year related to certain corporate bonds held by us and despite a decrease in the amounts invested and a decrease in interest rates 
loss before income tax provision was  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  this decrease in loss was principally due to a decrease in the goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges taken in the current year  a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and interest expense  an increase in investment and other income and despite decreased sales from our electronics group and a decrease in gross profit 
income taxes for the year ended december  and december  consist of  and  respectively  in state income and federal minimum taxes that cannot be offset by any state or federal net operating loss carry forwards 
as a result of the foregoing  net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ended december  listed below is the ebitda reconciliation to net income year ended december  net loss   interest expense   income tax expense   goodwill and intangible asset impairment   depreciation and amortization   ebitda   ebitda is a non gaap financial measure and should not be construed as an alternative to net income 
an element of our growth strategy has been through strategic acquisitions which have been substantially funded through the issuance of debt 
this has resulted in significant interest expense and amortization expense 
ebitda is presented as additional information because we believe it is useful to our investors and management as a measure of cash generated by our business operations that will be used to service our debt and fund future acquisitions as well as provide an additional element of operating performance 
liquidity  capital resources and inflation working capital decreased to  at december  as compared to  at december  despite the decrease in working capital  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  compared to to at december  the reduction in working capital was principally due to the repayment of long term debt and the purchase of treasury stock 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the non cash intangible asset and goodwill impairment charges  amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and stock based compensation and the decrease in accounts receivable that was partially offset by the net loss for the year  an increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings and a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the net loss for the year  the non cash deferred income  increase in accounts receivable and inventory and decrease in accrued expenses  taxes payable and customer advances that was partially offset by the non cash goodwill impairment charge  amortization of intangible assets  depreciation and stock based compensation  the decrease in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings and amounts due from ics sellers  and an increase in accounts payable cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  attributable to the purchase of fixed assets  incurred by tdl in connection with its new operating facility that was partially offset by the sale of marketable securities and fixed assets 
cash flows provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was  attributable to the sale of marketable securities that was partially offset by the purchase of marketable securities and fixed assets  and costs associated with our ics acquisition 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the repayments of long term debt and purchase of treasury stock that was partially offset from loan proceeds from our line of credit and stock option exercises 
cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  primarily attributable to the repayments of long term debt and purchase of treasury stock that was partially offset from loan proceeds from our line of credit 
in april  we entered into a five year  term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of tdl and its manufacturing affiliate tdl term loan 
in december  we entered into a five year  term loan agreement to finance the acquisition of ics ics term loan 
principal payments under the two term loan facilities were approximately  per month 
in december  we also amended an existing  line of credit facility with a commercial lender secured by accounts receivable  inventory and property and equipment 
in connection with the ics term loan entered into in december  the interest rates on both term loan facilities and the line of credit facility were amended to equal a certain percentage plus the one month libor at december  depending on a matrix related to a certain financial covenant 
the line of credit facility was to continue from year to year unless sooner terminated for an event of default including non compliance with certain financial covenants 
in april  we entered into a five year  promissory note with the selling shareholders of tdl tdl shareholder note at an interest rate of prime plus at december  
principal payments of  were made on a quarterly basis along with accrued interest 
in june  we refinanced the  balance due on the tdl shareholder note with our primary commercial lender 
under the terms of the new term loan entered into with our primary commercial lender tdl refinanced shareholder loan  monthly payments of  were made over a thirty month period through january along with accrued interest pursuant to the interest terms described below 
the tdl refinanced shareholder loan was paid off in january as a result of lower profitability related to customer shipping delays in the first and second quarter of  we were not in compliance with two of our financial covenants at september  in november  our primary lender waived the covenant default of two of our financial ratios at september  and we renegotiated the financial covenant ratios for the quarterly reporting periods december  and march  beginning june   the covenants were to revert back to their original ratios with a modification to a certain financial ratio covenant definition 
the lender instituted an unused line fee of 
per annum  as a cost to us for the waiver and amendment to the loan agreements 
in connection therewith  the interest rate on the tdl term loan and tdl refinanced shareholder loan  increased to the sum of plus the one month libor and the interest rate on the ics term loan and line of credit was increased to the sum of plus the one month libor 
we were in compliance with all financial covenants at march  as a result of decreased revenue and profitability due to the customer contract delay for the mk that is recorded under the percentage of completion method  we were not in compliance with two of our financial covenant ratios as of june  in august  our primary lender agreed to waive these covenant defaults 
the lender  in consideration of such waiver  assessed a waiver fee of  and increased the interest rate on all term debt  including the tdl term loan  tdl refinanced shareholder loan and ics term loan  and the line of credit equal to the sum of plus the one month libor 
in addition  we agreed to reduce our line of credit from  to  until october   at which time it was further reduced to  as a result of the customer contract delay for the mk and capital expenditures made for our new tdl operating facility  we were not in compliance with two of our financial covenant ratios at september  in november  our primary lender agreed to waive the covenant defaults as of september  and to amend the requirement for two of the financial ratios at december  and for one of the financial ratios at march  our lender  in consideration of such waiver  assessed a waiver fee of  and increased the interest rate on all term debt  including the tdl term loan  tdl refinanced shareholder loan and ics term loan  and the line of credit to the sum of plus the one month libor 
in addition  we agreed to reduce our line of credit from  to  at december  we were in compliance with all financial covenants at december  on march   we entered into a new credit agreement the credit agreement with a new commercial lender pursuant to which we a established a new line of credit of up to  and b entered into a term loan in the amount of approximately  these new credit facilities were used to pay off all of our obligations to our former primary lender and to provide for our general working capital needs 
the new credit facilities are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the term loan is payable in consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest and matures on march  the line of credit matures on june  payment of interest on all loans is due at a rate per annum at our option as follows for a prime rate loan under the line of credit at a rate equal to the prime rate established by the bank plus  for a prime rate loan under the term loan at a rate equal to the prime rate established by the bank plus  for a libor loan under the line of credit at a rate equal to libor plus and for a libor loan under the term loan at a rate equal to libor plus 
the credit agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and certain financial covenants 
available borrowings under the line of credit are subject to a borrowing base of eligible accounts receivable  inventory and  for the term loan facility only  cash and marketable securities 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default such as non payment  bankruptcy and material adverse change 
pursuant to the terms of our new lending arrangement entered into with a new commercial lender in march and in accordance with asc  we i reclassified the tdl term loan  with a maturity date in  to long term and ii reclassified the short term portion of our term loans at december  our existing capital resources  including our bank credit facilities and our cash flow from operations  is expected to be adequate to cover our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
in august  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions 
during the period from august through december   we repurchased approximately  shares at an average price of per share 
total consideration for the repurchased stock was approximately  from august through march   we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock for total cash consideration of  representing an average price of per share 
inflation has not materially impacted the operations of our company 
certain material trends during the second quarter of  our orbit instrument division was verbally advised by one of its larger customers to provide support for the immediate development of certain modifications to a critical product for the division 
this out of scope support caused a delay in a significant amount of shipments scheduled throughout which resulted in a decrease in revenue and profitability for we worked closely with this customer and shipment of the units resumed in the third quarter 
however  a significant number of units scheduled for shipment by december  were shipped in in addition  that same customer approached us and requested a modification to the existing memorandum of agreement so that additional units could be procured before the end of the year 
however  this modification was delayed and not received by us until august consequently  certain shipments planned for will be delayed until in addition  the modification also contained an option for our customer to procure additional units provided such option was exercised by the year end 
our customer requested and we agreed to additional units being added to the option quantity and such option was exercised by year end 
these units are also scheduled for delivery in for our orbit instrument division 
ics experienced a delay in the award for its mk gun console system which affected its first and second quarter shipments in this award was finally received by ics at the end of september ics had commenced the procurement process of material and labor resources were allocated to the job beginning in the second quarter 
as a result  certain cabinets were delivered by year end but due to the delay in the receipt of the award  other cabinets will not be delivered until the second quarter of shipment delays related to contracting  funding and engineering issues are commonplace in our industry and could  in the future  have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
during the fourth quarter of  in addition to the significant delay in the receipt of the mk order  we were notified by our customer that a replacement was under consideration for a portion of future mk requirements for which ics was being considered but not guaranteed of future awards 
consequently  we believe that cash flows for ics in the immediate future  particularly with respect to mk orders  could potentially decrease 
after completing the impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets pursuant to asc and asc  we concluded an impairment charge of  and  should be taken in connection with the recorded intangible assets and goodwill arising from the acquisition of ics in however  ics  in addition to its bid on two of the replacement programs  is currently being considered as a subcontractor for one of the prime contractors currently bidding for the littoral combat ship which is a significant program being considered by the us navy 
in the event that mk awards are even less than expected for and the prospects for additional mk awards or replacement opportunities diminish  the fair market value of the goodwill for ics of  could be further impaired 
our power group had a record year of bookings and revenue in and another record year of revenue in the commercial division of our power group has historically been vulnerable to a weak economy 
bookings in the commercial division were weak during most of but bookings from the cots division remained fairly strong 
however  despite current economic conditions and its effect on capital spending  our power group s commercial division recorded its strongest bookings of the year in the fourth quarter of however  due to continued weakness in the economy  it is uncertain whether the commercial division can sustain the improvement from the fourth quarter 
the strength of our cots division will position our power group for a strong year of revenue and profitability for but improvement in the commercial division will be needed to continue its trend of record revenues 
in april  our company completed the acquisition of tdl and its operations became part of our electronics group 
in december  we completed the acquisition of ics which also became part of our electronics group 
our electronics group and the cots division of our power group are heavily dependent on military spending 
the events of september   have put a tremendous emphasis on defense and homeland security spending and we have benefited from an increasing defense budget 
although our electronics group and our cots division of our power group are pursuing several opportunities for reorders  as well as new contract awards  we have normally found it difficult to predict the timing of such awards 
in addition  we have an unprecedented amount of new opportunities that are in the prototype or pre production stage 
these opportunities generally move to a production stage at a later date but the timing of such is also uncertain 
there is no seasonality to our business 
our revenues are generally determined by the shipping schedules outlined in the purchase orders received from its customers 
we stratify all the opportunities we are pursuing by various confidence levels 
we generally realize a very high success rate with those opportunities to which we apply a high confidence level 
we currently have a significant amount of potential contract awards to which we have applied a high confidence level 
however  because it is difficult to predict the timing of awards for most of the opportunities we are pursuing  it is also difficult to predict when we will commence shipping under these contracts 
a delay in the receipt of any contract from our customer ultimately causes a corresponding delay in shipments under that contract 
during through  due to shipping schedules resulting from contract delays  our second half of the year was stronger than the first half 
we again expect ics s new orders for to be received at a similar time as was received in so we once again expect the second half of to be stronger than the first half 
despite the increase in military spending  we still face a challenging environment 
the government is emphasizing the engineering of new and improved weaponry and it continues to be our challenge to work with each of our prime contractors so that we can participate on these new programs 
in addition  these new contracts require incurring up front design  engineering  prototype and pre production costs 
while we attempt to negotiate contract awards for reimbursement of product development  there is no assurance that sufficient monies will be set aside by our customers  including the united states government  for such effort 
in addition  even if the united states government agrees to reimburse development costs  there is still a significant risk of cost overrun that may not be reimbursable 
furthermore  once we have completed the design and pre production stage  there is no assurance that funding will be provided for future production 
in such event  even if we are reimbursed our development costs it will not generate any significant profits 
we are heavily dependent upon military spending as a source of revenues and income 
however  even increased military spending does not necessarily guarantee us increased revenues  particularly  when the allocation of budget dollars may vary depending on what may be needed for specific military conflicts any future reductions in the level of military spending by the united states government due to budget constraints or for any other reason  could have a negative impact on our future revenues and earnings 
we believe that defense budget dollars that are allocated to modernization and refurbishment of military equipment will generally benefit us 
in addition  due to major consolidations in the defense industry  it has become more difficult to avoid dependence on certain customers for revenue and income 
behlman s line of commercial products gives us some diversity and the additions of tdl and ics gives our electronics segment a more diversified customer base 
our business strategy had been to expand our operations through strategic  accretive acquisitions 
through the past several years  we reviewed various potential acquisitions and believe there are numerous opportunities presently available  particularly to integrate into our current operating facilities 
in april  we completed the acquisition of tdl and in december  we completed the acquisition of ics 
however  due to current economic conditions and tightening of credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will obtain the necessary financing to complete additional acquisitions and even if we do  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient income from operations of such acquired companies to satisfy the interest payments  in which case  we will be required to pay them out of our operations which may be adversely affected 
during the second quarter of  we expanded the activities of our investment banker to include the pursuit of alternative strategies  including the potential sale of the company as a means of enhancing shareholder value 
in june  we terminated such activities with the investment banker 
in may  we hired a new investment banker and continue to pursue strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value 
however  there is no assurance that a sale or any of the other strategic alternatives will be accomplished
