item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital 
the federal deposit insurance corporation act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the corporation and the bank are classified as well capitalized 
fdicia also requires the bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements within these five categories  with progressively more severe restrictions on operations  management and capital distributions according to the category in which an institution is placed 
failure to meet capital requirements can also cause an institution to be directed to raise additional capital 
fdicia also mandates that the agencies adopt safety and soundness standards relating generally to operations and management  asset quality and executive compensation  and authorizes administrative action against an institution that fails to meet such standards 
in addition  the federal reserve board and the fdic have each adopted risk based capital standards that explicitly identify concentrations of credit risk and the risk arising from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  as important factors to be taken into account by each agency in assessing an institution s overall capital adequacy 
the capital guidelines also provide that an institution s exposure to a decline in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates be considered by the agency as a factor in evaluating a banking organization s capital adequacy 
in addition to the prompt corrective action directives  failure to meet capital guidelines can subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities  termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and under some conditions the appointment of a conservator or receiver 
dividends 
the corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
the majority of our revenue is from dividends we receive from the bank 
the bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay 
if  in the opinion of a federal regulatory agency  an institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice  the agency may require  after notice and a hearing  that the institution cease and desist from such practice 
the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete an institution s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
under fdicia  an insured institution may not pay a dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized 
moreover  the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued policy statements providing that bank holding companies and banks should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings 
under kentucky law  dividends by kentucky banks may be paid only from current or retained net profits 
before any dividend may be declared for any period other than with respect to preferred stock  a bank must increase its capital surplus by at least of the net profits of the bank for the period until the bank s capital surplus equals the amount of its stated capital attributable to its common stock 
moreover  the kdfi commissioner must approve the declaration of dividends if the total dividends to be declared by a bank for any calendar year would exceed the bank s total net profits for such year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of preferred stock or debt 
we are also subject to the kentucky business corporation act  which generally prohibits dividends to the extent they result in the insolvency of the corporation from a balance sheet perspective or if becoming unable to pay debts as they come due 
consumer protection laws 
we are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population 
these laws include the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the truth in lending act  the home mortgage disclosure act  and the real estate settlement procedures act  and state law counterparts 
federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protections provisions 
under these provisions  a financial institution must provide to its customers  at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter  the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information 
these provisions also provide that  except for certain limited exceptions  an institution may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure 
federal law makes it a criminal offense  except in limited circumstances  to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means 
the community reinvestment act cra requires the fdic to assess our record in meeting the credit needs of the communities we serve  including low and moderate income neighborhoods and persons 
the fdic s assessment of our record is made available to the public 
the assessment also is part of the federal reserve board s consideration of applications to acquire  merge or consolidate with another banking institution or its holding company  to establish a new branch office or to relocate an office 
the federal reserve board will also assess the cra record of the subsidiary banks of a bank holding company in its consideration of any application to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  which may be the basis for denying the application 
bank secrecy act 
the bank secrecy act of bsa was enacted to deter money laundering  establish regulatory reporting standards for currency transactions and improve detection and investigation of criminal  tax and other regulatory violations 
bsa and subsequent laws and regulations require us to take steps to prevent the use of the bank in the flow of illegal or illicit money  including  without limitation  ensuring effective management oversight  establishing sound policies and procedures  developing effective monitoring and reporting capabilities  ensuring adequate training and establishing a comprehensive internal audit of bsa compliance activities 
in recent years  federal regulators have increased the attention paid to compliance with the provisions of bsa and related laws  with particular attention paid to know your customer practices 
banks have been encouraged by regulators to enhance their identification procedures prior to accepting new customers in order to deter criminal elements from using the banking system to move and hide illegal and illicit activities 
usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act of the patriot act contains anti money laundering measures affecting insured depository institutions  broker dealers and certain other financial institutions 
the patriot act requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism  including standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
the patriot act also grants the secretary of the treasury broad authority to establish regulations and to impose requirements and restrictions on financial institutions operations 
in addition  the patriot act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution s anti money laundering activities when reviewing bank mergers and bank holding company acquisitions 
federal deposit insurance assessments 
the deposits of our bank subsidiary are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund  or the dif  of the fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif 
the fdic utilizes a risk based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank s capital level and supervisory rating 
effective january   the fdic imposed deposit assessment rates based on the risk category of the bank subsidiary 
risk category i is the lowest risk category while risk category iv is the highest risk category 
because of favorable loss experience and a healthy reserve ratio in the bank insurance fund  or the bif  of the fdic  well capitalized and well managed banks  have in recent years paid minimal premiums for fdic insurance 
with the additional deposit insurance  a deposit premium refund  in the form of credit offsets  was granted to banks that were in existence on december  and paid deposit insurance premiums prior to that date 
for and the first half of  our subsidiary bank utilized the credits to offset a majority of its fdic insurance assessment 
on october   the fdic published a restoration plan designed to replenish the deposit insurance fund over a period of five years and to increase the deposit insurance reserve ratio  which decreased to of insured deposits on june   to the statutory minimum of of insured deposits by december  in order to implement the restoration plan  the fdic proposes to change both its risk based assessment system and its base assessment rates 
for the first quarter of only  the fdic increased all fdic deposit assessment rates by basis points 
these new rates range from to basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
under the fdic s restoration plan  the fdic proposes to establish new initial base assessment rates that will be subject to adjustment as described below 
beginning april   the base assessment rates would range from to basis points for risk category i institutions to basis points for risk category iv institutions 
changes to the risk based assessment system would include increasing premiums for institutions that rely on excessive amounts of brokered deposits  increasing premiums for excessive use of secured liabilities including federal home loan bank advances  lowering premiums for smaller institutions with very high capital levels  and adding financial ratios and debt issuer ratings to the premium calculations for banks with over billion in assets  while providing a reduction for their unsecured debt 
either an increase in the risk category of the company s bank subsidiary or adjustments to the base assessment rates could result in a material increase in our expense for federal deposit insurance 
in addition  all institutions with deposits insured by the fdic are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  a mixed ownership government corporation established to recapitalize a predecessor to the deposit insurance fund 
the current annualized assessment rate is basis points  or approximately 
basis points per quarter 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in the fdic implemented a five basis point emergency special assessment on insured depository institutions as of june  the special assessment was paid on september  this assessment resulted in a cost of  and is reflected in our income statement for the interim rule also authorizes the fdic to impose an additional emergency assessment of up to basis points in respect to deposits for quarters ended after june  if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the fdic approved that all banks prepay three and a quarter years worth of fdic assessments on december  the prepayment is based on average third quarter deposits 
the prepaid amount will be amortized over the prepayment period 
our prepayment was million of which  was reflected in our income statement related to the fourth quarter premium 
emergency economic stabilization act 
in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted 
the eesa authorizes the treasury department to purchase from financial institutions and their holding companies up to billion in mortgage loans  mortgage related securities and certain other financial instruments  including debt and equity securities issued by financial institutions and their holding companies in a troubled asset relief program tarp 
the purpose of tarp is to restore confidence and stability to the us banking system and to encourage financial institutions to increase their lending to customers and to each other 
the treasury department has allocated billion towards the tarp capital purchase program cpp 
under the cpp  treasury has purchased debt or equity securities from participating institutions  including us 
the tarp also includes direct purchases or guarantees of troubled assets of financial institutions 
participants in the cpp are subject to executive compensation limits and are encouraged to expand their lending and mortgage loan modifications 
for details regarding our sale of million of preferred stock to the treasury department through the cpp  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation capital and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
eesa also increased fdic deposit insurance on most accounts from  to  this increase is in place until december  and is not covered by deposit insurance premiums paid by the banking industry 
temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the fdic established a temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp on october  the tlgp includes the transaction account guarantee program tagp  which provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage through june  for noninterest bearing transaction accounts typically business checking accounts and certain funds swept into noninterest bearing savings accounts 
institutions participating in the tagp pay a basis points fee annualized on the balance of each covered account in excess of  while the extra deposit insurance is in place 
the tlgp also includes the debt guarantee program dgp  under which the fdic guarantees certain senior unsecured debt of fdic insured institutions and their holding companies 
the unsecured debt must be issued on or after october  and not later than october   and the guarantee is effective through the earlier of the maturity date or june  the dgp coverage limit is generally of the eligible entity s eligible debt outstanding on september  and scheduled to mature on or before june  or  for certain insured institutions  of their liabilities as of september  depending on the term of the debt maturity  the nonrefundable dgp fee ranges from to basis points annualized for covered debt outstanding until the earlier of maturity or june  the tagp and dgp are in effect for all eligible entities  unless the entity opted out on or before december  first financial service corporation s bank subsidiary elected to participate in the tagp and both the bank subsidiary and the holding company are eligible to participate in dgp 
certificate of deposit account registry service 
to mitigate the risks associated with carrying balances in excess of federally insured limits  we are participating in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
cdars is a system that allows certificates of deposit that would be in excess of fdic coverage in a single financial institution to be redistributed to other financial institutions within the cdars network in increments under the current fdic coverage limit 
consequently  the full amount of the certificates of deposit becomes eligible for fdic protection 
american recovery and reinvestment act 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future cpp recipients  including first financial service corporation  until the institution has repaid the treasury 
arra also permits cpp participants to redeem the preferred shares held by the treasury department without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency

item a 
risk factors the risks identified below  as well as in the other cautionary statements made throughout this report  identify factors that could materially and adversely affect our business  future results of operations  and future cash flows 
our business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by current conditions in the financial markets and by economic conditions generally 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing severe recessionary conditions for more than a year 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
reduced consumer spending and the absence of liquidity in the global credit markets during the current recession have depressed business activity across a wide range of industries 
unemployment has also increased significantly 
sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically in our markets has had and could continue to have the following adverse effects on our business a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services that we offer  a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate  an impairment of certain intangible assets  an increase in the number of clients who become delinquent  file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us 
an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies or defaults has resulted in a higher level of nonperforming assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses 
overall  during the past year  the general business environment has had an adverse effect on our business  and there can be no assurance that the environment will improve in the near term 
until conditions improve  we expect our businesses  financial condition and results of operations to be adversely affected 
ongoing market developments may continue to adversely affect our industry  businesses and results of operations 
since mid  the financial services industry as a whole  as well as the securities markets generally  have been materially and adversely affected by very significant declines in the values of nearly all asset classes and by a very serious lack of liquidity 
financial institutions in particular have been subject to increased volatility and an overall loss in investor confidence 
concerns about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties have caused many lenders and institutional investors to reduce  and in some cases  cease to provide funding to borrowers including financial institutions 
the lack of available credit  loss of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity have materially and adversely affected our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further negative market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates  which may impact our charge offs and provisions for credit losses 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial services industry 
our decisions regarding credit risk may not be accurate  and our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual losses  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level we believe is adequate to absorb any probable incurred losses in our loan portfolio based on historical loan loss experience  specific problem loans  value of underlying collateral and other relevant factors 
if our assessment of these factors is ultimately inaccurate  the allowance may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses  which would adversely affect our operating results 
our estimates are subjective and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events 
changes in economic  operating and other conditions that are generally beyond our control  including changes in interest rates  could cause actual loan losses to increase significantly 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their supervisory functions  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
regulatory agencies have from time to time required us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs when their judgment has differed from ours  and may do so in the future  which could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
our loan portfolio possesses increased risk due to our relatively high concentration of loans collateralized by real estate 
approximately of our loan portfolio as of december  was comprised of loans collateralized by real estate 
an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate generally or in our primary markets such as we have recently experienced could significantly impair the value of our collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
when real estate values decline  it becomes more likely that we would be required to increase our allowance for loan losses as we did in if during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for loan losses  it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of our investments  financial performance and capital 
under us generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our investment portfolio periodically for the presence of other than temporary impairment of our securities  taking into consideration current market conditions  the extent and nature of change in fair value  issuer rating changes and trends  volatility of earnings  current analysts evaluations  our ability and intent to hold investments until a recovery of fair value  as well as other factors 
adverse developments with respect to one or more of the foregoing factors may require us to deem particular securities to be other than temporarily impaired  with the reduction in the value recognized as a charge to earnings 
recent market volatility has made it extremely difficult to value certain securities 
subsequent valuations  in light of factors prevailing at that time  may result in significant changes in the values of these securities in future periods 
any of these factors could require us to recognize further impairments in the value of our securities portfolio  which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
because most of our business activities are conducted in central kentucky and adjacent counties of indiana  and most of our credit exposure is in that region  we are at risk from adverse economic or business developments affecting this area  including declining regional and local business activity  a downturn in real estate values and agricultural activities and natural disasters 
to date  the declines in real estate values in our markets have been moderate compared to the severe declines experienced in other regions 
to the extent the central kentucky economy further declines  the rates of delinquencies  foreclosures  bankruptcies and losses in our loan portfolio would likely increase 
moreover  the value of real estate or other collateral that secures our loans could be adversely affected by economic downturn or a localized natural disaster 
an economic downturn or other events that affect our markets could  therefore  result in losses that may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
our small to medium sized business target market may have fewer resources to weather the downturn in the economy 
our strategy includes lending to small and medium sized businesses and other commercial enterprises 
small and medium sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competitors  may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial variations in operating results  any of which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan 
in addition  the success of a small and medium sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons  and the death  disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay our loan 
economic downturns and other events could have a more pronounced negative impact on our target market  which could cause us to incur substantial credit losses that could materially harm our operating results 
our profitability is vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates 
changes in interest rates could harm our financial condition or results of operations 
our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions 
factors beyond our control  such as inflation  recession  unemployment  and money supply may also affect interest rates 
if our interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than our interest bearing liabilities in a given period  as a result of decreasing interest rates  our net interest income may decrease 
likewise  our net interest income may decrease if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period as a result of increasing interest rates 
fixed rate loans increase our exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest bearing liabilities would be subject to repricing before assets become subject to repricing 
adjustable rate loans decrease the risk associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks  such as the inability of borrowers to make higher payments in an increasing interest rate environment 
at the same time  for secured loans  the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates 
in the current low interest rate environment  there may be an increase in prepayments on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates  which could reduce net interest income and harm our results of operations 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available when needed or at all 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of our control  and our financial performance 
we cannot assure you that capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our businesses  financial condition and results of operations 
if we cannot borrow funds through access to the capital markets  we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers  or meet the operating cash needs of the corporation to fund corporate expansion or other activities 
our liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors  with operating limits set by the asset liability committee alco  based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits  the percentage of assets funded with non core or wholesale funding 
the alco regularly monitors the overall liquidity position of the bank and the corporation to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity 
liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
if our liquidity policies and strategies don t work as well as intended  then we may be unable to make loans and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
the alco follows established board approved policies and monitors guidelines to diversify our wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source 
wholesale funding sources include federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  non core brokered deposits  and medium and long term debt  which includes federal home loan bank fhlb advances that are collateralized with mortgage related assets 
we maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity 
there are other available sources of liquidity  including the sale or securitization of loans  the ability to acquire additional non core brokered deposits  additional collateralized borrowings such as fhlb advances  the issuance of debt securities  and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions 
if we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed  we might not be able to meet the needs of our customers  which could adversely impact our financial condition  our results of operations  cash flows  and our level of regulatory qualifying capital 
for further discussion  see the liquidity section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we face strong competition from other financial institutions and financial service companies  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we compete with other financial institutions in attracting deposits and making loans 
our competition in attracting deposits comes principally from commercial banks  credit unions  savings and loan associations  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market funds and other mutual funds 
competition in making loans in the louisville metropolitan area has increased in recent years after changes in banking law allowed several banks to enter the market by establishing new branches 
likewise  competition is increasing in our other markets  which may adversely affect our ability to maintain our market share 
competition in the banking industry may also limit our ability to attract and retain banking clients 
we maintain smaller staffs of associates and have fewer financial and other resources than larger institutions with which we compete 
financial institutions that have far greater resources and greater efficiencies than we do may have several marketplace advantages resulting from their ability to offer higher interest rates on deposits and lower interest rates on loans than we can  offer a broader range of services than we do  maintain numerous branch locations  and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
in addition  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and other financial intermediaries may not be subject to the same regulatory restrictions as we are and may have larger lending limits than we do 
some of our current commercial banking clients may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than we can accommodate 
if we are unable to attract and retain customers  we may not be able to maintain growth and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be negatively impacted 
while management continually monitors and improves our system of internal controls  data processing systems  and corporate wide processes and procedures  there can be no assurance that we will not suffer losses from operational risk in the future 
management maintains internal operational controls and we have invested in technology to help us process large volumes of transactions 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels of transactions 
if our systems of internal controls should fail to work as expected  if our systems were to be used in an unauthorized manner  or if employees were to subvert the system of internal controls  significant losses could occur 
we process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types of operation risk  which could cause us to incur substantial losses 
operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people  and systems includes the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside of our company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  errors relating to transaction processing and systems  and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards 
we establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk 
while not foolproof  these systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate  cost effective levels 
we have also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct  ethics  and business practices are followed 
nevertheless  we experience loss from operational risk from time to time  including the effects of operational errors  and these losses may be substantial 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and  as a result  are subject to extensive regulation and supervision that could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to implement our growth and operating strategies 
we are subject to examination  supervision and comprehensive regulation by federal and state regulatory agencies  which is described under item business regulation 
regulatory oversight of banks is primarily intended to protect depositors  the federal deposit insurance funds  and the banking system as a whole  not our shareholders 
compliance with these regulations is costly and may make it more difficult to operate profitably 
federal and state banking laws and regulations govern numerous matters including the payment of dividends  the acquisition of other banks and the establishment of new banking offices 
we must also meet specific regulatory capital requirements 
our failure to comply with these laws  regulations and policies or to maintain our capital requirements affects our ability to pay dividends on common stock  our ability to grow through the development of new offices and our ability to make acquisitions 
we currently may not pay a dividend from the bank to the corporation without the prior written consent of our primary banking regulators  which limits our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
these limitations may also prevent us from successfully implementing our growth and operating strategies 
in addition  the laws and regulations applicable to banks could change at any time  which could significantly impact our business and profitability 
for example  new legislation or regulation could limit the manner in which we may conduct our business  including our ability to attract deposits and make loans 
events that may not have a direct impact on us  such as the bankruptcy or insolvency of a prominent us corporation  can cause legislators and banking regulators and other agencies such as the financial accounting standards board  the sec  the public company accounting oversight board and various taxing authorities to respond by adopting and or proposing substantive revisions to laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies  and interpretations 
the nature  extent  and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations  or changes in or repeal of existing laws and regulations may have a material impact on our business and results of operations 
changes in regulation may cause us to devote substantial additional financial resources and management time to compliance  which may negatively affect our operating results 
our issuance of securities to the us department of the treasury may limit our ability to return capital to our shareholders and is dilutive to our common shares 
in addition  the dividend rate increases substantially after five years if we cannot redeem the shares by that time 
on january   as part of the capital purchase program established by the us department of the treasury under the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  we sold million of senior preferred stock to the department of the treasury 
we also issued to the department of the treasury a warrant to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at per share 
the terms of the transaction with the department of the treasury limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares 
for three years after issuance or until the department of the treasury no longer holds any preferred shares  we will not be able to increase our dividends above the most recent level before october  
per common share on a quarterly basis nor repurchase any of our shares without the department of the treasury s approval with limited exceptions  most significantly purchases in connection with benefit plans 
also  we will not be able to pay any dividends at all unless we are current on our dividend payments on the preferred shares 
these restrictions  as well as the dilutive impact of the warrant  may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
unless we are able to redeem the preferred stock during the first five years  the dividends on this capital will increase substantially at that point  from approximately million annually to approximately million annually 
depending on market conditions and our financial performance at the time  this increase in dividends could significantly impact our capital and liquidity 
the us department of the treasury has the unilateral ability to change some of the restrictions imposed on us by virtue of our sale of securities to it 
our agreement with the us department of the treasury under which it purchased our securities imposes restrictions on our conduct of our business  including restrictions related to our payment of dividends and repurchase of our stock and related to our executive compensation and governance 
the us department of the treasury has the right under this agreement to unilaterally amend it to the extent required to comply with any future changes in federal statutes 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of amended provisions of eesa relating to compensation and governance as they affect companies that have sold securities to the us department of the treasury 
in some cases  these amendments require action by the us department of the treasury to implement them 
these amendments could have an adverse impact on the conduct of our business  as could additional amendments in the future that impose further requirements or amend existing requirements

currently  the bank must obtain the written consent of its primary regulators before declaring or paying any future dividends to the corporation 
in addition to this current restriction  various banking laws applicable to the bank limit the payment of dividends to us 
a kentucky chartered bank may declare a dividend of an amount of the bank s net profits as the board deems appropriate 
the approval of the kdfi is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of preferred stock or debt

this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview over the past several years we have focused on enhancing and expanding our retail and commercial banking network in our core markets as well as establishing our presence in the louisville market 
our core markets  where we have a combined market share  have become increasingly competitive as several new banks have entered those markets during the past few years 
in order to protect and grow our market share  we are replacing existing branches with newer  enhanced facilities and anticipate constructing new facilities over the next few years 
in addition to the enhancement and expansion in our core markets  we have been increasing our presence in the louisville market 
our acquisition of fsb bancshares  inc has broadened our retail branch network in the louisville market  which now extends into southern indiana 
approximately of the deposit base in the louisville market is controlled by five out of state banks 
while the market is very competitive  we believe this creates an opportunity for smaller community banks with more power to make decisions locally 
we believe our investment in these initiatives along with our continued commitment to a high level of customer service will enhance our market share in our core markets and our development in the louisville market 
our retail branch network continues to generate encouraging results 
total deposits have grown over the past three years 
total deposits were billion at december   an increase of million from december  after our acquisition of farmers state bank in  our retail branch network in the louisville market has broadened to sixteen offices 
in may  we opened the fort knox banking center  our twenty first banking center  which expanded our current footprint in hardin county  kentucky 
the fort knox banking center complements our existing branch located in radcliff  kentucky and is located just outside the main entrance to the fort knox military base 
we also completed the construction of our twenty second banking center which opened in july the branch is located in the middletown area of louisville  kentucky 
competition for deposits continues to be challenging in all of the markets we serve 
we believe this intense competition combined with continued re pricing of variable rate loans could add to additional margin compression

competition for deposits continues to be challenging in all of the markets we serve 
we believe this intense competition combined with continued re pricing of variable rate loans could add to additional margin compression 
we have developed a strong commercial real estate niche in our markets 
we have an experienced team of bankers who focus on providing service and convenience to our customers 
it is quite common for our bankers to close loans at a customer s place of business or even the customer s personal residence 
this high level of service has been well received in our louisville market  which is dominated by regional banks 
to further develop our commercial banking relationships in louisville  we opened a private banking office in april this upscale facility complements our full service centers in louisville by attracting commercial deposit relationships in conjunction with our commercial lending relationships 
our emphasis on commercial lending generated growth in the total loan portfolio and growth in commercial loans over the past three years 
commercial loans were million at december   an increase of million  or from december  the results include goodwill impairment of million related to the january acquisition of bullitt federal savings bank  the july acquisition of three bank one corporation branches and the june acquisition of fsb bancshares  inc 
this impairment loss reflects the results of our impairment testing due to declining market conditions 
while this charge flows through our income statement  it is a non cash item that does not impact our liquidity or adversely affect regulatory or tangible capital ratios 
despite the continued adverse economic conditions during  the corporation s capital position remained well capitalized as defined by regulatory standards 
our capital position was further bolstered in the first quarter of by our participation in the us treasury department capital purchase program cpp 
under the cpp  we sold million of cumulative perpetual preferred shares to the us treasury in a transaction that closed on january  we believe that the current adverse economic conditions will be long lasting 
during the last quarter of  the continued economic slowdown moved to sectors not previously impacted  including consumer  commercial  industrial among others 
credit issues are broadening in these sectors and economic recovery is most likely several quarters away 
we will continue to monitor credit quality very closely in as this recession persists 
as the economy and the financial sector continue to struggle  probable losses in the loan portfolio could increase  resulting in higher provision for loan losses during critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses is critical to the understanding of our results of operations since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
our allowance for loan loss review committee  which is comprised of senior officers  evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
we estimate the allowance using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses based in part on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial real estate portfolio depend more on credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was our estimate of probable losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate resulted in a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million for the period 
if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from those assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could be materially increased 
goodwill and other intangible assets costs in excess of the estimated fair value of identified assets acquired through purchase transactions are recorded as an asset 
an annual impairment analysis is required to be performed to determine if the asset is impaired and needs to be written down to its fair value 
this assessment is conducted annually or more frequently if conditions warrant 
in making these impairment analyses  management must make subjective assumptions regarding the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
it is possible that these judgments may change over time as market conditions or our strategies change  and these changes may cause us to record impairment changes to adjust the goodwill to its estimated fair value 
based on the december  analysis  an impairment of million was identified 
the impairment charge is a non cash item that does not impact our liquidity or adversely affect regulatory or tangible capital ratios 
impairment of investment securities we review all unrealized losses on our investment securities to determine whether the losses are other than temporary 
we evaluate our investment securities on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant  to determine whether a decline in their value below amortized cost is other than temporary 
we evaluate a number of factors including  but not limited to valuation estimates provided by investment brokers  how much fair value has declined below amortized cost  how long the decline in fair value has existed  the financial condition of the issuer  significant rating agency changes on the issuer  and management s assessment that we do not intend to sell or will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the possibility for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
real estate owned the estimation of fair value is significant to real estate owned acquired through foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure 
fair value is based on the appraised market value of the property based on sales of similar assets when available 
the fair value may be subsequently reduced if the estimated fair value declines below the original appraised value 
results of operation net loss for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to net income of million or per diluted common share for the same period in earnings decreased for compared to due to a decrease in our net interest margin  an increase in provision for loan loss expense  write downs taken on investment securities that were other than temporarily impaired  write downs taken on real estate acquired through foreclosure  higher fdic insurance premiums  a goodwill impairment charge and higher operating expenses 
net income available to common shareholders was also impacted by dividends paid on preferred shares 
our book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december  net income for the period ended december  was million or per diluted common share compared to million or per diluted common share for the same period in earnings decreased for compared to due to a decrease in our net interest margin  an increase in provision for loan loss expense  a higher level of non interest expense related to our expansion efforts  a write down taken on investment securities that were other than temporarily impaired and a write down on real estate acquired through foreclosure 
our book value per common share decreased from at december  to at december  net income for generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
net interest income the principal source of our revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as changes in market interest rates 
the growth in our commercial loan portfolio has increased net interest income 
the increase in the volume of interest earning assets increased net interest income by million for compared to a year ago 
average interest earning assets increased million for compared to despite the increase in interest earning assets  our net interest margin realized a modest decline of twelve basis points 
the yield on earning assets averaged for compared to an average yield on earning assets of for the same period in this decrease was offset by a decrease in our cost of funds 
net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets decreased to for compared to for the period 
our cost of funds averaged for the period compared to an average cost of funds of for the same period in going forward  our cost of funds is expected to continue to decrease as certificates of deposit re price and roll off into new certificates of deposit at lower interest rates 
our net interest margin is likely to compress in future quarters as a result of the fomc decreasing the federal funds rate by basis points since september the current federal funds rate is a range of to 
correspondingly  variable rate loans that are tied to the prime rate are immediately re priced downward when the prime rate decreases 
however  interest rates paid on customer deposits  which are priced off of the london interbank offering rate libor  have not adjusted downward proportionately with the declining interest yields on loans and investments 
libor  which is a market driven rate  did not decline in rate as much as the prime rate 
therefore  we do not expect our deposit costs to decline as fast as our yield on loans 
fifty eight percent of deposits are time deposits that re price over a longer period of time 
this difference in the timing of the re pricing of our assets and deposits is expected to continue to lower our net interest margin

prevailing mortgage interest rates remained at attractive levels during helping to contribute to the increase in the volume of loans closed for we invest in various types of liquid assets  including united states treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  mutual funds  stocks and others 
during we recorded a gain on sale of investments of  gains on investment securities are infrequent and are not a consistent recurring core source of income 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  for the expected credit loss during the period on all five of our trust preferred securities 
management believes this impairment was primarily attributable to the current economic environment which caused the financial conditions of some of the issuers to deteriorate 
during  we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  on certain equity securities with a cost basis of  further reducing non interest income for the period was a or  write down of the carrying value of real estate owned properties that had been held for twelve months 
other income increased year to date as a result of gains recorded on the sale of a real estate acquired through foreclosure properties and loan underwriter fees due to increased loan demand

increases for were due to inflationary salary increases  higher costs of benefits and to additional associates hired related to our expansion efforts 
these associates were hired for a new bullitt county retail branch facility that opened in august  a new hardin county retail branch facility that opened in may  a new louisville retail branch facility that opened in july and to fill other positions to support our growth 
we also added twenty additional associates in the second quarter of as a result of the acquisition in southern indiana 
office occupancy expense and equipment and marketing and advertising increased due to additional operating expenses related to our expansion efforts 
we have opened two full service banking centers at fort knox and in the middletown area of jefferson county since may the fdic implemented a five basis point emergency special assessment on insured depository institutions as of june  the special assessment was paid on september  this assessment resulted in a cost of  and is reflected in our income statement for the interim rule also authorizes the fdic to impose an additional emergency assessment of up to basis points in respect to deposits for quarters ended after june  if necessary to maintain public confidence in federal deposit insurance 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the fdic approved that all banks prepay three and a quarter years worth of fdic assessments on december  the prepayment is based on average third quarter deposits 
the prepaid amount will be amortized over the prepayment period 
our prepayment was million of which  was reflected in our income statement related to the fourth quarter premium 
given the enacted increases in assessments for insured financial institutions in  we anticipate that fdic assessments on deposits will have a significantly greater impact upon operating expenses for the next few years 
the second largest expense incurred in was a goodwill impairment charge of million 
annual analysis of goodwill indicated an impairment charge was necessary due to continued market deterioration 
while this charge flows through our income statement  it is a non cash item that does not impact our liquidity or adversely affect regulatory or tangible capital ratios 
other expense increased due to increases in interchange expense  postage and courier  loan expenses  reo expense and other operating expenses 
interchange expense increased due to the switch to real time debit card processing  which is more expensive per item than the batch processing method we used previously 
reo expense relating to repair  maintenance and taxes increased due to increases in real estate we acquired through foreclosure 
our efficiency ratio  excluding goodwill impairment  was for compared to for the period 
the increase principally reflects our recent expansion efforts 
income taxes the effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the tax rate is related primarily to the loss generated from the goodwill impairment as a portion of this goodwill arose from a taxable business combination 
other factors which present a favorable tax rate are income from tax free loans  tax exempt income on state and municipal securities  and income on bank owned life insurance  which is not taxable 
analysis of financial condition total assets at december  increased to billion compared to billion at december  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in loans of million and an increase in investment securities of million 
total loans have increased during and have been increasing substantially over the past several years 
we expect this growth rate to slow in the next few years 
offsetting this increase was the million write down of goodwill 
the growth in loans and investment securities was funded with deposits  which increased million for the period 
the increase in deposits was also used to pay down our short term borrowings 
loans net loans increased million to million at december  compared to million at december  our commercial real estate portfolio increased million to million at december  real estate construction loans decreased due to the economic slow down while our residential mortgage loan  consumer  home equity and indirect consumer portfolios all increased for the period 
for  we believe the growth in commercial real estate loans may not continue at the rate experienced over the last few years due to the current economic slow down 
however  we also believe we will be well positioned to benefit from growth in our local markets when the economy rebounds

an increase in loan charge offs or non performing loans or an inadequate allowance for loan losses could reduce net interest income  net income and capital and limit the range of products and services we can offer 
the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses quarterly to maintain a level sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the committee determines the allowance by applying loss estimates to graded loans by categories  as described below 
in addition  the committee analyzes such factors as changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations 
was a tumultuous year for the us economy and the financial service industry 
declining property values led to declining valuations for loan portfolios 
the property value declines  which began in the second half of  continued throughout the markets we serve have generally avoided the severe property value declines experienced in other parts of the country  nonetheless  the impact in our markets was still significant 
during the second half of and throughout  we substantially increased our provision for loan losses for our general and specific reserves as adverse conditions were identified 
will continue to be a challenging time for our financial institution as we manage the overall level of our credit quality 
it is likely that provision for loan losses will remain elevated in the near term

during the fourth quarter of  we added specific reserves to several large commercial real estate relationships based on updated appraisals of the underlying collateral 
the higher provision was also due to our increasing the general reserve factors for commercial real estate loans during the period as the level of classified loans has increased sharply since the allowance for loan losses increased million to million from december  to december  the increase was due to an increase in net loans for  as well as the provision recorded to reflect a million increase in classified loans for the period 
the increase in charge offs for the period was primarily attributed to a charge down of million on one large commercial real estate relationship that we foreclosed on during the second quarter of million of the million charge down was previously reserved during the prior year 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we took a write down of  on a commercial real estate relationship that was classified and recorded a charge off of  on another commercial real estate relationship 
additionally  charge offs were generally higher in all areas of the loan portfolio for the provision for loan losses increased by million to million in compared to the increase was related to a million specific reserve for a classified commercial real estate development loan 
this relationship had been previously classified during the first quarter of we also recorded a million specific reserve on a commercial real estate relationship during the fourth quarter of the reserve was increased based on an updated appraisal of the underlying collateral 
the increase in the provision was also related to strong loan growth in the overall portfolio as well as from specific reserves on several other commercial real estate relationships 
the provision for the period was smaller due to the improved performance of one of our credit relationships  which reduced the allowance allocated to the loan 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million from december  to december  the increase included the addition of  as a result of the fsb bancshares  inc acquisition  an increase in net loans for  as well as the provision recorded to reflect a million increase in classified loans for the period 
the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors

if economic conditions continue to put stress on our borrowers going forward  this may result in higher provisions for loan losses 
we expect that the economy will remain weak at least for the next several quarters 
credit quality will continue to be a primary focus in and going forward 
the million increase in substandard assets for was primarily the result of downgrading loans with eleven borrowers with balances ranging from  to million 
offsetting this increase was the transfer of a classified loan having a balance of million to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
approximately million of the total classified loans were related to real estate development or real estate construction loans in our market area 
classified consumer loans totaled million  classified mortgage loans totaled million and classified commercial loans totaled million 
for more information on collection efforts  evaluation of collateral and how loss amounts are estimated  see non performing assets  below 
although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for active charge offs 
we develop our allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates represent a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio  which we apply to individual loans based on loan type 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans longer than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired when we no longer anticipate full principal or interest payments in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
if a loan is impaired  we allocate a portion of the allowance so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate  or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from collateral 
we review our loans on a regular basis and implement normal collection procedures when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
we generally charge off consumer loans when management deems a loan uncollectible and any available collateral has been liquidated 
we handle commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies on an individual basis with the advice of legal counsel 
we recognize interest income on loans on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
we discontinue accruing interest on impaired loans when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when we discontinue interest accrual  we reverse existing accrued interest and subsequently recognize interest income only to the extent we receive cash payments 
we classify real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
we classify new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired we record it at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
we charge any write down of the property at the time of acquisition to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense 
real estate owned acquired through foreclosure is recorded at lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure 
fair value is based on the appraised market value of the property based on sales of similar assets 
the fair value may be subsequently reduced if the estimated fair value declines below the original appraised value 
real estate acquired through foreclosure increased million to million at december  the increase was primarily the result of a commercial credit relationship totaling million that was transferred during the second quarter of the following table provides information with respect to non performing assets for the periods indicated

offsetting this increase was the transfer of a non accrual loan having a balance of million to real estate acquired through foreclosure 
these credit relationships are secured by real estate and we have provided adequate allowance based on current information 
all non performing loans are considered impaired 
non performing assets for the period include million in restructured commercial  mortgage and consumer loans 
restructured loans primarily consist of five credit relationships with balances ranging from  to million 
the terms of these loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest and extend the term  thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
the borrowers are currently meeting the terms of the restructured loans 
investment securities interest on securities provides us our largest source of interest income after interest on loans  constituting of the total interest income for the year ended december  the securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings and contributes to the management of interest rate risk 
we have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including short term united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks  bankers acceptances  and federal funds 
we may also invest a portion of our assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
we are also authorized to invest in mutual funds and stocks whose assets conform to the investments that we are authorized to make directly 
the available for sale investment portfolio increased by million due to the purchase of a government sponsored mortgage backed security  two us government agency securities and nine state and municipal obligations 
the held to maturity investment portfolio decreased by million as securities were called for redemption in accordance with their terms due to decreasing rates 
we review all unrealized losses at least on a quarterly basis to determine whether the losses are other than temporary and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant 
we consider the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and whether management has the intent to sell the debt security or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  we may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
the unrealized losses on the state and municipal securities were caused primarily by interest rate decreases 
the contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
because we do not have the intent to sell these securities and it is likely that we will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  we also considered the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and identified no matters that would indicate less than full recovery 
we have evaluated the decline in the fair value of our trust preferred securities  which are directly related to the credit and liquidity crisis being experienced in the financial services industry over the past year 
the trust preferred securities market is currently inactive making the valuation of trust preferred securities very difficult 
the trust preferred securities are valued by management using unobservable inputs through a discounted cash flow analysis as permitted under current accounting guidance and using the expected cash flows appropriately discounted using present value techniques 
refer to note fair value for more information 
we recognized other than temporary impairment charges of  for the expected credit loss during the period on five of our trust preferred securities with an original cost basis of million 
all of our trust preferred securities are currently rated below investment grade 
one of our trust preferred securities continues to pay interest as scheduled through december   and is expected to continue paying interest as scheduled 
the other four trust preferred securities are paying either partial or full interest in kind instead of full cash interest 
see note securities for more information 
management will continue to evaluate these securities for impairment quarterly 
as discussed in note  in early april  the fasb issued fasb asc  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
among other provisions  the guidance requires entities to split other than temporarily impaired charges between credit losses ie  the loss based on the entity s estimate of the decrease in cash flows  including those that result from expected voluntary prepayments  which are charged to earnings  and the remainder of the impairment charge non credit component to accumulated other comprehensive income 
this requirement pertains to both securities held to maturity and securities available for sale 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  with early adoption permitted for periods ending after march  we incorporated this guidance in our review of impairment as of march  the following table provides the carrying value of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated

deposits we rely primarily on providing excellent customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years market conditions have caused us to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of the use of those products on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
in conjunction with our initiatives to expand and enhance our retail branch network  we emphasize growing our customer checking account base to better enhance profitability and franchise value 
total deposits increased million compared to december  the increase was the result of several actions we have taken  including deposit promotions  an increase in public fund accounts as well as utilizing our wholesale funding sources 
retail and commercial deposits increased million during public funds increased million  brokered deposits increased million and we added million in cdars certificates for the period 
brokered deposits were million at december  compared to million at december  to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from these changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins 
we continue to offer attractive certificate rates for various terms to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current rate environment  while protecting the margin 
we offer a broad selection of deposit instruments  including non interest bearing checking  statement and passbook savings accounts  health savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of our deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
management periodically adjusts interest rates paid on our deposit products  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties 
we also offer certificates of deposit with a variety of terms  interest rates and minimum deposit requirements 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively for funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  market conditions continue to significantly affect our ability to attract and maintain deposits and our cost of funds 
the following table breaks down our deposits 
december  dollars in thousands non interest bearing now demand savings money market certificates of deposit total as of december   certificates of deposits in amounts of  or more total million  with million held by persons residing within our service areas 
an additional million of certificates of deposits in amounts of  or more were obtained from deposit brokers and million were obtained from our participation in the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars at december  cdars is a system that allows certificates of deposit that would be in excess of fdic coverage in a single financial institution to be redistributed to other financial institutions within the cdars network in increments under the current fdic coverage limit 
brokered deposits consist of certificates of deposit placed by deposit brokers for a fee and can be utilized to support our asset growth 
the following table shows at december  the amount of our certificates of deposit of  or more by time remaining until maturity

and for and advances from federal home loan bank deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for our general business purposes 
we can also use advances borrowings from the federal home loan bank fhlb of cincinnati to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
advances from the fhlb are secured by our stock in the fhlb  certain securities  certain commercial real estate loans and substantially all of our first mortgage  multi family and open end home equity loans 
at december  we had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb  and the capacity to increase our borrowings an additional million 
the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages  other real estate loans and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided that we meet certain creditworthiness standards

the trust loaned the proceeds of the offering to us in exchange for junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures which we used to finance the purchase of fsb bancshares  inc the subordinated debentures  which mature on june   can be called at par in whole or in part on or after june  the subordinated debentures pay a fixed rate of for thirty years 
we have the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debt from time to time for a period not to exceed five consecutive years 
the subordinated debentures are considered as tier i capital for the corporation under current regulatory guidelines 
a different trust subsidiary issued year cumulative trust preferred securities totaling million at a year fixed rate of adjusting quarterly thereafter at libor plus basis points 
the subordinated debentures  which mature march   can be called at par in whole or in part on or after march  we have the option to defer interest payments on the subordinated debt from time to time for a period not to exceed five consecutive years 
the subordinated debentures are considered as tier i capital for the corporation under current regulatory guidelines 
our trust subsidiaries loaned the proceeds of their offerings of trust preferred securities to us in exchange for junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures 
in accordance with current accounting guidance  these trusts are not consolidated with our financial statements but rather the subordinated debentures are shown as a liability 
liquidity liquidity risk arises from the possibility we may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  at a reasonable cost  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
we maintain an investment and funds management policy  which identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the asset liability committee continually monitors our liquidity position 
our sources of funds include the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  the payment of principal on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds realized from loans held for sale  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding 
we also secured federal funds borrowing lines from three of our correspondent banks 
two of the lines are for million each and the other one is for million 
our banking centers also provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to our competitors or other markets in response to interest rate changes  we have the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
traditionally  we have also borrowed from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we had sufficient collateral available to borrow  approximately  an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
we believe we have the ability to raise deposits  when needed  by offering rates at or slightly above market rates 
in the event the bank would fall below well capitalized status  we would be subject to wholesale funding restrictions as well as interest rate restrictions used to attract core deposits 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase common stock  make selected investments and acquisitions  and service debt 
the main sources of funding for the corporation include dividends from the bank  borrowings and access to the capital markets 
the corporation maintains a loan agreement with a correspondent bank 
as of december   the outstanding balance of this loan was million 
during january  the corporation paid down the outstanding loan balance by  the loan matures on january  and principal and interest of  is due monthly at a rate of prime plus one percent with a floor of 
the primary source of funding for the corporation has been dividends and returns of investment from the bank 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the corporation by the bank without prior approval of the kdfi 
under these laws  the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
as a result of a million dividend in used to finance the purchase of fsb bancshares  inc  the bank needed and obtained partial approval for its dividends 
we currently have a regulatory agreement with the fdic that requires us to obtain the consent of the regional director of the fdic and the commissioner of the kdfi to declare and pay cash dividends 
because of these limitations  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the corporation 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million to the corporation 
capital stockholders equity increased million during  primarily due to the sale of million of preferred stock to the us treasury department under the capital purchase program 
this increase was offset by net loss recorded for the year due to a goodwill impairment charge 
average stockholders equity to average assets ratio increased to at december  compared to at the end of on january   we sold million of cumulative perpetual preferred shares  with a liquidation preference of  per share the senior preferred shares to the us treasury under the terms of its capital purchase program 
the senior preferred shares constitute tier capital and rank senior to our common shares 
the senior preferred shares pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and will reset to a rate of per year after five years 
the senior preferred shares may be redeemed at any time  at our option 
under the terms of our cpp stock purchase agreement  we also issued the us treasury a warrant to purchase an amount of our common stock equal to of the aggregate amount of the senior preferred shares  or million 
the warrant entitles the us treasury to purchase  common shares at a purchase price of per share 
the initial exercise price for the warrant and the number of shares subject to the warrant were determined by reference to the market price of our common stock calculated on a day trailing average as of december   the date the us treasury approved our application 
the warrant has a term of years and is potentially dilutive to earnings per share 
during we did not purchase any shares of our own common stock 
however  the terms of our senior preferred shares do not allow us to repurchase shares of our common stock without the consent of the us treasury until the senior preferred shares are redeemed

these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
four of these borrowings  although fixed  are subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb 
the fhlb has the right to convert these advances to a variable rate or we can prepay the advances at no penalty 
there is a substantial penalty if we prepay the advances before the fhlb exercises its right 
we do not believe these advances will be converted in the near term 
the subordinated debentures  which mature june  and march   are redeemable before the maturity date at our option on or after june  and march  at their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the subordinated debentures are also redeemable in whole or in part from time to time  upon the occurrence of specific events defined within the trust indenture

lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
impact of inflation changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this filing have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation and changes in prices 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  comprised of senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
we also incorporate assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december  and december  given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  their relative pricing schedules  market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
we use various asset liability strategies to manage the re pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within our guidelines of acceptable levels of risk taking 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables  our balance sheet has an asset sensitive position 
this means that our earning assets  which consist of loans and investment securities  will change in price at a faster rate than our deposits and borrowings 
therefore  if short term interest rates increase  our net interest income will increase 
likewise  if short term interest rates decrease  our net interest income will decrease 
our sensitivity to interest rate changes is presented based on data as of december  and december  decrease in rates increase in rates dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points projected interest income loans investments total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base december  decrease in rates increase in rates dollars in thousands basis points basis points base basis points basis points projected interest income loans investments total interest income projected interest expense deposits borrowed funds total interest expense net interest income change from base change from base
