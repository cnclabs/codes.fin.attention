table of contents our contribution to the charitable foundation may not be tax deductible  which could reduce our profits 
the internal revenue service may not grant tax exempt status to the charitable foundation 
if the contribution is not deductible  we would not receive any tax benefit from the contribution 
the total value of the contribution was million  which resulted in recording an after tax expense of million 
in the event that the internal revenue service does not grant tax exempt status to the charitable foundation or the contribution to the charitable foundation is otherwise not tax deductible  we would have to recognize additional after tax expense of up to million 
in addition  even if the contribution is tax deductible  we may not have sufficient taxable income to be able to use the deduction fully 
under the internal revenue code  a corporate entity is generally permitted to deduct charitable contributions in an amount of up to of its taxable income taxable income before the charitable contributions deduction in any one year for charitable contributions 
any contribution in excess of the limit may be deducted for federal income tax purposes over the five years following the year in which the charitable contribution was made 
accordingly  a charitable contribution by a corporate entity could  if necessary  be deducted for federal income tax purposes over a six year period 
our taxable income over this period may not be sufficient to fully use this deduction 
if the deduction is not able to be used we would have to recognize up to million of additional after tax expense 
any future federal deposit insurance corporation special assessments or increases in insurance premiums will adversely impact our earnings 
on may   the federal deposit insurance corporation adopted a final rule levying a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus tier capital as of june  we recorded an expense of million during the quarter ended june   to reflect the special assessment 
any further special assessments that the federal deposit insurance corporation levies will be recorded as an expense during the appropriate period 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation increased the general assessment rate and  therefore  our federal deposit insurance corporation general insurance premium expense will increase compared to prior periods 
on november   the federal deposit insurance corporation adopted a final rule pursuant to which on december  all insured depository institutions were required to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of  and the assessment rate for the fourth quarter of and for was based on each institution s total base assessment rate for the third quarter of  modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on september  had been in effect for the entire third quarter  and the assessment rate for and would be equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional three basis points 
in addition  each institution s base assessment rate for each period was calculated using its third quarter assessment base  adjusted quarterly for an estimated annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of we made a payment of million to the federal deposit insurance corporation on december   and recorded the payment as a prepaid expense  which will be amortized to expense over three years 
we hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future 
if these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future  the book values of these assets would have to be written down and the amount of the write down would decrease earnings 
we are required to test our goodwill and core deposit intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis 
the impairment testing process considers a variety of factors  including the current market price of our common shares  the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions 
future impairment testing may result in a partial or full impairment of the value of our goodwill or core deposit intangible assets  or both 
if an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period  our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment 
however  the recording of such an impairment loss would have no impact on the tangible book value of our shares of common stock or our regulatory capital levels 

table of contents strong competition may limit growth and profitability 
competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense 
we compete with commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage brokerage firms  credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere 
many of these competitors whether regional or national institutions have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide 
our profitability depends upon our ability to successfully compete in our market areas 
we operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations 
we are subject to extensive regulation  supervision and examination by the federal deposit insurance corporation  the pennsylvania department of banking and the office of thrift supervision 
laws and regulations govern the activities in which we may engage  primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance fund at the federal deposit insurance corporation 
these regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities  including the ability to impose restrictions on a bank s operations  reclassify assets  determine the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses and determine the level of deposit insurance premiums assessed  and capital levels to be maintained 
any change in such regulation and oversight  whether in the form of regulatory policy  new regulations or legislation or additional deposit insurance premiums could have a material impact on our operations 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws and applicable regulations are subject to frequent change 
any new laws  rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business  financial condition or prospects 
a legislative proposal has been introduced that would eliminate the office of thrift supervision  northwest bancshares  inc s primary federal regulator  which would require northwest bancshares  inc to become a bank holding company 
legislation has been proposed that would implement sweeping changes to the current bank regulatory structure 
the proposal would  among other things  merge the office of thrift supervision into the office of the comptroller of the currency 
as discussed further under supervision and regulation holding company regulation  federal law allows a state savings bank that qualifies as a qualified thrift lender  such as northwest savings bank  to elect to be treated as a savings association for purposes of the savings and loan holding company provisions of the home owners loan act of  as amended 
such election results in the state savings bank s holding company being regulated as a savings and loan holding company by the office of thrift supervision rather than as a bank holding company regulated by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
if the office of thrift supervision is eliminated  northwest bancshares  inc would become a bank holding company subject to regulation and supervision under the bank holding company act of  and the supervision and regulation of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  including holding company regulatory capital requirements to which northwest bancshares  inc is not currently subject 
continued government action in response to the economic downturn may negatively affect our operations 
in response to the severe economic recession  congress adopted the emergency economic stabilization act of  under which the us department of the treasury has the authority to expend up to billion to assist in stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial system 
although it was originally contemplated that these funds would be used primarily to purchase troubled assets under the troubled asset relief program  in october the us department of the treasury announced the capital purchase program  pursuant to which it intended to purchase up to billion of non voting senior preferred shares of qualifying financial institutions to encourage financial institutions to build capital to increase the flow of financing to businesses and consumers and to support the economy 
in addition  congress temporarily increased federal deposit insurance corporation deposit insurance from  to  per depositor through december  the federal deposit insurance corporation also announced the creation of the temporary liquidity guarantee program which is intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in financial institutions by temporarily guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of participating organizations and providing full insurance coverage for noninterest bearing 
table of contents transaction deposit accounts such as business checking accounts  interest bearing transaction accounts paying basis points or less and lawyers trust accounts  regardless of dollar amount until june  the potential exists for additional federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies have responded aggressively in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  and have issued many formal enforcement orders 
current legislative and regulatory proposals include the following limiting the size and activities of financial institutions  including regulatory capital requirements  establishing a new financial services oversight council  establishing greater government powers to regulate risk across the financial system  and establishing greater standards for and scrutiny of compensation policies at financial institutions 
actions taken to date  as well as potential actions  may not have the beneficial effects that are intended 
in addition  new laws  regulations  and other regulatory changes may increase our federal deposit insurance corporation insurance premiums and may also increase our costs of regulatory compliance and of doing business  and otherwise adversely affect our operations 
new laws  regulations  and other regulatory changes may significantly affect the markets in which we do business  the markets for and value of our loans and investments  and our ongoing operations  costs and profitability 
future legislative or regulatory actions responding to perceived financial and market problems could impair our ability to foreclose on collateral 
there have been proposals made by members of congress and others that would reduce the amount distressed borrowers are otherwise contractually obligated to pay under their mortgage loans and limit an institution s ability to foreclose on mortgage collateral 
were proposals such as these  or other proposals limiting our rights as a creditor  to be implemented  we could experience increased credit losses or increased expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor 
in addition  there have been legislative proposals to create a federal consumer protection agency that may  among other powers  have the ability to limit our rights as a creditor 
if our investment in the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh becomes impaired  our earnings and stockholders equity could decrease 
we are required to own common stock of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh to qualify for membership in the federal home loan bank system and to be eligible to borrow funds under the federal home loan bank s advance program 
the aggregate cost of our federal home loan bank common stock as of december  was million 
federal home loan bank common stock is not a marketable security and can only be redeemed by the federal home loan bank 
federal home loan banks may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could materially lower their regulatory capital 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of a federal home loan bank  including the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero 
consequently  we believe that there is a risk that our investment in federal home loan bank of pittsburgh common stock could be deemed impaired at some time in the future  and if this occurs  it would cause our earnings and stockholders equity to decrease by the amount of the impairment charge

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview historically  our principal business has consisted of attracting deposits from the general public and the business community and making loans secured by various types of collateral  including real estate and other consumer assets 
attracting and maintaining deposits is affected by a number of factors  including interest rates paid on competing investments offered by other financial and non financial institutions  account maturities  fee structures  and levels of personal income and savings 
lending activities are affected by the demand for funds and thus are influenced by interest rates  the number and quality of lenders and regional economic conditions 
sources of funds for lending activities include deposits  borrowings  repayments on loans  cash flows from investment securities and income provided from operations 
our earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  mortgage backed securities and other investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits  borrowed funds  and trust preferred securities 
net interest income is a function of our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the average yield earned on our interest earning assets and the average rate paid on our interest bearing liabilities  as well as a function of the average balance of interest earning assets compared to the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
also contributing to our earnings is noninterest income  which consists primarily of service charges and fees on loan and deposit products and services  fees related to insurance and investment management and trust services  and net gains and losses on the sale of assets 
interest income and noninterest income are offset by provisions for loan losses  general administrative and other expenses  including employee compensation and benefits and occupancy and equipment costs  as well as by state and federal income tax expense 
our net income has decreased over the past few years  totaling for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  much of the reduction in our net income has resulted from increased loan loss reserves and impairment charges on securities caused by deteriorating asset quality  which has affected much of the financial institution industry in recent years 
our provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in addition  we experienced other than temporary impairment charges for securities  which were reflected as a reduction of noninterest income  of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  fdic premiums and special assessments continue to increase because of the growing number of failed financial institutions 
amounts paid to the fdic in the years ended december   and were million  million and  respectively 
lastly  as part of our second step common stock offering in  we established the northwest charitable foundation for the benefit of the communities where we do business 
this contribution of cash and stock resulted in a current year expense of million 
we did not significantly change our underwriting standards in the past several years nor did we add controversial residential loan products 
other than our loans for the construction of one to four family residential mortgage loans  we do not offer interest only mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties where the borrower pays interest for an initial period  after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan 
we also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal  such as option arm loans  where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on the loan  resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan 
we do not directly offer subprime loans loans that generally target borrowers with fico scores of less than or alt a loans traditionally defined as loans having less than full documentation 
however  a portion of the loans originated by one of our subsidiaries  northwest consumer discount company ncdc  consists of loans to persons with credit scores that would cause such loans to be considered subprime 
ncdc has been in operation for over years and has offices throughout pennsylvania 
ncdc offers a variety of consumer loans for automobiles  appliances and furniture as well as one to four family residential real estate loans 
at december   ncdc s total loan portfolio was approximately million with an average loan size of  an average fico score of and an average yield of approximately 
ncdc s total delinquency has remained steady at approximately of outstanding loans  with loans nonperforming for days or more at of loans outstanding 
annual net charge offs average approximately million  or of outstanding loans  and it 
table of contents maintains an allowance for loan losses of million  or of loans 
although loans originated through ncdc have higher average rates of delinquency and charge offs than similar loans originated directly by northwest savings bank  management believes that the higher yields on loans originated through ncdc compensate for the incremental credit risk exposure 
as of december   we held  of preferred stock issued by freddie mac  and million of private label collateralized mortgage obligations  some of which are collateralized by alt a mortgage loans 
as of december   our available credit lines and other sources of liquidity had not been reduced compared to levels from december  or critical accounting policies certain accounting policies are important to the understanding of our financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances  including  but without limitation  changes in interest rates  performance of the economy  financial condition of borrowers and laws and regulations 
the following are the accounting policies we believe are critical 
allowance for loan losses 
we recognize that losses will be experienced on loans and that the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  the type of loan  the creditworthiness of the borrower  general economic conditions and the quality of the collateral for the loan 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses based on all available information 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  including past loan loss experience  known and inherent losses  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  and current economic conditions 
the loan portfolio and other credit exposures are regularly reviewed by management in its determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes a review of historical losses  peer group comparisons  industry data and economic conditions 
as an integral part of their examination process  regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to make additional provisions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management 
in establishing the allowance for loan losses  loss factors are applied to various pools of outstanding loans 
loss factors are derived using our historical loss experience and may be adjusted for factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
commercial loans that are criticized are evaluated individually to determine the required allowance for loan losses and to evaluate the potential impairment 
although management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed previously 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the allowance is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
management believes that all known losses as of december  and have been recorded as of those dates 
valuation of investment securities 
all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at current fair value 
unrealized gains or losses  net of deferred taxes  are reported in other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders equity 
in general  fair value is based upon quoted market prices of identical assets  when available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair value is based upon valuation models that use cash flow  security structure and other observable information 
where sufficient data is not available to produce a fair valuation  fair value is based on broker quotes for similar assets 
broker quotes may be adjusted to ensure that financial instruments are recorded at fair value 
adjustments may include unobservable parameters  among other things 
no adjustments were made to any broker quotes received by us 
we conduct a quarterly review and evaluation of our investment securities to determine if any declines in fair value are other than temporary 
in making this determination  we consider the period of time the securities were 
table of contents in a loss position  the percentage decline in comparison to the securities amortized cost  the financial condition of the issuer  if applicable  and the delinquency or default rates of underlying collateral 
we consider our intent to sell the investment securities evaluated and the likelihood that we will not have to sell the investment securities before recovery of their cost basis 
if impairment exists  credit related impairment losses are recorded in earnings while noncredit related impairment losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
any future deterioration in the fair value of an investment security  or the determination that the existing unrealized loss of an investment security is other than temporary  may have a material adverse affect on future earnings 
goodwill 
goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be tested for impairment at least annually  and possibly more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances arise 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each reporting unit be compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
reporting units are identified based upon analyzing each of our individual operating segments 
a reporting unit is defined as any distinct  separately identifiable component of an operating segment for which complete  discrete financial information is available that management regularly reviews 
goodwill is allocated to the carrying value of each reporting unit based on its relative fair value at the time it is acquired 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires a high degree of subjective management judgment 
we  through the use of an independent third party  evaluate goodwill for possible impairment using four valuation methodologies including a public market peers approach  a comparable transactions approach  a control premium approach and a discounted cash flow approach 
future changes in the economic environment or the operations of the reporting units could cause changes to these variables  which could give rise to declines in the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
declines in fair value could result in impairment being identified 
we have established june of each year as the date for conducting our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
quarterly  we evaluate if there are any triggering events that would require an update to our previous assessment 
the variables are selected as of that date and the valuation model is run to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we did not identify any individual reporting unit where the fair value was less than the carrying value 
deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
using this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments require us to make projections of future taxable income 
the judgments and estimates we make in determining our deferred tax assets  which are inherently subjective  are reviewed on an ongoing basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a reduction in estimated future taxable income could require us to record a valuation allowance 
changes in levels of valuation allowances could result in increased income tax expense  and could negatively affect earnings 
other intangible assets 
using the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions  we are required to record the assets acquired  including identified intangible assets  and liabilities assumed at their fair values 
these fair values often involve estimates based on third party valuations  including appraisals  or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques  which are inherently subjective 
core deposit and other intangible assets are recorded in purchase accounting when a premium is paid to acquire other entities or deposits 
other intangible assets  which are determined to have finite lives  are amortized based on the period of estimated economic benefits received  primarily on an accelerated basis 
if it is determined that the value of these intangible assets has deteriorated  amortization expense may be accelerated which could have a negative effect on earnings 
pension benefits 
pension expense and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  anticipated salary increases  interest costs  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the assumptions are amortized over average future service and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense 

table of contents in determining the projected benefit obligations for pension benefits at december  and  we used a discount rate of 
we use the citigroup pension liability index rates matching the duration of our benefit payments as of the measurement date to determine the discount rate 
our measurement date is december our pre tax pension expense is forecasted to decrease from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ending december  due primarily to the increase in the value of plan assets 
balance sheet analysis assets 
our total assets at december  were billion  an increase of billion  or  from billion at december  this increase in assets was primarily attributed to an increase in cash and cash equivalents of billion and an increase in net loans of million  which were partially offset by a decrease in securities of million 
the net increase in total assets was funded by the proceeds of our second step stock offering of million and an increase in deposits of million  partially offset by a decrease in borrowed funds of million 
cash and investments 
total cash and investments increased by million  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  this increase was a result of the proceeds of our second step stock offering that closed in december and deposit growth throughout the year 
management intends to deploy approximately million of cash and investments into loans over a period of time in an effort to improve operating profits 
the length of time it will take to accomplish this deployment will depend on a number of factors including loan demand  economic conditions and the general level of interest rates 
loans receivable 
net loans receivable increased by million  or  to billion at december   from billion at december  loan demand was strong  with originations of billion for the year ended december  we sold million of one to four family residential mortgage loans originated during the year to assist with our interest rate risk management 
as of december   we have substantially reduced selling one to four family mortgage loans due to our strong liquidity position 
during the year ended december  gross commercial loans increased by million  or  gross consumer and home equity loans increased by million  or and gross mortgage loans decreased by million  or 
total loans days or more past due decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the december  amount consisted of  loans  while the december  amount consisted of  loans 
delinquencies on one to four family mortgage loans increased by million  or  delinquencies on consumer and home equity loans increased by million  or and delinquencies on commercial real estate and commercial business loans decreased by million  or 
like most financial institutions  we experienced an increase in the amount of delinquencies during the past months due to deteriorating economic conditions 
the largest increases in commercial loan delinquencies have occurred in florida and maryland  where real estate values for our loans have suffered the biggest losses in value

this review includes analyzing the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been lower than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer 
in addition  management must assert that it does not have the intent to sell the security and that it is more likely than not we will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis

these investments were four single issuer trust preferred investments and six pooled trust preferred investments 
the single issuer trust preferred investments were evaluated for other than temporary impairment by determining the strength of the underlying issuer 
in each case  the underlying issuer was well capitalized for regulatory purposes 
none of the issuers have deferred interest payments or announced the intention to defer interest payments 
we believe the decline in fair value is related to the spread over three month libor  on which the quarterly interest payments are based  as the spread over libor is significantly lower than current market spreads 
we concluded the impairment of these investments was considered temporary 
in making that determination  we also considered the duration and the severity of the losses 
the pooled trust preferred investments were evaluated for other than temporary impairment considering duration and severity of losses  actual cash flows  projected cash flows  performing collateral  the class of securities we owned and the amount of additional defaults the structure could withstand prior to the security experiencing a disruption in cash flows 
none of these investments have experienced a disruption in cash flows nor are we projecting near term cash flow disruptions 
we concluded  based on all facts evaluated  the remaining impairment of these investments  other than the credit related impairment recognized  was considered temporary and management asserts that we do not have the intent to sell these investments and that it is more likely than not we will not have to sell the investments before recovery of their cost basis

after recognizing the other than temporary impairment  our book value on these three investments was million  with a fair value of million 
we determined how much of the impairment was credit related and noncredit related by analyzing cash flow estimates  estimated prepayment speeds  loss severity and conditional default rates 
we consider the discounted cash flow analysis to be our primary evidence when determining whether credit related other than temporary impairment exists 
the impairment on the other nine collateralized mortgage obligations  with book value of million and fair value of million  were also reviewed considering the severity and length of impairment

asset quality we actively manage asset quality through our underwriting practices and collection procedures 
our underwriting practices tend to focus on optimizing the return of a greater risk classification while collection operatives focus on minimizing losses in the event an account becomes delinquent 
collection procedures 
our collection procedures generally provide that when a loan is five days past due  a computer generated late notice is sent to the borrower requesting payment 
if delinquency continues  at days a delinquent notice  plus a notice of a late charge  is sent and personal contact efforts are attempted  either in person or by telephone  to strengthen the collection process and obtain reasons for the delinquency 
also  plans to arrange a repayment plan are made 
personal contact efforts are continued throughout the collection process  as necessary 
generally  if a loan becomes days past due  a collection letter is sent and the loan becomes subject to possible legal action if suitable arrangements to repay have not been made 
in addition  the borrower is given information  which provides access to consumer counseling services  to the extent required by regulations of the department of housing and urban development 
when a loan continues in a delinquent status for days or more  and a repayment schedule has not been made or kept by the borrower  we may send to the borrower a notice of intent to foreclose  giving days to cure the delinquency 
if not cured  foreclosure proceedings are initiated 

table of contents nonperforming assets 
loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed on a nonaccrual status when  in the opinion of management  the collection of additional principal and or interest is doubtful 
loans are automatically placed on nonaccrual status when either principal or interest is days or more past due 
interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on a nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
when real estate is acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure  it is recorded at the lower of the related loan balance or its fair value as determined by an appraisal  less estimated costs of disposal 
if the value of the property is less than the loan  less any related specific loan loss reserve allocations  the difference is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
any subsequent write down of real estate owned or loss at the time of disposition is charged against earnings 
loans past due and nonperforming assets 
the following table sets forth information regarding our loans days or more past due  nonaccrual loans days or more past due  and real estate acquired or deemed acquired by foreclosure at the dates indicated 
when a loan is delinquent days or more  we fully reserve all accrued interest thereon and cease to accrue interest thereafter

classification of assets 
our policies  consistent with regulatory guidelines  provide for the classification of loans considered to be of lesser quality as substandard  doubtful  or loss assets 
an asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the savings institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible so that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
assets that do not expose the savings institution to risk sufficient to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but which possess some weaknesses  are required to be designated special mention 
at december   we had loans  with an aggregate principal balance of million  designated as special mention 
we regularly review our asset portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations 
our largest classified assets generally are also our largest nonperforming assets 
the following table sets forth the aggregate amount of our classified assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets allowance for loan losses 
our board of directors has adopted an allowance for loan losses policy designed to provide management with a systematic methodology for determining and documenting the allowance for loan losses each reporting period 
this methodology was developed to provide a consistent process and review procedure to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is in conformity with gaap  our policies and procedures and other supervisory and regulatory guidelines 

table of contents on an ongoing basis  the credit administration department  as well as loan officers  branch managers and department heads  review and monitor the loan portfolio for problem loans 
this portfolio monitoring includes a review of the monthly delinquency reports as well as historical comparisons and trend analysis 
on an on going basis the loan officer along with the credit administration department grades or classifies problem loans or potential problem loans based upon their knowledge of the lending relationship and other information previously accumulated 
loans that have been classified as substandard or doubtful are reviewed by the credit administration department for possible impairment 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement including both contractual principal and interest payments 
our loan grading system for problem loans is described above in classification of assets 
if an individual loan is deemed to be impaired  we determine the proper measurement of impairment for each loan based on one of three methods the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the measure of the impaired loan is more or less than the recorded investment in the loan  we adjust the specific allowance associated with that individual loan accordingly 
if a substandard or doubtful loan is not considered individually for impairment  it is grouped with other loans that possess common characteristics for impairment evaluation and analysis 
this segmentation is accomplished by grouping loans of similar product types  risk characteristics and industry concentration into homogeneous pools 
each pool is then analyzed based on the historical delinquency  charge off and recovery trends over the past three years which are then extended to include the loss realization period during which the event of default occurs  additional consideration is also given to the current economic  political  regulatory and interest rate environment 
this adjusted historical net charge off amount as a percentage of loans outstanding for each group is used to estimate the measure of impairment 
the individual impairment measures along with the estimated losses for each homogeneous pool are consolidated into one summary document 
this summary schedule along with the supporting documentation used to establish this schedule is prepared monthly and presented to the credit committee on a quarterly basis 
the credit committee is comprised of members of senior management from our various departments  including mortgage  consumer and commercial lending  appraising  administration and finance as well as our president and chief executive officer 
the credit committee reviews the processes and documentation presented  reviews the concentration of credit by industry and customer  discusses lending products  activity  competition and collateral values  as well as economic conditions in general and in each of our market areas 
based on this review and discussion  the appropriate allowance for loan losses is estimated and any adjustments necessary to reconcile the actual allowance for loan losses with this estimate are determined 
in addition  the credit committee considers whether any changes to the methodology are needed 
the credit committee also compares our delinquency trends  nonperforming asset amounts and allowance for loan loss levels to its peer group and to state and national statistics 
a similar review is also performed by the risk management committee of the board of directors 
in addition to the reviews by the credit committee and the risk management committee  regulators from either the federal deposit insurance corporation or pennsylvania state department of banking perform a review on an annual basis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and its conformity with regulatory guidelines and pronouncements 
the internal audit department also performs a regular review of the detailed supporting schedules for accuracy and reports their findings to the audit committee of the board of directors 
any recommendations or enhancements from these independent parties are considered by management and the credit committee and implemented accordingly 
management acknowledges that this is a dynamic process and consists of factors  many of which are external and beyond management s control  which can change 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates using all the information previously discussed as well as current and known circumstances and events 
there is no assurance that actual portfolio losses will not be substantially different than those that were estimated 
management believes that all known losses as of december  and have been recorded 
management utilizes a consistent methodology each period when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses 
as part of the analysis  management considered the 
table of contents deteriorating economic data in our markets such as the continued increases in unemployment and bankruptcies as well as the declines in real estate collateral values 
in addition  management considered the negative trend in asset quality  loan charge offs and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans 
as a result  we increased the allowance for loan losses during the year by million  or  to million  or of total loans  at december  from million  or of total loans  at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses is discussed above in the section provision for loan losses

effective january   we revised our methodology for calculating the allowance for loan losses 
prior to that date  we established the allowance for loan losses based on ranges applicable to various loan categories as opposed to single amounts applicable to the loan categories  which resulted in our not having an unallocated component of the allowance prior to that date

liquidity and capital resources northwest savings bank is required to maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets  as determined by management and defined and reviewed for adequacy by the federal deposit insurance corporation during their regular examinations 
the federal deposit insurance corporation  however  does not prescribe by regulation a minimum amount or percentage of liquid assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation allows us to consider any marketable security  whose sale would not impair our capital adequacy  to be eligible for liquidity 
liquidity is monitored through the use of a standard liquidity ratio of liquid assets to borrowings plus deposits 
using this formula  northwest savings bank s liquidity ratio was as of december  we adjust our liquidity level in order to meet funding needs of deposit outflows  repayment of borrowings and loan commitments 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet our asset and liability management objectives 
liquidity needs can also be met by temporarily drawing upon lines of credit established for such reasons 
as of december   northwest savings bank had billion of additional borrowing capacity available with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  including a million overnight line of credit  as well as a million borrowing capacity available with the federal reserve bank and million with a correspondent bank 
in addition to deposits  our primary sources of funds are the amortization and repayment of loans and mortgage backed securities  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rate levels  economic conditions  and competition 
we manage the pricing of our deposits to maintain a desired deposit balance 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning and other assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
short term interest earning deposits amounted to million at 
table of contents december  for additional information about our cash flows from operating  financing  and investing activities  see the statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing  and financing activities 
the primary sources of cash during the current year were net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  increases in deposit accounts  and the funds received from our common stock offering 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  which provide an additional source of funds 
at december  northwest savings bank had advances of million from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
we borrow from the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh to reduce interest rate risk and to provide liquidity when necessary 
at december   our customers had million of unused lines of credit available and million in loan commitments 
this amount does not include the unfunded portion of loans in process 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year at december   totaled billion 
management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
the major sources of our cash flows are in the areas of loans  marketable securities  deposits and borrowed funds 
deposits are our primary source of externally generated funds 
the level of deposit inflows during any given period is heavily influenced by factors outside of management s control  such as the general level of short term and long term market interest rates  as well as higher alternative yields that investors may obtain on competing investments such as money market mutual funds 
financial institutions  such as northwest savings bank  are also subject to deposit outflows 
our net deposits increased decreased by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
similarly  the amount of principal repayments on loans and the amount of new loan originations is heavily influenced by the general level of market interest rates 
funds received from loan maturities and principal payments on loans for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
loan originations for the years ended december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
we also sell a portion of the loans we originate  and the cash flows from such sales for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
we experience significant cash flows from our portfolio of marketable securities as principal payments are received on mortgage backed securities and as investment securities mature 
cash flow from the repayment of principal and the maturity of marketable securities for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
when necessary  we utilize borrowings as a source of liquidity and as a source of funds for long term investment when market conditions permit 
the net cash flow from the receipt and repayment of borrowings was a net increase decrease of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other activity with respect to cash flow was the payment of cash dividends on common stock in the amount of million  million and million for the ended december   and  respectively 
at december   stockholders equity totaled billion 
during our board of directors declared regular quarterly dividends totaling per share of common stock

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to positively affect net interest income 
similarly  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to positively affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
our policy in recent years has been to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and by increasing the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets 
we i purchase adjustable rate investment securities and mortgage backed securities which at december  totaled million  and ii originate adjustable rate mortgage loans  adjustable rate consumer loans  and adjustable rate commercial loans  which at december   totaled billion or of our total loan portfolio 
of our billion of interest earning assets at december    billion  or  consisted of assets with adjustable rates of interest 
when market 
table of contents conditions are favorable  we also attempt to reduce interest rate risk by lengthening the maturities of our interest bearing liabilities by using fhlb advances as a source of long term fixed rate funds  and by promoting longer term certificates of deposit 
at december   total interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded total interest earning assets maturing or repricing in the same period by million  representing a cumulative negative one year gap ratio of 
we have an asset liability committee with members consisting of various individuals from senior management 
this committee meets monthly in an effort to effectively manage our balance sheet and to monitor activity and set pricing 
we also have a risk management committee comprised of certain members of the board of directors  which among other things  is responsible for reviewing our level of interest rate risk 
the committee meets quarterly and  as part of their risk management assessment  reviews interest rate risks and trends  our interest sensitivity position and the liquidity and market value of our investment portfolio 
the following table sets forth  on an amortized cost basis  the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are expected to reprice or mature  based upon certain assumptions  in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term of repricing or the contractual term of the asset or liability 
management believes that these assumptions approximate the standards used in the savings industry and considers them appropriate and reasonable

table of contents we have an asset liability committee  consisting of several members of management  which meets monthly to review market interest rates  economic conditions  the pricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and our balance sheet structure 
on a quarterly basis  this committee also reviews our interest rate risk position and our cash flow projections 
our board of directors has a risk management committee  which meets quarterly and reviews interest rate risks and trends  our interest sensitivity position  our liquidity position and the market risk inherent in our investment portfolio 
in an effort to assess market risk  we use a simulation model to determine the effect of immediate incremental increases and decreases in interest rates on net income and the market value of our equity 
certain assumptions are made regarding loan prepayments and decay rates of passbook and now accounts 
because it is difficult to accurately project the market reaction of depositors and borrowers  the effect of actual changes in interest on these assumptions may differ from simulated results 
we have established the following guidelines for assessing interest rate risk net income simulation 
given a non parallel shift of basis points in interest rates a basis point equals one hundreds of one percent  the estimated net income may not decrease by more than within a one year period 
market value of equity simulation 
the market value of our equity is the present value of our assets and liabilities 
given a non parallel shift of basis points in interest rates  the market value of equity may not decrease by more than from the computed economic value of current interest rate levels 
the following table illustrates the simulated impact of a non parallel or upward or or downward movement in interest rates on net income  return on average equity  earnings per share and market value of equity 
these analyses were prepared assuming that total interest earning asset levels at december  remain constant  while million of interest earning deposits will be deployed to other interest earning assets over the next months 
the impact of the rate movements was computed by simulating the effect of an immediate and sustained shift in interest rates over a twelve month period from december  levels 
non parallel shift in interest rates increase decrease shift in interest rates over the next months projected percentage increase decrease in net income projected increase decrease in return on average equity projected increase decrease in earnings per share projected percentage increase decrease in market value of equity the figures included in the tables above represent projections that were computed based upon certain assumptions including prepayment rates and decay rates 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  we cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates 
actual results may differ significantly due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions 
when assessing our interest rate sensitivity  analysis of historical trends indicates that loans will prepay at various speeds or annual rates depending on the variance between the weighted average portfolio rates and the current market rates 
in preparing the table above  the following assumptions were used i adjustable rate mortgage loans will prepay at an annual rate of to  ii fixed rate mortgage loans will prepay at an annual rate of to  depending on the type of loan  iii commercial loans will prepay at an annual rate of to  iv consumer loans held by northwest savings bank will prepay at an annual rate of to  and v consumer loans held by ncdc will prepay at an annual rate of to 
in regards to our deposits  it has been assumed that i fixed maturity deposits will not be withdrawn prior to maturity  ii the significant majority of money market accounts will reprice immediately  iii savings accounts will gradually reprice over three years  and iv and checking accounts will reprice either when the rates on such accounts reprice as interest rate levels change  
table of contents or when deposit holders withdraw funds from such accounts and select other types of deposit accounts  such as certificate accounts  which may have higher interest rates 
for purposes of this analysis  management has estimated  based on historical trends  that million of our checking accounts and million of our savings accounts are interest sensitive and may reprice in one year or less  and that the remainder may reprice over longer time periods 
the above assumptions used by management are annual percentages based on remaining balances and should not be regarded as indicative of the actual prepayments and withdrawals that we may experience 
moreover  certain shortcomings are inherent in the analysis presented by the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of or lag behind changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as some adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
moreover  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
in addition  we regularly measure and monitor the market value of our net assets and the changes therein 
while fluctuations are expected because of changes in interest rates  we have established policy limits for various interest rate scenarios 
given interest rate shocks of to basis points the market value of net assets is not expected to decrease by more than to 
off balance sheet arrangements as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we routinely enter into commitments to purchase and sell mortgage loans
