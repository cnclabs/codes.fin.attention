item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage drug development company that discovers and develops novel  small molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory autoimmune diseases  as well as for certain cancers and metabolic diseases 
our pioneering research focuses on intracellular signaling pathways and related targets that are critical to disease mechanisms 
we have product development programs in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  or ra  thrombocytopenia and asthma  as well as in cancer 
our productivity has resulted in strategic collaborations with large pharmaceutical partners to develop and market certain of our product candidates 
r is our lead product candidate 
in february  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with az for the global development and commercialization of our oral syk inhibitors for the treatment of human diseases other than those primarily involving respiratory or pulmonary dysfunction 
the agreement includes a license of rights to r  our late stage investigational product candidate for the treatment of ra and other indications 
we completed a comprehensive phase clinical trial of r  which is at the most advanced stage of development of the oral syk inhibitors being evaluated for an ra indication 
inhibiting syk is thought to block the intracellular signaling of various immune cells implicated in the destruction of bone and cartilage  which is characteristic of ra 
upon effectiveness of the agreement  az is required to pay us an upfront payment of million  and up to an additional million if specified development  regulatory and launch milestones are achieved for r we will also be eligible to receive up to an additional million if specified sales performance milestones are achieved for r  as well as significant stepped double digit royalties on net sales worldwide of r the agreement is subject to and will become effective upon clearance under the hsr act 
in september  we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
we believe that our existing capital resources  including the upfront payment we expect to receive from az upon the effectiveness of our collaboration agreement with them  will be sufficient to support our current and projected funding requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we have not been profitable and have incurred operating losses since we were incorporated in june the extent of our future losses and the timing of potential profitability are highly uncertain 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  we expect to finance future cash needs through collaboration and licensing arrangements or public and or private equity or debt offerings  as well as through interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
product development programs our product development portfolio features multiple novel small molecule drug candidates whose specialized mechanisms of action are intended to provide therapeutic benefit for a range of inflammatory autoimmune diseases as well as for certain cancers

table of contents research and development expenses our research and development expenditures include costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  stock based compensation  and allocated facility costs 
we do not track fully burdened research and development costs separately for each of our drug candidates 
we review our research and development expenses by focusing on three categories research  development  and other 
our research team is focused on creating a portfolio of product candidates that can be developed into small molecule therapeutics in our own proprietary programs or with potential collaborative partners and utilizes our robust discovery engine to rapidly discover and validate new product candidates in our focused range of therapeutic indications 
research expenses relate primarily to personnel expenses  lab supplies  fees to third party research consultants  and compounds 
our development group leads the implementation of our clinical and regulatory strategies and prioritizes disease indications in which our compounds may be studied in clinical trials 
development expenses relate primarily to clinical trials  personnel expenses  lab supplies  and fees to third party research consultants 
other expenses primarily include allocated stock based compensation expense relating to personnel in research and development groups and allocated facilities costs 
in addition to reviewing the three categories of research and development expenses described in the preceding paragraph  we principally consider qualitative factors in making decisions regarding our research and development programs  which include enrollment in clinical trials and the results thereof  the clinical and commercial potential for our drug candidates and competitive dynamics 
we also make our research and development decisions in the context of our overall business strategy  which includes the evaluation of potential collaborations for the development of our drug candidates 
the following table presents our total research and development expenses by category 
years ended december  categories research development other we have not tracked research and development expenses in these categories prior to our preparation of this annual report on form k 
other expenses above mainly represent allocated stock based compensation expenses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and allocated facilities costs of approximately million for each of the year ended december   and from january  to december   accumulated research and development costs by category are million   and million  for research  development  and other  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  the major portion of our research and development expenses were associated with our two phase b clinical trials taski and taski  as well as the related extension trials in ra patients 
for the year ended december   a major portion of our research and development expenses was associated with our phase a clinical trial taski 
the expenses for these programs are included in development expenses above 

table of contents the following table presents the currently estimated timeline for the next clinical stage related to r in ra 
we licensed the rights to r to az in february pipeline current stage estimated clinical timeline r oral syk inhibitor ra phase completed az completed phase clinical trials in and expect az to initiate phase clinical trial in the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict given the number of clinical trials that we will need to conduct for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps  beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical trials in humans 
each of these steps is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in early stages of development often results in increasing expenditures for a given product candidate 
significant delays in clinical testing could materially impact our product development costs and timing of completion of the clinical trials 
we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time  will need to be halted or revamped or will be completed on schedule  or at all 
clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial  delays from scale up  delays in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms with prospective clinical sites  delays in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a trial at a prospective clinical site or delays in recruiting subjects to participate in a study 
we currently do not have reliable estimates of total costs for a particular drug candidate to reach the market 
our potential products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and may not result in receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
we do not have a reasonable basis to determine when or if material net cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our drug candidates will occur 
commercialization of our product candidates depends upon successful completion of extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy for humans 
we do not know whether we  or any of our current or potential future collaborative partners  will undertake clinical trials of potential products beyond the trials already concluded and the trials currently in process 
it will take us  or our current or potential future collaborative partners  several years to complete any such testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
interim results of trials do not necessarily predict final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
moreover  we or our current or potential future collaborative partners may decide to discontinue development of any project at any time for regulatory  commercial  scientific or other reasons 
to date  we have not commercialized any of our drug candidates  and we may never do so 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and costs of completing the development of the company s drug candidates  see part i 
item a 
risk factors  including in particular the following risks if our corporate collaborations or license agreements are unsuccessful  our research and development efforts could be delayed 
if conflicts arise between our collaborators or advisors and us  any of them may act in their self interest  which may be adverse to our stockholders interests 

table of contents we might not be able to commercialize our product candidates successfully if problems arise in the clinical testing and approval process 
there is a high risk that drug discovery and development efforts might not successfully generate good product candidates 
our future funding requirements will depend on many uncertain factors 
because we expect to be dependent upon collaborative and license agreements  we might not meet our strategic objectives 
delays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us 
for further discussion on research and development activities  see research and development expenses under results of operations below 
recent developments in february  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with az for the global development and commercialization of our oral syk inhibitors for the treatment of human diseases other than those primarily involving respiratory or pulmonary dysfunction 
the agreement includes a license of rights to r  our late stage investigational product candidate for the treatment of ra and other indications 
upon effectiveness of the agreement  az is required to pay us an upfront payment of million  and up to an additional million if specified development  regulatory and launch milestones are achieved for r we will also be eligible to receive up to an additional million if specified sales performance milestones are achieved for r  as well as significant stepped double digit royalties on net sales worldwide of r after a limited transition period  az will be responsible for conducting and funding all development  regulatory filings  manufacturing and global commercialization of products containing oral syk inhibitors 
we are responsible for conducting  at our expense  the on going open label extension study in r during the limited transition period 
the agreement is subject to and will become effective upon clearance under the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  or the hsr act 
in february  merck serono advised us of its plans to return the r aurora kinase program for certain solid tumors and leukemias to us 
the program  which merck serono licensed in  has progressed through phase safety trials 
we plan to evaluate the program s preclinical and clinical data and make a decision on the program s disposition 
equity financing during the third quarter of  we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to terms of our research collaborations ie revenue recognition of upfront fees and certain milestone payments  investments  stock based compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets and contingencies  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
table of contents apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition we present revenue from our collaboration arrangements under financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc   collaboration arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under fasb asc  multiple element arrangements  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of any undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
when a research term is not specified  we estimate the time it will take us to complete our deliverables under the contract and recognize the upfront fee using the straight line method over that time period 
we review our estimates every quarter for reasonableness 
revenues related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators are recognized as research services are performed over the related development periods for each agreement 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in each respective agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
our research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements approximate the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
it is our policy to recognize revenue based on our level of effort expended  however  revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the agreement 
revenues associated with substantive  at risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements are recognized upon achievement of the milestones as set forth in the applicable agreement 
stock based compensation total stock based compensation expense related to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants stock option plans that we recognized for the year ended december   and was comprised as follows aggregate change aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands stock based compensation expense from officer  director and employee options consultant options restructuring charges total 
table of contents we grant options to purchase our common stock to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or of the fair market value on the purchase date under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
the benefits provided under these plans are stock based payments subject to the provisions of fasb asc we adopted the use of the straight line attribution method over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  we estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating compensation costs  then record actual forfeitures as they occur 
we review our forfeiture rates each quarter and make any necessary changes to our estimates 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the lower valuation of options granted in the first quarter of and the full recognition of most of the expense associated with the options granted in january during  as most of those options vested over a one year period 
the increase in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was primarily due to the amortization of expense associated with the january grants which had a higher valuation due to a higher stock price and volatility rate on the grant date 
in february  we announced that we cut our research programs in virology and oncology as well as terminated certain related development and administrative staff  which resulted in the dismissal of employees  or approximately of our workforce 
this measure was intended to maintain our emphasis on our active preclinical and clinical programs  while conserving our resources 
as part of a package we offered the terminated employees  we extended the date the terminated employees had to exercise their vested options to december  rather than days from the termination date as is typically required under our equity incentive plan 
we recorded  of non cash stock based compensation expense incurred in connection with this modification in the first quarter of the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and dividends 
we estimate volatility over the expected term of the option using historical share price performance 
for expected term  among other things  we take into consideration our historical data of options exercised  cancelled and expired 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury constant maturity rate 
we have not paid and do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
in order to calculate stock based compensation expense  we also estimate the forfeiture rate using our historical experience with options that cancel before they vest 
we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the fair value and periodic fair value re measurement of outstanding consultant options under fasb asc the valuation is based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price  risk free interest rate and expected term 
we amortize stock based compensation related to consultants using a straight line attribution method consistent with the method used for employees and with the attribution election we made upon adoption of fasb asc we expect to see continued fluctuations in the expense related to consultant options in the future as a portion of these options are remeasured based on changes in the current market price of our common stock 
research and development accruals we have various contracts with third parties related to our research and development activities 
costs that are incurred but not billed to us as of the end of the period are accrued 
we make estimates of the amounts incurred in each period based on the information available to us and our knowledge of 
table of contents the nature of the contractual activities generating such costs 
clinical trial contract expenses are accrued based on units of activity reported by third parties 
expenses related to other research and development contracts  such as research contracts  toxicology study contracts and manufacturing contracts are estimated to be incurred generally on a straight line basis over the duration of the contracts 
raw materials and study materials purchased by third parties are expensed at the time of purchase 
many of our estimates are based significantly or in part on information provided by third parties 
if such information were not reported properly  our research and development expense amounts could be misstated 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues aggregate change aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands contract revenues from collaborations revenues by collaborator were aggregate change aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands daiichi pfizer merck merck serono total contract revenue from collaborations in of  consisted of a milestone payment from daiichi for the first designation of a rational design lead compound 
there were no contract revenues reported during the year ended december  contract revenues from collaborations in consisted primarily of a million milestone payment from pfizer  a million milestone payment from merck serono and million in full time equivalent  or fte  and license revenue from merck 
fte revenue in from merck was million and the related research and development expenses incurred to earn the fte revenue were million 
these expenses are presented as part of research and development expenses 
the increase in revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the similar period in  was due to the recognition of the milestone payment from daiichi in december the decrease in revenues in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to the absence of contract revenues reported in as discussed above 
we had no deferred revenue as of december  our potential future revenues may include certain upfront and milestone payments from our current collaboration partners or new collaboration partners we enter into agreements with in the future 

table of contents research and development expenses aggregate change aggregate change years ended december  from from in thousands research and development expenses stock based compensation expense included in research and development expenses the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was primarily due to a decrease in clinical trial costs as a result of the completion of our two phase b clinical trials taski and taski in july  a decrease in stock based compensation expense as discussed under stock based compensation above  and cost savings as a result of the restructuring implemented in the first quarter of  as discussed under restructuring charges below 
the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   compared to the same period in  was primarily due to an increase in clinical costs  as well as stock based compensation expense as discussed under stock based compensation above  partially offset by the decrease in bonus expense in as we did not pay any bonuses for the increase in clinical costs was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with our two phase b clinical trials taski and taski  as well as the related extension trials in ra patients and manufacturing r material to be used in those clinical trials

this measure was intended to maintain our emphasis on our active preclinical and clinical programs  while conserving our resources 
as a result of the restructuring implemented in the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million  including million of workforce reduction costs which had been paid as of december  and  of non cash stock based compensation expense incurred in connection with the extension of the date the terminated employees have to exercise their vested options to december  rather than days from the termination date as is typically required under our equity incentive plan 
interest income years ended december  aggregate change aggregate change from from in thousands interest income interest income results from our interest bearing cash and investment balances 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates earned on our investments in the net proceeds of our underwritten public offering of approximately million were received at the end of september and therefore did not significantly impact interest income for the whole year 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  was due to lower interest rates earned on our investments in as compared to interest expense years ended december  aggregate change aggregate change from from in thousands interest expense interest expense primarily results from our capital lease obligations associated with fixed asset acquisitions

formerly emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
on asc for revenue recognition related to 
table of contents multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the asu provides amendments to the existing criteria for separating consideration in multiple deliverable arrangements 
the amendments establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  eliminate the residual method of allocation of arrangement consideration to all deliverables and require the use of the relative selling price method in allocation of arrangement consideration to all deliverables  require the determination of the best estimate of a selling price in a consistent manner  and significantly expand the disclosures related to the multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
the amendments will be effective in fiscal years beginning on or after june   and early adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact on our financial statements of adopting these amendments to asc and cannot estimate the impact of adoption at this time 
on july   the fasb launched the fasb accounting standards codification  or the codification  as the single source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb 
the codification reorganizes various us gaap pronouncements into accounting topics and displays them using a consistent structure 
all existing accounting standards documents are superseded as described in sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles which is now part of fasb asc all of the contents of the codification carry the same level of authority  effectively superseding sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles  which identified and ranked the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in preparing financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
also included in the codification  as a reference for public companies  are rules and interpretive releases of the us securities and exchange commission  or the sec  under authority of federal securities laws which are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  we adopted sfas no 
on july  and concluded it had no material impact on our financial statements other than changing the way specific accounting standards are referenced in our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date as we continue our research and development activities  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
in september  we completed an underwritten public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
in february  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with az for the global development and commercialization of our oral syk inhibitors for the treatment of human diseases other than those primarily involving respiratory or pulmonary dysfunction 
upon effectiveness of the agreement  az is required to pay us an upfront payment of million  and up to an additional million if specified development  regulatory and launch milestones are achieved for r we will also be eligible to receive up to an additional million if specified sales performance milestones are achieved for r  as well as significant stepped double digit royalties on net sales worldwide of r as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to approximately million as of december   a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the operating expenses for the year ended december   offset by net proceeds of approximately million from our public offering in the third quarter of we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to support our current and projected funding requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could 
table of contents utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates and other research and development activities  including risks and uncertainties that could impact the rate of progress of our development activities  we are unable to estimate with certainty the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials and other research and development activities 
our operations will require significant additional funding for the foreseeable future 
until we are able to generate a sufficient amount of product revenue  we expect to finance future cash needs through public and or private equity offerings  debt financings or collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on the investment of our cash balances and short term investments 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders could at that time experience substantial dilution 
any debt financing that we are able to obtain may involve operating covenants that restrict our business 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some of our rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and success of clinical trials and preclinical activities including studies and manufacture of materials of our product candidates conducted by us or our collaborative partners or licensees  our ability to establish new collaborations  including the terms thereof  and to meet our obligations under our existing collaboration partnerships  the progress of research programs carried out by us  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments to us from our collaboration partners  the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborative partners  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals and filings by us and our collaborators  and expenses associated with the pending and potential additional related purported securities class action lawsuits  as well as any unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
for the year ended december  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  us treasury bills  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and commercial paper 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 

table of contents cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in operating activities in compared with was primarily due to the decrease in cash payments related to our research and development programs 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in compared with was primarily due to the increase in cash payments related to our research and development programs 
the timing of cash requirements may vary from period to period depending on our research and development activities  including our planned preclinical and clinical trials  and future requirements to establish commercial capabilities for any products that we may develop 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities in compared with related primarily to purchases of short term investments of approximately million  partially offset by maturities of short term investments of approximately million and sale of available for sale securities of approximately million

capital expenditures were  in compared to million in and  in net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in  and were mainly due to the public offerings we completed in those years 
in the third quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
in the second quarter of  we completed a public offering in which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities also included proceeds from the exercise of outstanding options and the issuance of shares under our espp of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we did not have proceeds from capital lease financing in compared to million and  in and  respectively 
payments on capital lease obligations for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended that create potential material risks for us and that are not recognized on our balance sheets 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   which only consists of capital lease and facility lease obligations in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations facilities lease total as of december   we had approximately million in capital lease obligations including the interest portion associated with our equipment 
all existing capital lease agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest at rates between and and are due in monthly installments through on march   we amended our build to suit lease agreement to defer certain rental obligations in the aggregate amount of million  for a period of up to seventeen months 
under the terms of this amendment  we were obligated to repay the deferred amounts  including interest accruing at during the deferral period  based on a timeline that could vary depending upon the occurrence of certain financing or collaborative transactions 
in september  we completed an underwritten public offering and received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
as a result of the above financing  we paid our landlord million  or of the deferred rental amounts  plus interest at in november in february  we entered into a global license agreement with az 
upon effectiveness of the agreement  az is required to pay us an upfront payment of million 
we are obligated to pay our landlord the remaining deferred rental amounts  plus related interest  within days after this agreement becomes effective 
the agreement is subject to and will become effective upon clearance under the hsr act 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  u 
s 
treasury bills  government sponsored enterprise securities  and corporate bonds and commercial paper 
due to the primarily short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
in addition  we believe we have no incremental or new risk related to recent credit market volatility 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
