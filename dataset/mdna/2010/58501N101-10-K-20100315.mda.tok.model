the company we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the rapid development of novel small molecule drugs to treat serious diseases for which there are limited treatment options 
our product candidates in clinical development are dimebon latrepirdine  which is in phase development for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease  and mdv  which is in phase development for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer 
our dimebon program is partnered with pfizer inc  or pfizer  and our mdv program is partnered with astellas pharma inc  or astellas 
in september  we announced a collaboration agreement with pfizer  which became effective in october under the terms of the agreement  we and pfizer will develop and commercialize dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
we and pfizer will share the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing dimebon for the united states market on a pfizer medivation basis  and will share profits or losses resulting from commercialization of dimebon in the united states in the same proportions 
outside the united states  pfizer will bear all development and commercialization costs  and will pay us tiered royalties on aggregate net sales of dimebon 
in the fourth quarter of  we received a non refundable  up front cash payment of million pursuant to our collaboration agreement with pfizer 
with pfizer  we have been conducting a broad dimebon clinical development program  including five randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase studies in alzheimer s and huntington diseases 
in march  we reported negative results from the first of these studies the connection trial  a six month study of 
table of contents patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease in the united states  western europe  russia and chile in which patients were randomized to receive dimebon mg three times daily  dimebon mg three times daily or placebo 
patients in the connection trial were not permitted to take any approved alzheimer s disease medicines for a period of days before  or at any time during  the study 
in the connection study  dimebon treated patients did no better than placebo patients on any of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at either dose tested 
dimebon was well tolerated in the connection study  as well as in a separate randomized  double blind  placebo controlled safety study of dimebon  also reported in march  in which patients in the united states and canada were randomized to receive dimebon mg three times daily or placebo and treated for three to six months 
approximately of patients in the safety study were taking one or more approved alzheimer s disease medicines while on the trial 
further analysis of the results from both of these studies is currently underway 
given the negative results in the connection trial  we are currently re evaluating our approach to the clinical development of dimebon for alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
this will be a complex analysis that will encompass scientific  clinical  regulatory and business issues 
we do not know at this time which  if any  of our ongoing phase dimebon trials will be completed  or if pfizer will elect to terminate our collaboration 
if pfizer elects to terminate our collaboration  we may be unable to fund the development costs on our own and may be unable to find a new collaborator  which could cause our dimebon program to fail 
a more comprehensive discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to the development of dimebon  including our dependence on pfizer for the continued development of dimebon  can be found in the section entitled risk factors risks related to our product development candidates under item a of this annual report on form k 
in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with astellas 
under the terms of the agreement  we and astellas will develop and commercialize mdv for the treatment of both late and early stage prostate cancer 
we and astellas will share equally the costs and expenses of developing and commercializing mdv for the united states market  except that development costs for studies useful in both the united states market and either europe or japan  such as the ongoing phase affirm study  will be shared by astellas and by us 
we and astellas will share equally profits or losses resulting from commercialization of mdv in the united states 
outside the united states  astellas will bear all development and commercialization costs  and will pay us tiered royalties on aggregate net sales of mdv in the fourth quarter of  we received a non refundable  up front cash payment of million pursuant to our collaboration agreement with astellas  ten percent of which we paid to the academic institution from which we licensed our rights to mdv with astellas  we are currently conducting a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase trial  known as the affirm trial  of mdv in men with a type of advanced prostate cancer known as castration resistant prostate cancer  or crpc 
we have funded our operations primarily through private and public offerings of our common stock  and from the up front payment and cost sharing payments from our collaboration agreements with pfizer and astellas 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and we expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we continue research and development activities designed to support potential approval of our present and potential future product candidates 
our pipeline dimebon latrepirdine alzheimer s disease 
our product candidate dimebon latrepirdine is in phase development for alzheimer s disease  in collaboration with pfizer 
in march  we reported top line results from our connection trial  a randomized  double blind  six month placebo controlled phase trial in patients 
table of contents with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease  and from a separate patient randomized  double blind  placebo controlled three to six month safety study of dimebon in patients with mild to moderate alhzeimer s disease  or the safety study  approximately of whom were also taking one or more approved alzheimer s disease medicines 
in the connection trial  dimebon failed to show a statistically significant improvement over placebo on any of the primary or secondary efficacy endpoints  and thus did not meet any of the study s efficacy endpoints 
dimebon was well tolerated in both the connection trial and in the safety study 
we designed the connection trial to confirm the results of our first trial of dimebon in mild to moderate alhzeimer s disease  which was published in in the lancet 
in the first trial  in which we enrolled patients in russia with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease  dimebon showed a statistically significant improvement over placebo on all of the same primary and secondary efficacy endpoints used in the connection trial 
thus  the connection trial failed to replicate the efficacy results seen in our prior trial in russia 
we and pfizer currently are enrolling patients in three ongoing randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trials in alzheimer s disease patients  ranging in duration from six to twelve months 
huntington disease 
dimebon is also in phase clinical development for huntington disease  also in collaboration with pfizer 
in july  we announced top line results of a phase study showing that dimebon was well tolerated and significantly improved cognitive function in huntington disease patients compared to those treated with a placebo 
the study  which was conducted in the us and the united kingdom  met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability  in addition  dimebon showed statistically significant benefit versus placebo in cognition as measured by the mini mental state examination  or mmse  a secondary endpoint in the study 
however  dimebon failed to show a statistically significant benefit over placebo in this study on two other cognitive endpoints the cognitive component of the unified huntington disease rating scale  or uhdrs  and the adas cog 
the study results were published in march in archives of neurology 
in july  we enrolled the first patient in a randomized  double blind  six month placebo controlled phase study to treat huntington disease  known as the horizon study 
impact of the negative connection trial results 
given the negative results in the connection trial  we and pfizer are currently re evaluating our approach to the clinical development of dimebon for alzheimer s disease and huntington disease 
this will be a complex analysis that will encompass scientific  clinical  regulatory and business issues 
we do not know at this time which  if any  of our ongoing phase dimebon trials will be completed  or if pfizer will elect to terminate our collaboration 
the negative results in the connection trial had a material adverse effect on our stock price and market capitalization and resulted in pfizer obtaining the right to terminate our collaboration at any time 
under our collaboration agreement  pfizer is responsible for of dimebon development costs for the united states market  and of dimebon development costs for ex us markets 
if pfizer were to terminate our collaboration  these costs would become our responsibility  following a six month transition period after the date of termination  during which pfizer would continue to bear its share of development costs 
the negative connection results thus may have materially adverse effects on our business and financial position  including on our ability to enroll  successfully complete and fund our ongoing dimebon clinical trials  especially if pfizer elects to terminate our collaboration 
a more comprehensive discussion of the risks and uncertainties related to the development of dimebon  including our dependence on pfizer for the continued development of dimebon  can be found in the section entitled risk factors risks related to our product development candidates under item a of this annual report on form k 
mdv our product candidate mdv is in phase development for castration resistant prostate cancer  in collaboration with astellas 
in june  we presented data from our ongoing phase clinical trial of mdv at the american society of clinical oncology annual meeting 
in the men enrolled in this trial  including both men who had failed prior chemotherapy and men who had were chemotherapy na ve  mdv consistently demonstrated anti tumor activity across dose levels and endpoints  as evaluated by reductions in 
table of contents prostate specific antigen  or psa  levels  radiographic findings and circulating tumor cell  or ctc  counts 
in this trial  mdv was generally well tolerated at doses up to mg per day 
in september  we enrolled the first patient in a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase study  known as the affirm study  in patients with castration resistant prostate cancer who have failed prior chemotherapy 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition revenue recognized to date is attributable solely to the non refundable up front payments of million and million we received in the fourth quarter of and  respectively  pursuant to our collaboration agreements with astellas and pfizer 
for a description of the collaboration agreements  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k 
we account for the various payment flows under our collaboration agreements in a consistent manner  as follows upfront payments both the pfizer and astellas collaboration agreements contain multiple elements and deliverables  and require evaluation pursuant to asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements asc 
we evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreements to determine whether we had obligations constituting deliverables under asc we concluded that we had multiple deliverables under both the pfizer and astellas collaboration agreements  including deliverables relating to grants of technology licenses  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development activities in the us in the case of the pfizer collaboration agreement  our management estimated that the period in which we would perform our deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and will be completed in the first quarter of in the case of the astellas collaboration agreement  our management estimated that the period in which we would perform our deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and will be completed in the fourth quarter of we also concluded that our deliverables under each collaboration agreement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting under asc accordingly  we will recognize the non refundable  up front payments from pfizer and astellas as revenue on a straight line basis over the estimated performance period  using the proportional performance model 
estimation of the performance period of our deliverables requires the use of our management s judgment 
significant factors considered in management s evaluation of the estimated performance period include  but are not limited to  our experience  along with pfizer s and astellas experience  in conducting clinical development activities 
given the negative results in the connection study we reported in march  we and pfizer are currently re evaluating which  if any  of our ongoing phase dimebon clinical trials should continue 
this will be a complex analysis that will encompass scientific  clinical  regulatory and business issues 
after this analysis is complete  we and pfizer will be able to assess our respective future approaches to the clinical development of dimebon for alzheimer s and huntington diseases 
we do not know at this time which  if any  of our ongoing phase dimebon trials will be completed  or if pfizer will elect to terminate our collaboration 
if any changes to our ongoing dimebon development plan are made  or if pfizer elects to terminate our collaboration  we may need 
table of contents to adjust our estimate of the performance period under our pfizer collaboration 
we will review the estimated duration of our performance periods under both collaborations on a quarterly basis and make any appropriate adjustments on a prospective basis 
future changes in estimates of either of our performance periods may materially impact the timing of future revenue recognized under the applicable collaboration agreement 
milestone payments under both the pfizer and astellas collaboration agreements  we are entitled to receive milestone payments based on achievement of specified development  regulatory and commercial events 
management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments  and concluded that these events except for a those relating to regulatory activities in europe  development and regulatory activities in japan  and commercial activities  all of which are areas in which we have no pertinent contractual responsibilities  and b the initiation of the second phase clinical trial under the astellas collaboration agreement  an event which management deemed to be reasonably assured at the inception of the astellas collaboration constituted substantive milestones 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that i each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables  ii achievement of each triggering event was subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us  iii each of these milestones was substantive  based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non refundable  iv achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement  v substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  vi the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  vii a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the up front payment and the potential milestone payments  and viii the milestone payments relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
for the contingent payments triggered by events that do not constitute substantive milestones  management concluded that the appropriate revenue recognition treatment depends on whether the triggering event occurs during or after the performance period of the applicable collaboration agreement 
where the triggering event occurs during the applicable performance period  we will amortize any revenue from this event on a straight line basis over the period beginning on the date the event occurs and ending at completion of the applicable performance period 
where the triggering event occurs after the applicable performance period  we will recognize the associated revenue in the period in which the event occurs 
royalties and profit sharing payments under both the pfizer and astellas collaboration agreements  we are entitled to receive profit sharing payments on sales of products in the us and royalties on sales of products outside the us we will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in asc  revenue recognition 
based on those criteria  we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenues  and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved 
cost sharing true up payments under both the pfizer and astellas collaboration agreements  we and our partners share certain development and commercialization costs in the us the parties make quarterly true up payments between themselves to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared development and commercialization costs 
our policy is to account for cost sharing true up payments receivable by us as reductions in expense  and to account for cost sharing true up payments payable by us as increases in expense 

table of contents stock based compensation we apply asc  compensation stock compensation asc  which requires the measurement and recognition of non cash compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our restated equity incentive award plan  based on estimated fair values 
we have applied the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  in application of asc stock compensation arrangements with non employee service providers are accounted for in accordance with asc equity based payments to non employees using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively  which increased our reported research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses during those periods 
these expenses break out as follows in millions year ended december  selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense we calculated these expenses based on the fair values of the stock based compensation awards as estimated using the black scholes model 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions about expected future volatility of our stock price and the expected term of the options that we grant 
calculating stock based compensation expense under asc also requires us to make assumptions about expected future forfeiture rates for our option awards 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share based compensation arrangements previously granted was million  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of several subjective assumptions  including assumptions of expected stock price volatility  expected stock option term and forfeiture rates  and expected risk free rates of return 
if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense could differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current and past periods 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties to provide research and development services to us  costs are expensed as services are performed 
amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service  and may include upfront payments  monthly payments  and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables 
our cost accruals for clinical trials and other research and development activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and contract research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various research and development activities in the on going development of our product candidates  including without limitation  third party clinical trial centers and contract research organizations that perform and administer our clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under these agreements depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  and the completion of 
table of contents portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials and other research and development activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific agreement 
our estimates are dependent upon the timelines and accuracy of data provided by third parties regarding the status and cost of studies  and may not match the actual services performed by the organizations 
this could result in adjustment to our research and development expense in future periods 
to date  we have had no significant adjustments 
operating leases on certain of the operating lease agreements  we may receive rent holidays and other incentives 
we recognize operating lease costs on a straight line basis without regard to deferred payment terms  such as rent holidays that defer the commencement date of required payments 
in addition  lease incentives that we receive are treated as a reduction of rent expense over the term of the related agreements 
accounting for income taxes on january   we adopted asc formerly fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our policy is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
there were no accrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as of december  we had million of unrecognized tax benefits as of december  and we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months 
we maintained a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of december  the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the asc  accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative historic losses represented sufficient negative evidence under asc and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded against us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance

results of operations years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands collaboration revenue percentage increase we recorded million and million of collaboration revenue in the year ended december  and respectively 
the million increase in collaboration revenue was driven by an additional million of collaboration revenues related to our collaboration with pfizer  which became effective in october  and a million increase of collaboration revenues related to our collaboration with astellas  which became effective in october 
table of contents under the pfizer collaboration agreement  we received a non refundable  up front cash payment of million in october this payment was recorded to deferred revenue  which we are amortizing on a straight line basis over the expected performance period of our deliverables under the collaboration agreement 
we currently expect this performance period to end in the first quarter of we recorded million and million of amortized collaboration revenue in the years ended december  and  respectively 
further  we are eligible to receive payments of up to million upon the attainment of certain development and regulatory milestones plus certain additional undisclosed commercial milestone payments 
at present  we are unable to predict the timing or likelihood of such milestone payments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k for further details on our collaboration with pfizer 
the astellas collaboration agreement became effective in october and we received a non refundable  up front cash payment of million in november  ten percent of which we paid to the academic institution from which we licensed our rights to mdv this payment was recorded to deferred revenue  which we are amortizing on a straight line basis over the expected performance period of our deliverables under the collaboration agreement 
we currently expect this performance period to end in the last quarter of we recorded million of amortized collaboration revenue in the year ended december  further  we are eligible to receive up to million in development milestone payments  plus up to an additional million in commercial milestone payments 
at present  we are unable to predict the timing or likelihood of such milestone payments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report on form k for further details on our collaboration with astellas 
there were no revenues in research and development expense year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses percentage increase research and development expenses increased by or million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the million increase in research and development expenses was driven by a million increase in clinical and preclinical study expenses  resulting from our initiation of six phase trials in  an million one time payment to ucla  representing of our up front payment from astellas received in november  a million increase in payroll related expenses associated with increased headcount in research and development of employees in  a million increase in occupancy and other operating costs principally in connection with our higher headcount and expanded research and development activities  partially offset by a million increase in research and development cost true up payments from astellas and pfizer 
under the pfizer collaboration agreement  specified costs incurred by pfizer and us related to the development of dimebon for the united states market are shared by the parties on a pfizer  medivation basis 
costs related to the development of dimebon for ex us markets are borne by pfizer 
the parties make quarterly true up payments to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared development costs incurred by both companies 
we account for development cost true up payments as additions to research and development expense when such payments are payable by us  and as reductions to research and development expense when such payments are payable to us 
for the years ended december  and  the net development cost true up payments to us were million and million  respectively  from pfizer 
under the astellas collaboration agreement  specified costs incurred by astellas and us related to the development of mdv for the united states market are shared equally by the parties  except for costs of clinical trials supporting development in both the united states and either europe or japan  including our ongoing phase affirm trial  the costs of which are borne two thirds by astellas and one third by us 
costs related to the development of mdv for ex us markets are borne by astellas 
the parties make quarterly true up 
table of contents payments to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared development costs incurred by both companies 
we account for development cost true up payments as additions to research and development expense when such payments are payable by us  and as reductions to research and development expense when such payments are payable to us 
for the year ended december   total development cost true up payments to us were million  reflecting costs incurred following october   the effective date of the collaboration agreement 
there were no such payments in prior period 
research and development expenses increased by or million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the million increase was driven by a million increase in clinical and preclinical study expense primarily associated with significant expansions in our clinical development work for both dimebon and mdv  including initiation of the connection trial of dimebon in alzheimer s disease and continuation of our ongoing phase clinical trial of mdv in castration resistant prostate cancer  a million increase in payroll related expenses associated with increased headcount in research and development of employees in  and a million increase in occupancy and other operating costs principally in connection with our higher headcount and expanded research and development activities  partially offset by a million increase in research and development cost true up payments from pfizer reflecting costs incurred following october   the effective date of the pfizer collaboration agreement 
to date  we have been engaged in two major research and development programs the development of dimebon for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and huntington disease  and the development of mdv for the treatment of castration resistant prostate cancer 
other research and development programs consist of preclinical stage programs  primarily our dimebon analog program 
research and development costs are identified as either directly allocable to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist primarily of clinical and preclinical study costs  cost of supplying drug substance and drug product for use in clinical and preclinical studies  contract research organization fees  and other contracted services pertaining to specific clinical and preclinical studies 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs including both cash costs and non cash stock based compensation costs corporate overhead costs  and other administrative and support costs 
the following table summarizes the direct costs attributable to each program and the total indirect costs for each respective period 
years ended december  in thousands direct costs dimebon mdv other total direct costs indirect costs total research and development expenses we did not track research and development expense by project prior to selling  general and administrative expense year ended december  in thousands selling  general and administrative expense percentage increase 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses consisted of primarily payroll and related costs associated with corporate administration and executive management  facilities  marketing and medical science personnel  professional services including legal and accounting services  medical education and other administrative costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of or million in as compared to was due primarily to an increase of million in payroll and related costs associated with increased selling  general and administrative headcount of employees during  a million fee paid to our financial advisor in connection with our collaboration agreement with astellas  and a million increase in patent fees 
these increases in selling  general and administrative costs were incurred primarily in support of our expanded research and development work  and our collaboration agreements with pfizer and astellas 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of or million in as compared to was due primarily to an increase of million in payroll and related costs associated with increased selling  general and administrative headcount of employees during  a million fee paid to our financial advisor in connection with our collaboration agreement with pfizer  and a million increase in patent fees 
these increases in selling  general and administrative costs were incurred primarily in support of our expanded research and development work  and our collaboration agreement with pfizer 
under our collaboration agreement with pfizer  we share certain dimebon related commercialization costs in the us  including pre launch commercialization costs  on a pfizer  medivation basis 
the parties make quarterly true up payments between themselves to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared commercialization costs 
we account for commercialization cost true up payments as additions to selling  general and administrative expense  when such payments are made by us  and as reductions to selling  general and administrative expense  when such payments are made to us 
for the year ended december   total commercialization cost true up payments to pfizer were million 
for the year ended december   total commercialization cost true up payments to us were million  reflecting costs incurred following october   the effective date of the pfizer collaboration agreement 
there were no such collaboration payments in prior periods 
under our collaboration agreement with astellas  we share certain mdv related commercialization costs in the us  including pre launch commercialization costs  on a basis 
the parties make quarterly true up payments between themselves to ensure that each has borne its applicable percentage of the shared commercialization costs 
we account for commercialization cost true up payments as additions to selling  general and administrative expense  when such payments are made by us  and as reductions to selling  general and administrative expense  when such payments are made to us 
for the year ended december   total commercialization cost true up payments to us were million  reflecting costs incurred following october   the effective date of the astellas collaboration agreement 
there were no such collaboration payments in prior periods 
due to the purported securities class action lawsuit recently filed against us  we expect that our legal expenses will increase in since we intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
interest income  net year ended december  in thousands interest income  net percentage change the decrease in net interest income of or million in the year ended december  as compared to was primarily due to lower yields on cash and investment balances 
the decrease in net interest income of or million in the year ended december  as compared was primarily attributable to interest income on lower average cash balances and lower prevailing interest rates 

table of contents other income expense  net year ended december  in thousands other income expense  net percentage change the decrease in other income expense  net of or million in as compared to was due to a payment of million we received in for a securities law violation by one of our unaffiliated stockholders  one time and realized losses on foreign exchange payables of million in income tax benefit expense the following table presents our income tax expense benefit  and effective tax rate for the periods presented year ended december  in thousands income tax benefit expense effective tax rate the income tax expense for was approximately million  which mainly consisted of the federal and state income tax and represents an effective tax rate of 
the effective tax rate for has increased substantially from in to in  was primarily attributed to the current california income tax payable due to the state s suspension of net operating loss  or nol  utilization 
during the year ended december   we accelerated the recognition of revenue related to the pfizer non refundable  up front payment received in for income tax purposes  while such revenue is deferred for financial statement purposes 
due to the suspension of california nol utilization in  we were not able to utilize the nol carryforwards to offset the taxable income in of the million up front payment received from astellas during the fourth quarter of  we recognized million for both financial statement and income tax purpose in the year ended december  the remaining balance of approximately million will be recognized as revenue for income tax purposes in the year ended december  while for financial statement purposes  it will continue to be amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining months 
accordingly  we anticipate being profitable for income tax purposes for the year and may be subject to federal and state income taxes if there are not enough tax attributes such as net operating loss and r d credits to offset the tax liability 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we have incurred cumulative net losses of million through december   and we expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we continue research and development activities designed to support potential approval of our present and potential future product candidates 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we and do not expect to generate product revenue for several years  if ever 
in the year ended december   we generated million in collaboration revenue from the pfizer and astellas collaboration agreements 
all of our operations to date have been funded through the sale of our debt and equity securities  the million up front payment we received from pfizer in october  the 
table of contents million up front payment we received from astellas in november and cost sharing true up payments from pfizer and astellas 
as of december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million available to fund operations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations beyond the next twelve months 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could exhaust our available cash reserves 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including whether pfizer terminates our collaboration agreement which it obtained the right to do any time as a result of the negative results in the connection study  as well as whether any changes are made to the scope of our ongoing clinical development of dimebon as a result of the negative results in the connection study 
pfizer collaboration agreement in september  we announced a collaboration agreement with pfizer 
due to the negative results in the connection study  pfizer has the unilateral right to terminate our collaboration agreement at any time 
we do not know whether or when pfizer may choose to exercise this right

pfizer has a right to terminate the collaboration agreement unilaterally at any time 
in the event of our uncured material breach of the collaboration agreement  pfizer may elect either to terminate the collaboration agreement or to keep the collaboration agreement in place  but terminate our right to participate in development  commercialization other than co promoting dimebon and other activities for dimebon  including the joint committees and decision making for dimebon 
however  such termination would not affect our financial return or  unless we commit an uncured material breach of our co promotion obligations  our co promotion rights
