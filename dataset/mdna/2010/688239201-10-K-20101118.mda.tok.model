the m atv program accounted for nearly billion of the company s sales in fiscal based on its strong financial results  the company was able to reduce debt by more than million during the year and improve its debt to total capitalization ratio to less than see liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  the company refinanced and extended the term of its remaining debt with the issuance of million senior notes in march and completion of a new credit agreement in september while most of the company s non defense markets remained weak in fiscal  particularly in the united states and europe  the access equipment market experienced a modest recovery in the second half of the fiscal year 
in light of continued weak markets  the company has remained focused on cash generation and cost reduction 
the company announced plans over the last four months to consolidate a number of facilities to take advantage of opportunities to streamline production and reduce costs

the swap  which has a termination date of december   effectively fixes the libor based interest rate on the debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at plus the applicable spread based on the terms of the credit agreement at september  
the notional amount of the swap at september  was million and reduces to million on december  neither the company nor the counterparty is required to collateralize its obligations under these swaps 
the company is exposed to loss if the counterparty defaults 
however  as of the date of this filing  the counterparty is a large aa rated global financial institution and the company believes that the risk of default is remote

requirements under blanket purchase orders generally do not become firm until four weeks prior to the company s scheduled unit production 
the purchase obligations amount included above represents the value of commitments considered firm  plus the value of all outstanding subcontracts 
due to the uncertainty of the timing of settlement with taxing authorities  the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of unrecognized tax benefits for the remaining uncertain tax liabilities

the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on equipment and parts sales when contract terms are met  collectability is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
revenue from service agreements is recognized as earned  when services have been rendered 
appropriate provisions are made for discounts  returns and sales allowances 
sales are recorded net of amounts invoiced for taxes imposed on the customer such as excise or value added taxes 
sales to the us government of non commercial products manufactured to the government s specifications  including the fmtv  are recognized using the units of delivery measure under the percentage of completion accounting method as units are accepted by the government 
the company includes amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items in sales only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the company charges anticipated losses on contracts or programs in progress to earnings when identified 
the company accounts for certain equipment lease contracts as sales type leases 
the present value of all payments  net of executory costs such as legal fees  is recorded as revenue  the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales  certain profit is deferred in accordance with lease accounting rules and interest income is recognized over the terms of the leases using the effective interest method 
the company enters into rental purchase guarantee agreements with some of its customers 
these agreements are normally for a term of no greater than twelve months and provide for rental payments with a guaranteed purchase at the end of the agreement 
at the inception of the agreement  the company records the full amount due under the agreement as revenue and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of sales 
sales incentives 
the terms for sales transactions with some of the company s distributors and customers may include specific volume based incentives  which are calculated and paid or credited on account as a percentage of actual sales 
the company accounts for these incentives as sales discounts at the time of revenue recognition  which are recorded as a direct reduction of sales 
the company reviews its accrual for sales incentives on a quarterly basis and any adjustments are reflected in current earnings 
impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets 
the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
the company performs its annual review at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the businesses to which the goodwill relates 
estimated cash flows and related goodwill are grouped at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or  under certain circumstances  a component of an operating segment that constitutes a business 
when estimated future discounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the net assets and related goodwill  an impairment test is performed to measure and recognize the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
impairment losses  limited to the carrying value of goodwill  represent the excess of the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers current and projected future levels of income as well as business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
the company evaluates the recoverability of indefinite lived trade names  based upon a relief from royalty method 
this methodology determines the fair value of each trade name through use of a discounted cash flow model that incorporates an estimated royalty rate the company would be able to charge a third party for the use of the particular trade name 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  the company considers projected future sales  a fair market royalty rate for each applicable trade name and an appropriate discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions 
see critical accounting estimates 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the company enters into agreements with finance companies whereby the company will guarantee the indebtedness of third party end users to whom the finance company lends to purchase the company s equipment 
in some instances  the company retains an obligation to the finance companies in the event the customer defaults on the financing 
in accordance with asc topic  guarantees  the company recognizes the greater of the fair value of the guarantee or the contingent liability required by asc topic  contingencies 
reserves are initially established related to these guarantees at the fair value of the guarantee based upon the company s understanding of the current financial position of the underlying customers and based on estimates and judgments made from information available at that time 
if the company becomes aware of deterioration in the financial condition of the customer borrower or of any impairment of the customer borrower s ability to make payments  additional allowances are considered 
although the company may be liable for the entire amount of a customer borrower s financial obligation under guarantees  its losses would generally be mitigated by the value of any underlying collateral including financed equipment  the finance company s inability to provide clear title of foreclosed equipment to the company  loss pools established in accordance with the agreements and other conditions 
during periods of economic downturn  the value of the underlying collateral supporting these guarantees can decline sharply to further increase losses in the event of a customer borrower s default 
critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management of the company has discussed the development and selection of the following critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosures relating to such estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s trade receivables are recorded 
the company evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected 
additional reserves are established based upon the 
table of contents company s perception of the quality of the current receivables  including the length of time the receivables are past due  past experience of collectability and underlying economic conditions 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  it is necessary to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
the estimate of fair value of the reporting units is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach 
in estimating the fair value  management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows  future revenues  future earnings and other factors 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the rate used to discount estimated cash flows is a rate corresponding to the company s cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate  and is dependent upon interest rates at a point in time 
the company weighted the income approach more heavily as the income approach uses long term estimates that consider the expected operating profit of each reporting unit during periods where residential and non residential construction and other macroeconomic indicators are nearer historical averages 
the company believes the income approach more accurately considers the expected recovery in the us and european construction markets than the market approach 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
it is possible that assumptions underlying the impairment analysis will change in such a manner to cause further impairment of goodwill  which could have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the osv reporting unit experienced a significant decline in sales  operating income and orders for future sales 
the decline was primarily attributable to concerns of osv s mobile medical trailer customers regarding current and future levels of medicare reimbursement for services performed by these customers 
as a result of these significant declines  the reporting unit revised its forecast to incorporate these reductions which resulted in a significant decline in projected fiscal sales and operating income 
the severity of the decline in the updated forecast  the current medicare reimbursement environment and the uncertainty at the time regarding the potential for passage of a health care reform bill  further impacting medicare reimbursement rates  resulted in an interim indicator of impairment of the reporting unit that required the company to perform additional impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets at this reporting unit in the first quarter of fiscal following the impairment testing  the company recorded impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets of million during the first quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed its annual impairment review relative to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets principally trade names 
the company performed its valuation analyses with the assistance of a third party valuation advisor 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  the company derived the fair value of its reporting units utilizing both the income and market approaches 
under the income approach  the company determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
estimated future cash flows were based on the company s internal projection models  industry projections and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management 
for the annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company used a weighted average cost of capital of and a terminal growth rate of 
the discount rate is based upon the currently prevailing market rate adjusted for company specific risk 
under the market approach  the company derived the fair value of its reporting units based on revenue multiples of comparable publicly traded companies 
the sum of the fair values of the reporting units was reconciled to the company s market capitalization as of july  plus an estimated control premium 
this resulted in a control premium of  based on the price of the company s common stock on july  of per share 
to derive the fair value of its trade names  the company utilized the relief from royalty approach 
as a result of this testing  the company recorded impairment charges of million for trade names within the commercial segment 
based on the company s annual impairment review  the company concluded that no goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges were required 
assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are highly judgmental  especially given the severity and global scale of the current economic weakness 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could have produced significantly different results 

table of contents at july   approximately of the company s recorded goodwill and purchased intangibles were concentrated within the jlg reporting unit in the access equipment segment 
the estimated fair value of jlg calculated in the fourth quarter of fiscal impairment analysis exceeded jlg s net book value by approximately  or million 
the impairment model assumes that the us economy and construction spending and hence access equipment demand will show marked improvement beginning in fiscal assumptions utilized in the impairment analysis are highly judgmental  especially given the severity and global scale of the current economic weakness 
changes in estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could have produced significantly different results 
for each additional basis point increase in the discount rate  the fair value of jlg would decrease by approximately million 
events and conditions that could result in the impairment of intangibles at jlg include a further decline in economic conditions  a slower or weaker economic recovery than currently estimated by the company or other factors leading to reductions in expected long term sales or profitability at jlg 
guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
the reserve for guarantees of the indebtedness of others requires management to estimate a customer s ability to satisfy its obligations 
the estimate is particularly critical in the company s access equipment segment where the majority of the company s guarantees are granted 
the company evaluates the reserve based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve is recorded in accordance with asc topic  contingencies 
in most cases  the financing company is required to provide clear title to the equipment under the financing program 
the company considers the residual value of the equipment to reduce the amount of exposure 
residual values are estimated based upon recent auctions  used equipment sales and periodic studies performed by a third party 
additional reserves  based upon historical loss percentages  are established at the time of sale of the equipment based upon the requirement of asc topic  guarantees 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional reserves would be required 
product liability 
due to the nature of the company s products  the company is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
a substantial portion of these claims and lawsuits involve the company s access equipment  concrete placement and refuse collection vehicle businesses  while such lawsuits in the company s defense and fire emergency businesses have historically been limited 
to the extent permitted under applicable law  the company maintains insurance to reduce or eliminate risk to the company 
most insurance coverage includes self insured retentions that vary by business segment and by year 
as of september   the company was generally self insured for future claims up to million per claim 
the company establishes product liability reserves for its self insured retention portion of any known outstanding matters based on the likelihood of loss and the company s ability to reasonably estimate such loss 
there is inherent uncertainty as to the eventual resolution of unsettled matters due to the unpredictable nature of litigation 
the company makes estimates based on available information and the company s best judgment after consultation with appropriate experts 
the company periodically revises estimates based upon changes to facts or circumstances 
the company also utilizes actuarial methodologies to calculate reserves required for estimated incurred but not reported claims as well as to estimate the effect of the adverse development of claims over time 
warranty 
sales of the company s products generally carry typical explicit manufacturers warranties based on terms that are generally accepted in the company s marketplaces 
the company records provisions for estimated warranty and other related costs at the time of sale based on historical warranty loss experience and periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
at times  warranty issues arise that are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company provides for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
it is reasonably possible that from time to time additional warranty and other related claims could arise from disputes or other matters beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
the company s products generally carry explicit warranties that extend from six months to five years  based on terms that are generally accepted in the marketplace 
selected components included in the company s end products such as engines  transmissions  tires  etc 
may include manufacturers warranties 
these manufacturers warranties are generally passed on to the end customer of the company s products and the customer would generally deal directly with the component manufacturer 

table of contents the company s policy is to record a liability for the expected cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects management s best estimate of the expected future cost of honoring the company s obligations under the warranty plans 
the company believes that the warranty accounting estimate is a critical accounting estimate because changes in the warranty provision can materially affect net income  the estimate requires management to forecast estimated product usage levels by customers  in the case of new models  components or technology may be different  resulting in higher levels of warranty claims experience than with existing  mature products  and certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
the estimate for warranty obligations is a critical accounting estimate for each of the company s operating segments 
historically  the cost of fulfilling the company s warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts  labor and sometimes travel for any field retrofit campaigns 
over the past three fiscal years  the company s warranty cost as a percentage of sales has ranged from of sales to of sales 
warranty costs tend to be higher shortly after new product introductions  especially those introductions involving new technologies  when field warranty campaigns may be necessary to correct or retrofit certain items 
accordingly  the company must make assumptions about the number and cost of anticipated field warranty campaigns 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience  the extent of pre production testing  the number of units involved and the extent of new features components included in new product models 
each quarter  the company reviews actual warranty claims experience to determine if there are any systemic defects that would require a field campaign 
also  based upon historical experience  warranty provision rates on new product introductions are established at higher than standard rates to reflect increased expected warranty costs associated with any new product introduction 
at times  warranty issues can arise which are beyond the scope of the company s historical experience 
if the estimate of warranty costs in fiscal increased or decreased by basis points  the company s accrued warranty costs  costs of sales and operating income would each change by million or  and  respectively 
benefit plans 
the pension benefit obligation and related pension income are calculated in accordance with asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets 
these rates are evaluated on an annual basis considering such factors as market interest rates and historical asset performance 
actuarial valuations at september  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by million 
the company s other postretirement benefits obligation and related expenses are calculated in accordance asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  and are impacted by certain actuarial assumptions  including health care trend rates 
an increase of one percentage point in health care costs would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and would increase the annual service and interest cost by million 
a corresponding decrease of one percentage point would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and decrease the annual service and interest cost by million 
the company s benefit plan assumptions are determined by using a benchmark approach as well as currently available actuarial data 
income taxes 
the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of the related net assets 
the company records a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount management expects to realize 
management considers  as applicable  the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
on october   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
asc topic  income taxes 
asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
asc topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and 
table of contents penalties  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with asc topic is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  where the company evaluates whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than likelihood of being sustained  zero tax benefit is recorded 
for tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step  the company performs the second step of measuring the benefit to be recorded 
the actual benefits ultimately realized may differ from the company s estimates 
in future periods  changes in facts and circumstances and new information may require the company to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions 
changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in results of operations and financial position in the period in which such changes occur 
as of september   the company had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling million 
new accounting standards refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards on the company s consolidated financial statements 
customers and backlog sales to the us government comprised approximately of the company s net sales in fiscal no other single customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for this period 
a substantial majority of the company s net sales are derived from customer orders prior to commencing production 
the company s backlog as of september  decreased to billion compared to billion at september  defense segment backlog decreased to billion at september  compared to billion at september  due largely to the company s completion of a significant portion of the requirements under its contract to produce m atvs  offset in part by additional delivery orders under the fmtv contract  which was awarded to the company in august access equipment segment backlog increased to million at september  compared to million at september  due to higher demand for aerial work platforms in north america and increased military orders 
access equipment backlog as of september  and included million and million  respectively  relating to telehandler orders from the dod 
fire emergency segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  due in part to weakening domestic municipal markets in this business that is cyclical later in an economic downturn and the sale of bai in the first quarter of fiscal backlog at september  included million related to bai 
commercial segment backlog decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  unit backlog for concrete mixers was up compared to very low backlog at september  as a result of increased international orders 
unit backlog for refuse collection vehicles was down compared to september  partly due to the timing of orders from several large waste haulers 
reported backlog excludes purchase options and announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed 
additionally  backlog excludes unfunded portions of the fhtv  mtvr  id iq  lvsr and fmtv contracts 
backlog information and comparisons thereof as of different dates may not be accurate indicators of future sales or the ratio of the company s future sales to the dod versus its sales to other customers 
approximately of the company s september  backlog is not expected to be filled in fiscal financial market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
to reduce the risk from changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates  the company selectively uses financial instruments 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for speculative purposes 

table of contents interest rate risk 
the company s earnings exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is primarily derived from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market interest rates 
the company  as needed  uses interest rate swaps to modify its exposure to interest rate movements 
in january  the company entered into an interest rate swap to reduce the risk of interest rate changes associated with the company s variable rate debt issued to finance the acquisition of jlg 
the swap effectively fixes the variable portion of the interest rate on debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at plus the applicable spread based on the terms of the credit agreement 
the notional amount of the swap at september  was million and reduces to million on december  the swap terminates on december  the portion of the company s interest expense not effectively fixed in the interest rate swap remains sensitive to changes in the interest rates in the us and off shore markets 
in this regard  changes in us and off shore interest rates affect interest payable on the company s borrowings under its credit agreement 
based on debt outstanding at september   a basis point increase or decrease in the average cost of the company s variable rate debt  including outstanding swaps  would increase or decrease annual pre tax interest expense by approximately million 
the table below provides information about the company s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations dollars in millions expected maturity date fair thereafter total value liabilities long term debt variable rate us average interest rate interest rate derivatives interest rate swaps variable to fixed us average pay rate average receive rate for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date 
commodity price risk 
the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  including steel  aluminum and composites 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including steel  aluminum  rubber and others which are integrated into the company s end products 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company generally obtains firm quotations from its suppliers for a significant portion of its orders under firm  fixed price contracts in its defense segment 
in the company s access equipment  fire emergency and commercial segments  the company generally attempts to obtain firm pricing from most of its suppliers  consistent with backlog requirements and or forecasted annual sales 
to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 

table of contents foreign currency risk 
the company s operations consist of manufacturing in the us  belgium  canada  the netherlands  france  australia  romania and china and sales and limited vehicle body mounting activities on six continents 
international sales were approximately of overall net sales in fiscal  including approximately that involved export sales from the us the majority of export sales in fiscal were denominated in us dollars 
as a result of the manufacture and sale of the company s products in foreign markets  the company s earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar  as compared to foreign currencies in which certain of the company s transactions in foreign markets are denominated 
the company s operating results are principally exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the european currencies  primarily the euro and the uk pound sterling  changes between the us dollar and the australian dollar  changes between the us dollar and the brazilian real and changes between the us dollar and the chinese renminbi 
through the company s foreign currency hedging activities  the company seeks to minimize the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of the company s products will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
the company enters into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to mitigate the company s foreign currency exchange risk 
these contracts qualify as derivative instruments under asc topic  derivatives and hedging  however  the company has not designated all of these instruments as hedge transactions under asc topic accordingly  the mark to market impact of these derivatives is recorded each period to current earnings along with the offsetting foreign currency transaction gain loss recognized on the related balance sheet exposure 
at september   the company was managing million notional of foreign currency contracts  none of which were designated as accounting hedges and all of which settle within days 
the following table quantifies outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge non us dollar denominated cash  receivables and payables and the corresponding impact on the value of these instruments assuming a appreciation depreciation of the us dollar relative to all other currencies on september  dollars in millions foreign exchange gain loss from notional amount average contractual exchange rate fair value appreciation of us dollar depreciation of us dollar sell euro buy usd sell aud buy usd sell gbp buy euro sell pln buy euro sell usd buy gbp sell usd buy euro as previously noted  the company s policy prohibits the trading of financial instruments for speculative purposes or the use of leveraged instruments 
it is important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would be offset by gains and losses on the underlying receivables and payables
