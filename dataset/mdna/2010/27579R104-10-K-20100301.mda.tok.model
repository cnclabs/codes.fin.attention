item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of east west bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
on november  the bank acquired united commercial bank from the fdic in an fdic assisted transaction 
this acquisition nearly doubled our asset size and contributed million to our total pre tax income for the period from november  to december  a pre tax gain of million was recorded as a result of the acquisition 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in addition  certain accounting policies require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
fair valuation of financial instruments the company adopted financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc previously sfas no 
 fair value measurements  on january  this standard provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance within the three level hierarchy eg  level  level and level 
fair value determination requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
in determining the fair value of financial instruments  we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available 
we do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that 
table of contents market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc previously sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise 
investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
the company performs a monthly analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
the company ensures prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 
for current broker prices obtained on certain investment securities that we believe are based on forced liquidation or distressed sale values in very inactive markets  we have modified our approach in determining the fair values of these securities 
we have determined that each of these securities will be individually examined for the appropriate valuation methodology based on a combination of the market approach reflecting current broker prices and a discounted cash flow approach 
in calculating the fair value derived from the income approach  the company made assumptions related to the implied rate of return  general change in market rates  estimated changes in credit quality and liquidity risk premium  specific non performance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security  as well as taking into consideration broker discount rates in determining the discount rate 
the values resulting from each approach ie market and income approaches are weighted to derive the final fair value for each security trading in an inactive market 

table of contents we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  a credit related impairment loss is recognized in current earnings 
noncredit related impairment losses are charged to other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors we examine to assess impairment include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  an analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we reexamine the financial resources  intent and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in the current and previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the company considers all available information relevant to the collectibility of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making its other than temporary impairment assessment for our portfolio of residual securities and trust preferred securities 
the company considers factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
acquired loans acquired loans are valued as of acquisition date in accordance with asc business combinations  formerly fas r business combinations 
loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration since origination for which it is probable that all contractually required payments will not be collected are accounted for under asc  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality  formerly sop accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
further  the company elected to account for all other acquired loans within the scope of asc using the same methodology 
under asc and asc  loans are recorded at fair value at acquisition date  factoring in credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loan 
accordingly  an allowance for loan losses is not carried over or recorded as of the acquisition date 
in situations where loans have similar risk characteristics  loans were aggregated into pools to estimate cash flows under asc a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single interest rate  cumulative loss rate and cash flow expectation 
the company aggregated all of the loans acquired in the fdic assisted acquisition of united commercial bank in fifty two different pools  based on common risk characteristics 
the cash flows expected over the life of the pools are estimated using an internal cash flow model that projects cash flows and calculates the carrying values of the pools  book yields  effective interest income and impairment  if any  based on pool level events 
assumptions as to cumulative loss rates  loss curves and prepayment speeds are utilized to calculate the expected cash flows 
under asc  the excess of the expected cash flows at acquisition over the fair value is considered to be the accretable yield and is recognized as interest income over the life of the loan or pool 
the excess of the contractual cash flows over the expected cash flows is considered to be the 
table of contents nonaccretable difference 
subsequent to the acquisition date  any increases in cash flow over those expected at purchase date in excess of fair value are recorded as an adjustment to accretable difference on a prospective basis 
any subsequent decreases in cash flow over those expected at purchase date are recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses 
any disposals of loans  including sales of loans  payments in full or foreclosures result in the removal of the loan from the asc portfolio at the carrying amount 
covered loans the majority of the loans acquired in the fdic assisted acquisition of united commercial bank are included in a fdic shared loss agreement and are referred to as covered loans 
covered loans are reported exclusive of the expected cash flow reimbursements expected from the fdic 
at the date of acquisition  all covered loans were accounted for under asc and asc subsequent to acquisition all covered loans are accounted for under asc covered other real estate owned all other real estate owned acquired in the fdic assisted acquisition of united commercial bank are included in a fdic shared loss agreement and are referred to as covered other real estate owned 
covered other real estate owned is reported exclusive of expected reimbursement cash flows from the fdic 
upon transferring covered loan collateral to covered other real estate owned status  acquisition date fair value discounts on the related loan are also transferred to covered other real estate owned 
fair value adjustments on covered other real estate owned result in a reduction of the covered other real estate carrying amount and a corresponding increase in the estimated fdic reimbursement  with the estimated net loss to the bank charged against earnings 
fdic indemnification asset in conjunction with the fdic assisted acquisition of united commercial bank  the bank entered into a shared loss agreement with the fdic for amounts receivable under the shared loss agreement 
at the date of the acquisition the company elected to account amounts receivable under the shared loss agreement as an indemnification asset in accordance with asc subsequent to the acquisition the indemnification asset is tied to the loss in the covered loans and is not being accounted for under fair value 
the fdic indemnification asset is accounted for on the same basis as the related covered loans and is the present value of the cash flows the company expects to collect from the fdic under the shared loss agreement 
the difference between the present value and the undiscounted cash flow the company expects to collect from the fdic is accreted into noninterest income over the life of the fdic indemnification asset 
the fdic indemnification asset is adjusted for any changes in expected cash flows based on the loan performance 
any increases in cash flow of the loans over those expected will reduce the fdic indemnification asset and any decreases in cash flow of the loans over those expected will increase the fdic indemnification asset 
increase and decreases to the fdic indemnification asset are recorded as adjustments to noninterest income 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and chargeoff trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the 
table of contents state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits  loan structure  and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies 
a detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss methodology can be found in management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses 
as we add new products  increase the complexity of our loan portfolio  and expand our geographic coverage  we continue to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio and changing credit environment 
changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the loan loss calculation 
we believe that our methodologies continue to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
this discussion should also be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report including the section entitled loans and allowance for loan losses 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo represents properties acquired through foreclosure or through full or partial satisfaction of loans  is considered held for sale  and is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value at the time of foreclosure 
loan balances in excess of fair value of the real estate acquired at the date of foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses 
after foreclosure  valuations are periodically performed as deemed necessary by management and the real estate is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo below the carrying value are recorded through the use of a valuation allowance by charges to noninterest expense 
any subsequent operating expenses or income of such properties are charged to non interest expense 
if the oreo is sold shortly after it is received in a foreclosure ie  the holding period was deemed minimal  the company substitutes the value received in the sale net of costs to sell for the fair value less costs to sell 
any adjustment made to the loss originally recognized at the time of foreclosure is then charged against or credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses  if deemed material 
otherwise  any declines in value after foreclosure are recorded as gains or losses from the sale or disposition of the real estate 
revenue recognition upon disposition of a property is dependent on the sale having met certain criteria relating to the buyer s initial investment in the property sold 
loan  oreo and note sales the bank is able and willing to provide financing for entities purchasing loans or oreo assets from the bank 
our general guideline is to seek a down payment as a percentage of the purchase price from the buyer 
we will consider lower down payments when this is not possible  however  accounting rules require certain minimum down payments if these new seller financing loans are to be considered accrual loans on our books 
the minimum down payment varies by the type of underlying real estate collateral 
for note sales where we provide financing  in addition to the required adequate down payment  the sales agreements generally call for guarantees or other forms of borrower recourse 
goodwill impairment under asc previously sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level which is the same level as the company s two major operating segments identified in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this 
table of contents report 
the first part of the test is a comparison  at the reporting unit level  of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
in order to determine the fair value of the reporting units  a combined income approach and market approach was used 
under the income approach  the company provided a net income projection and a terminal growth rate was used to calculate the discounted cash flows and the present value of the reporting units 
under the market approach  the fair value was calculated using the current fair values of comparable peer banks of similar size  geographic footprint and focus 
the market capitalizations and multiples of these peer banks were used to calculate the market price of the company and each reporting unit 
the fair value was also subject to a control premium adjustment  which is the cost savings that a purchase of the reporting unit could achieve by eliminating duplicative costs 
under the combined income and market approach  the value from each approach was appropriately weighted to determine the fair value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second part of the test is needed to measure the amount of goodwill impairment 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated and compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill recorded within the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  then the company would recognize an impairment loss for the amount of the difference  which would be recorded as a charge against net income 
for additional information regarding goodwill  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
share based compensation we account for share based awards to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with the provisions of asc and asc previously sfas no 
r  share based payment 
share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we adopted these standards  as required  on january  prior to  we recognized stock based compensation expense for employee share based awards based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted asc and asc using the modified prospective approach 
under the modified prospective approach  prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of these standards apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for awards outstanding at the effective date is recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
we grant nonqualified stock options and restricted stock 
most of our stock option and restricted stock awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting 
the stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date  while the restricted stock awards generally vest in three to five years from the date of grant 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award  which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award 
we use an option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of our stock options which is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these methods used to determine these variables are generally similar to the methods used prior to for the purposes of our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
we make assumptions regarding expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield  and risk free interest rate in determining the fair value of our stock options 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term assumption is estimated based on the 
table of contents stock options vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees historical exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s current dividend payout rate on its common stock 
for the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant appropriate for the term of the employee stock options 
for restricted share awards  the grant date fair value is measured at the fair value of the company s common stock as if the restricted share was vested and issued on the date of grant 
as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share based compensation is discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
ucb acquisition on november  the bank acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of united commercial bank from the fdic in an fdic assisted transaction 
as part of the purchase and assumption agreement  the bank and the fdic entered into a shared loss agreement  whereby the fdic will cover a substantial portion of any future losses on loans and related unfunded loan commitments  oreo and accrued interest on loans for up to days 
we refer to the acquired loans and oreo subject to the shared loss agreement collectively as covered assets 
under the terms of the our shared loss agreement  the fdic will absorb of losses and share in of loss recoveries on the first billion on covered loans and absorb of losses and share in of loss recoveries exceeding billion 
the shared loss agreement for commercial and single family residential mortgage loans is in effect for years and years  respectively  from the november  acquisition date and the loss recovery provisions are in effect for years and years  respectively  from the acquisition date 
the bank purchased assets with fair value of approximately billion in loans  million of cash and cash equivalents  million in securities purchased under sale agreements  billion in investment securities and million of other assets of united commercial bank from the fdic 
the bank also assumed liabilities with fair values of billion of deposits  billion in federal home loan bank advances  million of securities sold under repurchase agreements  other borrowings of million and million of other liabilities of united commercial bank from the fdic 
united commercial bank was a full service commercial bank headquartered in san francisco  california that operated branch locations in the us we made this acquisition to expand our presence domestically  primarily in the state of california 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting formerly the purchase method 
the assets and liabilities  both tangible and intangible  were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the november  acquisition date 
the application of the acquisition method of accounting resulted in a net after tax gain of million 
see note  business combinations  to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 

table of contents overview the company returned to profitability in  with net earnings for the full year of million 
the company s return to profitability came as a result of a pre tax gain of million recorded in the fourth quarter of from the acquisition of united commercial bank in november and despite the year to date loan loss provision of million 
our return to profitability for follows a single loss year in the only loss year for east west in nearly years 
prior to  east west achieved record earnings every year for over a decade  with net income of million in and million in in  we raised a total million  net of costs in capital primarily through the issuance of million in series c preferred shares and million in common stock 
these issuances of preferred and common stock have bolstered our capital ratios well above regulatory minimum as well as well capitalized thresholds for banks 
as of december   our total risk based capital ratio was or billion more than the regulatory requirement for well capitalized banks 
our tier risk based capital ratio of and our tier leverage ratio of as of december  also significantly exceeded regulatory guidelines for well capitalized banks 
our tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was at december   compared to as of december  similarly  our liquidity position has also been considerably strengthened 
at december   we increased our total borrowing capacity and holdings of cash and short term investments to billion  compared to billion at december  as of december   we had billion in cash and short term investments and approximately billion in available borrowing capacity from various sources including the fhlb  the frb  repurchase agreements  and federal funds facilities with several financial institutions 
our combined borrowing capacity and cash holdings represent of total assets and of total deposits as of december  due primarily to our acquisition of united commercial bank  we also experienced an  or billion  increase in deposits during  with total deposits increasing to billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  our continued efforts to deleverage our balance sheet resulted in a lower loan to deposit ratio of at december   compared to at september  and at december  we believe that our liquidity position is sufficient to meet our operating expenses  borrowing needs and other obligations 
non covered nonperforming assets totaled million representing of total assets at december  this is a decrease from million or of total assets at september  and million or of total assets at december  nonperforming assets as of december  are comprised of nonaccrual loans totaling million  oreo totaling million  and loans modified or restructured amounting to million 
covered nonperforming assets totaled million  representing of total assets at december  these covered nonperforming assets are subject to the shared loss agreement with the fdic 
during  we continued to build on measures and initiatives that we undertook throughout in order to identify  quantify  and reduce our exposure to problem loans 
during  we lowered total commitments on land and construction loans by billion  significantly reducing our overall exposure to these sectors of our loan portfolio which have been most impacted by the downturn in the real estate market 
as of december   outstanding balances on land and construction loans totaled only of total gross loans 

table of contents at december   our allowance for loan losses amounted to million or of total gross non covered loans 
in comparison  the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total gross loans as of december  partly as a consequence of the actions that we took to identify and manage our problem loans  we recorded million in loan loss provisions during total net chargeoffs amounted to million during  representing of average non covered loans during this compares to million  representing of average loans during approximately  or million  of the total net chargeoffs recorded during were related to land and construction loans 
the allowance for loan loss increased during the year due to the significant increase in the loan loss provision during  especially during the first three quarters of reflecting our elevated charge off levels as we continue to manage down our exposure to nonaccrual loans  delinquent loans and oreo 
we continued to sustain higher charge off activities and loan loss provision in our land and residential construction loans that were caused by the sustained weakness in the real estate market 
also  as we continued to reduce our exposure to problem loans  we had to sell problem loans which resulted in charges against the allowance for loan losses and therefore increases in our loan loss provision 
however  both the provision and net charge offs peaked in the third quarter of resulting in a lower loan loss provision during the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of given the trend we are seeing in the loan portfolio  it is expected that the provision for loan losses and net charge offs will continue to decrease throughout based on management s evaluation and analysis of portfolio credit quality and prevailing economic conditions  we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate for losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of december  despite a sizeable loss provision recorded during  the company was profitable during the year 
the million net income that we recorded during includes million in loan loss provisions  million in otti charges on investment securities and a pre tax gain of million from the ucb acquisition 
net interest income increased to million during  compared with million in our net interest margin increased basis points to during this compares with during the same period in relative to  our net interest margin during increased primarily as the result of the yield adjustment on covered loans during the fourth quarter of excluding the yield adjustment related to the fdic covered loans  our net interest margin decreased basis points compared to  primarily due to the sharp decline in interest rates prompted by several consecutive federal reserve rate cuts  reversal of interest from nonaccrual loans and increases in our core deposit base 
excluding the non cash otti charges on investment securities  gain from the ucb acquisition  and decrease in fdic indemnification asset amounting to million  total noninterest income increased to million during  compared with million for this increase is primarily due to net gain on investment securities available for sale and loan fees 
these increases were complemented by higher net gain on sale of investment securities and branch related revenues earned during core noninterest income  which excludes the impact of non cash otti charges  as well as net gains on sales of investment securities  loans and the gain on the ucb acquisition  was million during  compared to million during the same period last year 
core noninterest income is a non gaap disclosure 
the company uses certain non gaap financial measures to provide supplemental information regarding the company s performance to provide additional disclosure 
the company believes that presenting core noninterest income provides more

operating segment results we had previously identified five operating segments for purposes of management reporting retail banking  commercial lending  treasury  residential lending  and other 
our strategic focus has been shifting and evolving over the last several years which has influenced how our chief operating decision maker views the company s business operations and assesses its economic performance 
for the bank the chief operating decision maker is the chief executive officer ceo 
specifically  our business focus has culminated in a two segment core business structure retail banking and commercial banking 
a third segment  which is comprised of a combination of our previous operating segments treasury and other  provides broad administrative support to these two core segments 
as a result of this evolution in our strategic focus  we realigned our segment methodology during the first quarter of  and identified these three business divisions as meeting the criteria of an operating segment 
during the fourth quarter of  a fourth operating segment  the united commercial bank segment the ucb segment was identified as a result of the ucb acquisition 
the ucb segment is currently identified as a segment due to the significant size of the transaction and meets the other requirements of a segment  that is  the segment engages in business activities from which it earns 
table of contents revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance and for which discrete financial information is available 
management will continue to evaluate the ucb segment going forward and make any required realignment as it fully integrates with the company s other business operations 
the retail banking segment focuses primarily on retail operations through the bank s branch network 
the commercial banking segment  which includes commercial real estate  primarily generates commercial loans through the efforts of the commercial lending offices located in the bank s northern and southern california production offices 
furthermore  the commercial banking segment also offers a wide variety of international finance and trade services and products 
the former residential lending segment has been combined with the retail banking segment due to the consumer centric nature of the products and services offered by these two segments as well as the synergistic relationship between these two units in generating consumer mortgage loans 
the ucb segment focuses primarily on the contribution towards the company s overall business operations resulting from the acquired loan and deposit portfolio of united commercial bank 
the remaining centralized functions  including the former treasury segment  and eliminations of intersegment amounts have been aggregated and included in other 
changes in our management structure or reporting methodologies may result in changes in the measurement of operating segment results 
results for prior periods are generally restated for comparability for changes in management structure or reporting methodologies unless it is not deemed practicable to do so 
given the significant decline in short term and long term interest rates since  we reassessed our transfer pricing assumptions during the first quarter of to be consistent with the company s strategic goal of growing core deposits and originating profitable  good credit quality loans 
changes to our funds transfer pricing assumptions were made with the intent to promote core deposit growth and  given our recent credit experience  to better reflect the current risk profiles of various loan categories within our credit portfolio 
our transfer pricing assumptions and methodologies are reviewed at least annually to ensure that our process is reflective of current market conditions 
our transfer pricing process is formulated with the goal of incenting loan and deposit growth that is consistent with the company s overall growth objectives as well as provide a reasonable and consistent basis for measurement of our business segments and product net interest margins 
changes to our transfer pricing assumptions and methodologies are approved by the asset liability committee 
the changes in transfer pricing assumptions that we implemented during the first quarter of have not been reflected in the segment results for since these changes were adopted on a prospective basis 
we have  however  performed a high level assessment of the impact of these transfer pricing assumption changes to the various operating segments 
based on this assessment  we determined that the full year impact of these changes was not significant overall  and would have been favorable to the segment pre tax profit loss results for the retail banking and commercial banking segments but unfavorable to the other segment during additionally  the changes in transfer pricing assumptions implemented during the first quarter of would not have altered the conclusion of our goodwill impairment test performed as of december   had these assumptions been retroactively implemented during for more information about our segments  including information about the underlying accounting and reporting process  please see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report

net interest income for this segment increased to million during  compared to million for the increase in net interest income during the is attributable to the interest rate floors on newly originated variable rate loans  which partially offsets the steep decline in interest rates 
the sizeable increase in loan loss provisions for this segment during  relative to  was due to increased charge off activity resulting from the continued downturn in the real estate housing market 
loan loss provisions are also impacted by average loan balances for each reporting segment 
noninterest income for this segment decreased  to million for  from million in the decrease in noninterest income is primarily due to lower loan fee income resulting from a decrease in our loan origination activities and lower net gain on sale of loans  partially offset by an increase in branch related revenues

the increases in total assets were funded primarily through increases in deposit growth of billion and fhlb advances of million 
total asset and liability growth was predominantly the result of the november  acquisition of united commercial bank 
securities purchased under resale agreements we purchase securities under resale agreements resale agreements with terms that range from one day to several years 
total resale agreements increased to million as of december   compared with million at december  the increase as of december  reflects an additional resale agreement for million entered into during and the assumption of million in resale agreements  less a discount of million  resulting from the ucb acquisition 
purchases of securities under resale agreements are overcollateralized to ensure against unfavorable market price movements 
we monitor the market value of the underlying securities which collateralize the related receivable on resale agreements  including accrued interest 
in the event that the fair market value of the securities decreases below the carrying amount of the related repurchase agreement  our counterparty is required to designate an equivalent value of additional securities 
the counterparties to these agreements are nationally recognized investment banking firms that meet credit eligibility criteria and with whom a master repurchase agreement has been duly executed 
investment securities income from investing activities provides a significant portion of our total income 
we aim to maintain an investment portfolio with an adequate mix of fixed rate and adjustable rate securities with relatively short maturities to minimize overall interest rate risk 
our investment securities portfolio primarily consists of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  us government sponsored enterprise debt securities  us government sponsored and other mortgage backed securities  municipal securities  corporate debt securities  residual securities  and us government sponsored enterprise equity securities 
we classify certain investment securities as held to maturity  and accordingly  these securities are recorded based on their amortized cost 
we also classify certain investments as available for sale  and accordingly  these securities are carried at their estimated fair values with the corresponding changes in fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  as a component of stockholders equity 
we had no held to maturity investment securities as of december  compared to million at december  during and subsequent to the ucb acquisition  we transferred million held to maturity investment securities to available for sale 
total investment securities available for sale increased to billion as of december   compared with billion at december  the increase in investment securities was 
table of contents funded by deposit growth  capital raised during  and the government assisted acquisition of united commercial bank

at december   investment securities available for sale with a par value of billion were pledged to secure public deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  frb discount window  and for other purposes required or permitted by law 
we perform regular impairment analyses on the investment securities 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  an impairment writedown is recognized in current earnings 
other than temporary declines in fair value are assessed based on factors including the duration the security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position  the severity of the decline in value  the rating of the security  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and our ability and intent on holding the securities until the fair values recover 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or prices obtained from independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
the company performs a monthly analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and ongoing review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
the company ensures whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if the company determines there is a more appropriate fair value based upon available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 
as a result of the global financial crisis and illiquidity in the us markets  we believe the current broker prices that we have obtained on our private label mortgage backed securities and trust preferred debt and equity securities are based on forced liquidation or distressed sale values in very inactive markets that are not representative of the economic value of these securities 
the fair values of private label mortgage backed securities and trust preferred securities have traditionally been based on the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers since broker quotes in an active market are given the highest priority under asc however  in light of these circumstances  we have modified our approach in determining the fair values of these securities 
we have determined that each of these securities will be individually examined for the appropriate valuation methodology based on a combination of the market approach reflecting current broker prices and the income approach based on discounted cash flows 
in calculating the fair value derived from the income approach  the company made assumptions related to the implied rate of return  general change in market rates  estimated changes in credit quality and liquidity risk premium  specific non performance and default experience in the collateral underlying the security  as well as broker discount rates are taken into consideration in determining the discount rate 
the values resulting from each approach ie market and income approaches are weighted to derive the final fair value on each private label mortgage backed and trust preferred security 

table of contents the majority of unrealized losses in the available for sale portfolio at december  are related to trust preferred debt securities 
as of december   the company had million in trust preferred debt securities available for sale  representing less than of the total investment securities available for sale portfolio 
during the year  except for one security that maintained its rating and one security which was downgraded but remained at investment grade status  the ratings for the other fourteen trust preferred securities were downgraded to non investment grade status due to increased deferral and default activity from the issuers of the underlying debt collateralizing these instruments 
as of december   these debt instruments had gross unrealized losses amounting to million  or of the total amortized cost basis of these securities  comprised of million in gross unrealized losses and million  or million on a net of tax basis  in noncredit related impairment losses recorded during the year ended december  pursuant to the provisions of asc as a result of the previously discussed diminishing collateral values  deteriorating cash flows  and increasing estimates of future deferrals and defaults  we recorded an impairment loss of million on our portfolio of trust preferred securities during the year of which million was a pre tax credit loss recorded through earnings 
included in the million in gross unrealized losses  is the reclassification of million  or million on a net of tax basis  in previously recognized noncredit related impairment losses from the opening balance of retained earnings to other comprehensive income 
this reclassification was recorded as of march  pursuant to the provisions of fsp fas and fas in addition  million of non investment grade mortgage backed securities  representing of the total investment securities have an unrealized loss of million or of the aggregate amortized cost basis of these securities as of december  we have seven individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or longer as of december  these securities are comprised of six trust preferred securities with a total fair value of million and one mortgage backed security with a total fair value of million 
as of december   there were also seventy one securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
the unrealized losses on these securities are primarily attributed to changes in interest rates as well as the liquidity crisis that has impacted all financial industries 
the issuers of these securities have not  to our knowledge  established any cause for default on these securities 
these securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market interest rates have fluctuated 
however  we have the ability and the intention to hold these securities until their fair values recover to cost or maturity 
as such  management does not deem these securities to be other than temporarily impaired 
in september  the liquidity and credit concerns led the us federal government to assume a conservatorship role in fannie mae and freddie mac 
the rating on fannie mae and freddie mac preferred securities was downgraded from bbb to c reflecting the cessation of dividend payments on these securities 
these securities are non cumulative perpetual preferred stock in which unpaid dividends do not accumulate 
the purchase agreement between the us treasury and these government sponsored entities contains a covenant prohibiting the payment of dividends on existing preferred stock 
as the assessment on the status of any resumption in dividend payments on these securities was uncertain  in accordance with asc  we recorded million in otti charges on fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock securities in in december  we recorded an additional million in otti charges

the difference between the undiscounted contractual cash flows and the undiscounted expected cash flows is the nonaccretable difference 
the nonaccretable difference represents our estimate of the credit losses expected and was written off as of the acquisition date 
in the determination of contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected  we assumed no prepayment on the sop nonaccrual loan pools as we do not anticipate any significant prepayments on credit impaired loans 
for the sop accrual loans for single family  multi family and commercial real estate  we used a third party vendor to obtain the prepayment speed 
the third party vendor is recognized in the mortgage industry for the delivery of prepayment and default models for the secondary market to identify loan level prepayment  delinquency  default  and loss propensities 
the prepayment rates for the construction  land  commercial and consumer pools have historically been low and so we applied the prepayment assumptions of our current portfolio using our internal modeling 
the company has elected to account for all loans acquired in the fdic assisted acquisition of united commercial bank under asc as the accounting treatment subsequent to acquisition date fair value 
united commercial bank s loan portfolio included unfunded commitments for commercial lines of credit  constructions draws and other lending activity 
any additional advances on these loans subsequent to november  are not accounted for under asc the total commitment outstanding as of the acquisition date is included under the shared loss agreement 
as such  any additional advances  up to the total commitment outstanding at the time of acquisition are covered loans 
the covered loans acquired are and will continue to be subject to the bank s internal and external credit review and monitoring 
if credit deterioration is experienced subsequent to the november  acquisition fair value amount  such deterioration will be measured through our loss reserving methodology and a provision for credit losses will be charged to earnings with a partially offsetting noninterest income item reflecting the increase to the fdic indemnification asset or receivable

the payoff activity during this period of time was higher than anticipated and what was modeled  however management does not believe this activity suggests the need for a change in the original prepayment assumptions at this time 
the loan discount related to these prepayments of million was recorded as a yield adjustment to interest income 
no impairment write downs were recorded in fdic indemnification asset as of november   we recorded an fdic indemnification asset of billion  consisting of the present value of the amounts the company expects to receive from the fdic under the shared loss agreement 
the difference between the present value and the undiscounted cash flow the company expects to collect from the fdic is accreted into noninterest income over the life of the fdic indemnification asset 
from the period of time from november  through december   the company recorded million of accretion into income 
additionally  because of the high prepayment activity during this timeframe  the company reduced the fdic indemnification asset by million and recorded the adjustment as noninterest income

we offer mortgage loans secured by one to four unit residential properties located in our primary lending areas 
at december   million or of the loan portfolio was secured by one to four family residential real estate properties  compared to million or at december  residential single family loan balances increased year over year due to the desecuritization of our private label mortgage backed securities in the second quarter of and new originations 
the desecuritizations in the second quarter of resulted in a million increase in single family loans receivable with a corresponding decrease to available for sale securities 
residential single family loan origination activity increased in  with million in new loan originations during  compared with million in this increase in the loan origination was primarily due to market improvements 
further  we sold approximately million in conforming and non conforming residential single family loans through our secondary marketing efforts during  compared to million sold in we offer both fixed and adjustable rate arm single family residential mortgage loan programs 
we primarily offer arm loan programs that have six month  three year  five year  or seven year initial fixed periods 
we originate single family residential mortgage loans under three different types of programs full alternative documentation  reduced documentation and no documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels 
our underwriting criteria for all the loans in our single family residential mortgage loan programs include minimum fair isaac corporation fico credit scores and maximum loan to value ltv ratios 
additionally  our full alternative documentation loan program requires verification of employment and income 
reduced documentation loans are primarily intended for borrowers who are self employed 
generally  we require reduced documentation borrowers to have more equity in the property and higher amounts of liquid reserves 
finally  our no documentation loan program is designed for borrowers who demonstrate excellent credit quality and have the ability to 
table of contents place a large down payment or have high equity in the property 
we still do reduced and no documentation loans  but the risk is minimal due to our stringent underwriting criteria 
of the million in residential single family mortgage loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation loans  or million were reduced documentation loans  or million were no documentation loans  and or million were limited document loans 
in comparison  of the million in residential single family mortgage loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation loans  or million were reduced documentation loans and or million were no documentation loans 
based on management s evaluation and analysis of the portfolio credit quality and prevailing economic conditions  we believe the loan loss provision is adequate for losses inherent in the portfolio as of december  multifamily real estate loans 
at december   billion or of the loan portfolio was secured by multifamily real estate properties  compared to million or at december  multifamily loan balances increased year over year primarily due to the desecuritization of our private label mortgage backed securities in the second quarter of the desecuritizations in the second quarter of resulted in a million increase in multifamily loans receivable with a corresponding decrease to available for sale securities 
we originated million multifamily loans in  as compared to million in although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
multifamily real estate loans accounted for billion or  and million or  of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
additionally  we own single family and multifamily residential mortgage loans that have contractual features that may increase our credit exposure 
these mortgage loans include adjustable rate mortgage loans that may subject borrowers to significant future payment increases or create the potential for negative amortization of the principal balance 
interest only mortgage loans allow interest only payments for a fixed period of time 
at the end of the interest only period  the loan payment includes principal payments and increases significantly 
the borrower s new payment once the loan becomes amortizing ie  includes principal payments will be greater than if the borrower had been making principal payments since the origination of the loan 
the longer the interest only period  the larger the amortizing payment will be when the interest only period ends 
there were million and million in interest only loans held in the bank s portfolio as of december  and  respectively 
historically  losses experienced from interest only loans have been minimal and we do not believe potential losses from these loans will be significant 
the bank has purchased adjustable rate mortgage loans which permit different repayment options 
the monthly payment for adjustable rate mortgage loans with negative amortization features is set as the initial interest rate for the first year of the loan 
after that point  the borrower can make a minimum payment that is limited to a increase in payment 
if the minimum payment is not adequate to cover the interest amount due on the mortgage loan  the loan would have negative amortization  which will result in an increase in the mortgage loans principal balance 
these loans completely re amortize every five years and the monthly payment is reset at that point 
none of the adjustable rate mortgages held in the bank s loan portfolio that have the potential to negatively amortize were negatively amortizing as of december  and we do not believe potential losses from these loans will be significant 

table of contents our total exposure related to these products in our loan portfolio for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows table nontraditional mortgage products unpaid principal balance as of december  in thousands interest only mortgage loans adjustable rate mortgages with negative amortization features residential single family loans residential multifamily loans all of the loans we originate are subject to our underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards 
generally  loans obtained from third party originators  including the higher risk loans in the preceding table  are closed and funded in our name and are also subject to our same underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards 
we believe our strict underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks which may come from these products 
we conduct a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits to ensure compliance with our origination standards  including our criteria for lending and legal requirements 
commercial real estate loans 
we continue to place emphasis in the origination of commercial real estate loans 
although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
commercial real estate loans accounted for billion or  and billion or  of our non covered loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
since substantially all of our real estate loans are secured by properties located in california  declines in the california economy and in real estate values could have a significant effect on the collectibility of our loans and on the level of allowance for loan losses required

mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value 
the fair value of servicing assets is determined based on the present value of estimated net future cash flows related to contractually specified servicing fees 
the primary determinants of the fair value of mortgage servicing assets are prepayment speeds and discount rates 
published industry standards are used to derive market based assumptions 
changes in the assumptions used may have a significant impact on the valuation of mortgage servicing assets 
evaluation of impairment is performed on a quarterly basis 
we record mortgage servicing assets for loans sold or securitized for which servicing has been retained by the bank 
we recorded an impairment of million in mortgage servicing assets during  compared with million in impairment writedown in the decline in interest rates as well as the overall increases in borrower refinancing and prepayment rates related to the underlying sold or securitized loans have caused the value of mortgage servicing assets to decrease

table of contents non covered nonperforming assets loans are continually monitored by management and the board of directors 
generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if either i principal or interest payments are past due in excess of days  or ii the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain  regardless of the length of past due status 
when a loan reaches nonaccrual status  any interest accrued on the loan is reversed and charged against current income 
in general  subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans that demonstrate a satisfactory payment trend for several months are returned to full accrual status subject to management s assessment of the full collectibility of the account

we evaluate loan impairment according to the provisions of asc previously sfas no 

under asc  loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation will be established 
also  in accordance with asc  loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the quarterly migration analysis when determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses required for the period 
at december   the company s total recorded investment in impaired loans was million  compared with million at december  the decrease in impaired loans is largely due to a decrease in nonperforming residential construction loans 
all nonaccrual and doubtful loans are included in impaired loans

in light of the credit and mortgage crisis affecting the entire financial industry and its impact on our borrowers  the company has taken a more proactive approach to assess potential loan impairment in our overall portfolio 
we have expanded our scope to perform focused reviews of certain sectors of our loan portfolio to identify and mitigate potential losses 
our recent experience made us aware of the rapid deterioration occurring in the market in a relatively short period of time 
specifically  we have noted that while our borrowers may continue to pay as agreed in accordance with their contractual terms and or even though loans may not have reached a significant stage of delinquency  the existence of certain warning signs indicating possible collectibility issues warranted a more careful scrutiny of these loans for potential impairment 
specifically  we reviewed loans that exhibited the following characteristics diminishing or adverse changes in cash flows that serve as the principal source of repayment  adverse changes in the financial position or net worth of guarantors or investors  adverse changes in collateral values for collateral dependent loans  declining or adverse changes in inventory levels securing commercial business and trade finance  failure in meeting financial covenants  or other changes or conditions that may adversely impact the ultimate collectibility of loans 
although certain loans are not days or more delinquent and therefore still accruing interest  we have classified them as impaired as of december  because they exhibit one or more of the characteristics described above 
allowance for loan losses we are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
in addition to regular  quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   future additions to the allowance will be subject to a continuing evaluation of estimated and known  as well as inherent  risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period operating results  and is increased or decreased by the amount of net recoveries or chargeoffs  respectively  during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  compared with million  or of total loans  at december  the million increase in the allowance for loan losses at december   from year end  reflects million in additional loss provisions  less million in net chargeoffs during the year 
the allowance for unfunded loan commitments  off balance sheet credit exposures  and recourse provisions is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in the off balance sheet allowance amount was primarily due to the increase in loss percentage allocated for loans sold securitized with recourse and unfunded commitments at december  relative to year end we recorded million in loan loss provisions during  as compared to million in loss provisions recorded during the increase in loss provisions recorded during  compared to  was brought on by the sustained downturn in the real estate market and continued instability

during  we recorded million in net chargeoffs representing of average non covered loans outstanding during the year 
in comparison  we recorded net chargeoffs totaling million  or of average loans outstanding  during also during the year we had note sale proceeds of million on notes with a carrying value of million 
the difference between the carrying value and the sale amount was charged against the allowance for loan losses 
given the trends we are seeing in the loan portfolio  it is expected that provision for loan losses and net charge offs will continue to decrease throughout the following table summarizes activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated table allowance for loan losses at or for the year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance balance  beginning of year allowance from acquisitions allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit provision for loan losses impact of desecuritization gross chargeoffs residential single family multifamily real estate commercial and industrial real estate construction commercial business trade finance automobile other consumer total gross chargeoffs gross recoveries residential single family residential multifamily commercial and industrial real estate construction commercial business trade finance automobile other consumer total gross recoveries net chargeoffs recoveries allowance balance  end of year average loans outstanding total gross loans outstanding  end of year net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans allowance for loan losses to total gross loans at end of year our methodology to determine the overall appropriateness of the allowance is based on a classification migration model and qualitative considerations 
the technique of migration analysis essentially looks at pools of loans having similar characteristics and analyzes their loss rates over a historical period 
in determining the loss rates  we review our historical loss rates for the past twelve 
table of contents quarters 
this loss horizon was shortened during to better reflect the current environment and the bank s current loan portfolio and loss trends 
we utilize historical loss factors derived from trends and losses associated with each pool over a specified period of time 
based on this process  we assign loss factors to each loan grade within each category of loans 
loss rates derived by the migration model are based predominantly on historical loss trends that may not be indicative of the actual or inherent loss potential for loan categories 
as such  we utilize qualitative and environmental factors as adjusting mechanisms to supplement the historical results of the classification migration model 
qualitative considerations include  but are not limited to  prevailing economic or market conditions  relative risk profiles of various loan segments  the strength or deficiency of the internal control environment  volume concentrations  growth trends  delinquency and nonaccrual status  problem loan trends  and geographic concentrations 
qualitative and environmental factors are reflected as percent adjustments and are added to the historical loss rates derived from the classified asset migration model to determine the appropriate allowance amount for each loan category 
in consideration of the significant growth and increasing diversity and credit risk profiles of loans in our portfolio over the past several years  our classification migration model utilizes eighteen risk rated or heterogeneous loan pool categories and three homogeneous loan categories 
the loan sectors included in the heterogeneous loan pools are residential single family  residential multifamily  commercial real estate  construction  commercial business  trade finance  and automobile loans 
with the exception of automobile loans  all other heterogeneous loan categories have been broken down into additional subcategories 
for example  the commercial real estate loan category is further segmented into six subcategories based on industry sector 
these subcategories include retail  office  industrial  land  hotel motel  and other special purpose or miscellaneous 
by sectionalizing these broad loan categories into smaller subgroups  we are better able to isolate and identify the risks associated with each subgroup based on historical loss trends 
in addition to the eighteen heterogeneous loan categories  our classification migration model also utilizes three homogeneous loan categories which encompass predominantly consumer related credits 
specifically  these homogeneous loan categories are home equity lines  overdraft protection lines  and credit card loans 
the following table reflects the company s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated 
table allowance for loan losses by loan category at december  amount amount dollars in thousands residential single family residential multifamily commercial and industrial real estate construction commercial business trade finance automobile consumer and other total 
table of contents the increase of million in the allowance for loan at december   relative to year end  was primarily due to increased loss estimates and historic losses for individual loan categories 
except for trade finance loans  loss reserves on all loan categories increased  reflecting the downturn in the residential real estate market and deteriorating conditions in the overall economy 
loss reserves for construction and land loans included in commercial and industrial real estate increased significantly from december   reflecting the sharp decline in values experienced in these portfolios 
the decrease in loss reserves on trade finance loans is in line with the contraction of this portfolio since year end deposits we offer a wide variety of deposit account products to both consumer and commercial customers 
total deposits increased billion to billion at december   as compared to billion at december  the increase in deposits was primarily due to the acquisition of billion in deposits  at fair value  from the ucb acquisition

risk based capital we are committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure our shareholders  our customers and our regulators that our company and our bank subsidiary are financially sound 
we are subject to risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators in january these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
according to the regulations  institutions whose tier i and

at december   the bank s tier i and total capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  the following table compares east west bancorp  inc s and east west bank s actual capital ratios at december   to those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well capitalized classification purposes table regulatory required ratios east west bancorp east west bank minimum regulatory requirements well capitalized requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets asset liability and market risk management liquidity liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the bank  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco  and issuances of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
in addition  government programs  such as the fdic s tlgp  may influence deposit behavior 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash inflows from operating activities were primarily due to net income earned during the year 
net cash inflows outflows from investing activities totaled billion  million  and million during   and  respectively 
net cash inflows from investing activities for were due primarily to repayment and redemption of investment securities 
net cash outflows from investing activities for were due primarily to purchases of investment securities 
these factors were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of investment securities and loans  as well as repayments  maturities and redemptions of investment securities 
for  net cash outflows from investing activities can be attributed primarily to the growth in our loan portfolio and purchases of available for sale securities 
these activities were partially offset by repayments  maturities  redemptions and net sales proceeds from investment securities 

table of contents we experienced net cash outflows from financing activities of billion during the year ended december   primarily due to repayment of short term borrowings 
during  we had net cash inflows from financing activities of million primarily due to million net proceeds received from the issuance of series a and series b preferred stock during april and december  respectively  as well as the net increase in deposits 
as a result of the turbulence in the banking sector  we experienced a notable growth in deposit products that afford greater deposit insurance coverage to deposit customers during the second half of as of december   time deposits within the cdars program increased to million  compared to million at december  the cdars program allows customers with deposits in excess of fdic insured limits to obtain full coverage on time deposits through a network of banks within the cdars program 
additionally  during the third quarter of  we partnered with another financial institution to implement a new retail sweep product for non time deposit accounts to provide added deposit insurance coverage for deposits in excess of fdic insured limits 
cash from financing activities were partially offset by net decreases in federal funds purchased and fhlb advances  as well as million of existing cash and cash equivalents to pay cash dividends to our stockholders 
during  proceeds from federal funds purchased  fhlb advances  and long term debt accounted for net cash inflows from financing activities totaling million 
these factors were partially offset by a net decrease in deposits  purchases of treasury shares related to our board approved share repurchase program  and dividends paid on common stock 
as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have available a combination of borrowing sources comprised of the federal reserve bank s discount window  fhlb advances  federal funds lines with various correspondent banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
during  we obtained additional borrowing capacity from the federal reserve discount window of almost million by pledging construction and commercial business loans 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our day to day cash flow requirements 
at december   we are not aware of any trends  events or uncertainties that had or were reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
as of december   we are not aware of any material commitments for capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
the liquidity of east west bancorp  inc is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  east west bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
the bank is permitted to pay dividend to the company as long as the banking regulatory authorities of the bank are notified of the proposed dividend and there is non objection language from the banking regulatory authorities 
for the years ended december  and  total dividends paid by the bank to east west bancorp  inc amounted to million and million  respectively 
as of december   approximately million of undivided profits of the bank were available for dividends to the company 
on january   the board of directors declared first quarter dividends on the company s common stock and series a preferred stock 
the board of directors authorized common stock dividends of per share for the first quarter of interest rate sensitivity management our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk  which is the impact of adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value 
although in the normal course of business we manage other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  we consider interest rate risk to be among the more significant market risks and could potentially have material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the fundamental objective of the asset liability management process is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
our strategy is formulated by the asset liability committee  which coordinates with the board of directors to monitor our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee meets regularly to evaluate  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio including those attributable to hedging transactions  if any  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
our overall strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of immediate incremental changes in market interest rates rate shock on net interest income and net portfolio value 
net portfolio value is defined as the present value of assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the attainment of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
to minimize the adverse impact of changes in market interest rates  we simulate the effect of instantaneous interest rate changes on net interest income and net portfolio value on a quarterly basis 
the table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of equity as of december  and  assuming a non parallel shift of and basis points in both directions table rate shock table net interest income volatility net portfolio value volatility change in interest rates basis points december  december  december  december  the percentage change represents net interest income for twelve months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  and at december  and  our estimated changes in net interest income and net portfolio value were within the ranges established by the board of directors 
our primary analytical tool to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators  and is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to predict changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model and other available public sources are incorporated into the model 
adjustments are made to reflect the shift in the treasury and other appropriate yield curves 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels by product line and takes into account our increased ability to control rates offered on deposit products in comparison to our ability to control rates on adjustable rate loans tied to the published indices 

table of contents the following table provides the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates of our financial instruments as of december  the information presented below is based on the repricing date for variable rate instruments and the expected maturity date for fixed rate instruments 
table expected maturity for financial instruments expected maturity or repricing date by year after total fair value at december  dollars in thousands assets cd investments average yield fixed rate short term investments weighted average rate securities purchased under resale agreements weighted average rate investment securities available for sale fixed rate weighted average rate investment securities available for sale variable rate weighted average rate total gross loans weighted average rate liabilities checking accounts weighted average rate money market accounts weighted average rate savings deposits weighted average rate time deposits weighted average rate short term borrowings weighted average rate fhlb advances term weighted average rate short term repurchase agreements weighted average rate securities sold under repurchase agreements fixed rate weighted average rate securities sold under repurchase agreements variable rate weighted average rate subordinated debt weighted average rate junior subordinated debt fixed rate weighted average rate junior subordinated debt variable rate weighted average rate other borrowing variable rate weighted average rate includes hybrid securities that have fixed interest rates for the first three or five years 
thereafter  interest rates become adjustable based on a predetermined index 
total rate sensitive loans  total nonrate sensitive loans non performing loans  weighted average rate expected maturities of assets are contractual maturities adjusted for projected payment based on contractual amortization and unscheduled prepayments of principal as well as repricing frequency 
expected maturities for deposits are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected rollover rates for deposits with no stated maturity dates 
we utilize assumptions supported by documented analyses for the expected maturities of our loans and repricing of our deposits 
we also use prepayment projections for amortizing securities 
the actual maturities of these instruments could vary significantly if future prepayments and repricing frequencies differ from our expectations based on historical experience 
the fair values of short term investments approximate their book values due to their short maturities 
for securities purchased under resale agreements  fair values are calculated by discounting 
table of contents future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates utilizing estimated market discount rates 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or prices obtained from independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has reviewed the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
for private label mortgage backed securities and pooled trust preferred securities  fair values are derived based on a combination of broker prices and discounted cash flow analyses that are weighted as deemed appropriate for each security 
the fair value of loans is determined based on the discounted cash flow approach 
the discount rate is derived from the associated yield curve plus spreads  and reflects the offering rates in the market for loans with similar financial characteristics 
the fair value of deposits is determined based on the discounted cash flow approach 
the discount rate is derived from the associated yield curve  plus spread  if any 
for core deposits  the cash outflows are projected by the decay rate based on the bank s core deposit premium study 
cash flows for all non time deposits are discounted using the libor yield curve 
for time deposits  the cash flows are based on the contractual runoff and are discounted by the bank s current offering rates  plus spread 
for federal funds purchased  fair value approximates book value due to their short maturities 
the fair value of fhlb term advances is estimated by discounting the cash flows through maturity or the next repricing date based on current rates offered by the fhlb for borrowings with similar maturities 
customer repurchase agreements  which have maturities ranging from one to three days  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interests rates paid on these instruments are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair values of securities sold under repurchase agreements are calculated by discounting future cash flows based on expected maturities or repricing dates  utilizing estimated market discount rates and taking into consideration the call features of each instrument 
for both subordinated and junior subordinated debt instruments  fair values are estimated by discounting cash flows through maturity based on current market rates the bank would pay for new issuances 
the asset liability committee is authorized to utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist in the management of interest rate risk 
we may elect to use derivative financial instruments as part of our asset and liability management strategy  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin and stockholders equity 
currently  derivative instruments do not have material effect on our operating results or financial position
