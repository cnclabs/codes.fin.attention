item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is provided as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition  the changes in our financial condition and our results of operations 
our discussion is organized as follows critical accounting policies 
this section contains a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are important to our financial condition and results of operations and that require judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application 
in addition  all of our significant accounting policies  including critical accounting policies  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
results of operations 
this section contains an analysis of our results of operations by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december   and comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding debt and commitments at december  critical accounting policies general our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial 
table of contents statements requires our management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable in light of current circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ materially from these estimates 
valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at their estimated fair values 
the estimates used to determine the fair value of long lived assets  such as intangible assets  can be complex and require significant judgments 
we use information available to us to make fair value determinations and engage independent valuation specialists  when necessary  to assist in the fair value determination of significant acquired long lived assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of intangible assets to determine the amount of acquisition related intangible asset amortization expense to record in future periods 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives assigned to our intangible assets to determine whether such estimated useful lives continue to be appropriate 
we review the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
accounting guidance requires us to perform a two step impairment test on goodwill 
first  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and we compare the aggregate fair values to our market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of our fair value measurements 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the unit s net assets  goodwill is not impaired and further testing is not required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the fair value of the unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and any impairment charge 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves judgment and the use of significant estimates and assumptions  which include assumptions regarding the revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate estimated future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates and future economic and market conditions 
our most recent impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
we review acquired intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
measurement of any impairment loss is based on estimated fair value 
based on our impairment assessments in  we determined that our acquired intangible assets were not impaired 
given the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset balances  an adverse change in fair value could result in an impairment charge  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenues are generated from monthly account and transaction based fees 
deferred revenues consist primarily of advance billings for services 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
revenues are primarily recognized under service agreements that are long term in nature  generally three to five years  and that do not require management to make significant judgments or assumptions 
given the nature of our business and the rules governing revenue recognition  our revenue recognition practices do not involve significant estimates that materially affect our results of operations 
additional information about our revenue recognition policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet variable interest entities or other off balance sheet financing  other than operating leases 
we use derivative financial instruments for managing

liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are i to fund normal operating expenses  ii to meet the principal and interest requirements of our outstanding indebtedness  and iii to fund capital expenditures and operating lease payments

indebtedness december  in millions long term debt including current maturities in  we used a portion of our operating cash flow to repay million of debt  which reduced our total outstanding debt  including current maturities  to billion at december  our long term debt currently consists primarily of billion under our unsecured senior term loan facility and billion under senior notes borrowings 
we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants in senior term loan in december  we entered into an unsecured senior term loan facility with a syndicate of banks 
our term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate and mature in november principal payments of million and million are due in december and  respectively  and the remaining principal of billion is due in november the weighted average variable interest rate on the term loan borrowings was at december  the term loan facility contains various restrictions and covenants substantially similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility described below 
revolving credit facility we maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate based on libor plus a specified margin or the bank s base rate 
there are no significant commitment fees or compensating balance requirements 
the revolving credit facility  as amended  contains various restrictions and covenants that require us  among other things  to limit our consolidated indebtedness to no more than three and one half times consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments  and to maintain consolidated net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and certain other adjustments of at least three times consolidated interest expense 
the facility expires on march  as of december   we issued letters of credit totaling million under this facility and our available borrowings were million 

table of contents senior notes in november  we issued billion of senior notes due in november and million of senior notes due in november  which pay interest at the stated rate on may and november of each year 
the interest rates applicable to these notes are subject to an increase of up to two percent in the event that our credit rating is downgraded below investment grade 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other matters  limit our ability to consolidate or merge into  or convey  transfer or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets to  another person  our ability to create or assume liens  and our ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions 
interest rate hedge contracts to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  we maintain a series of interest rate swap agreements swaps with total notional values of billion at december  the swaps effectively fix interest rates on floating rate term loan borrowings at a weighted average rate of approximately  prior to financing spreads and related fees  and have expiration dates through september shelf registration statement in  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  we may sell common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  or a combination thereof 
each time we sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we will provide a prospectus supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the securities being offered and of the offering 
we may offer and sell the securities pursuant to this prospectus from time to time in one or more of the following ways through underwriters or dealers  through agents  directly to purchasers or through a combination of any of these methods of sales 
proceeds from the sale of these securities may be used to repay debt or for working capital  acquisitions or general corporate purposes 
other access to capital markets impacts our cost of capital  our ability to refinance maturing debt and our ability to fund future acquisitions 
our ability to access capital on favorable terms depends on a number of factors  including general market conditions  interest rates  credit ratings on our debt securities  perception of our potential future earnings and the market price of our common stock 
as of december   we had a credit rating of baa with a stable outlook from moody s investors service  inc moody s and bbb with a negative outlook from standard poor s ratings services s p on our senior unsecured debt securities 
the interest rate payable on our senior notes is subject to adjustment from time to time if moody s or s p downgrades or subsequently upgrades the debt rating applicable to the notes 
if the ratings from moody s or s p decrease below investment grade  the per annum interest rate on the notes is subject to increase by up to 
in no event will the per annum interest rate be reduced below the original interest rate applicable to the senior notes or will the total increase in the per annum interest rate exceed above the original interest rate 
the interest rates on any series of notes will permanently cease to be subject to any adjustment if the notes becomes rated a or its equivalent or higher by moody s and a or its equivalent or higher by s p  in each case with a stable or positive outlook 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  interest rates  currency exchange rates  indices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a certain financial instrument or group of financial instruments 
we are exposed primarily to interest rate risk and market price risk on outstanding debt  investments of subscriber funds and foreign currency risk 
we actively monitor these risks through a variety of control procedures involving senior management 
in connection with processing electronic payments transactions  the funds we receive from subscribers are invested from the time we collect the funds until payments are made to the applicable merchants 
these subscriber funds are generally invested in short term instruments that are guaranteed by the united states government 
subscriber funds  which are not included in our consolidated balance sheets  can fluctuate significantly based on consumer bill payment activity  and totaled approximately billion as of december  based on interest rates and subscriber funds balances at december   a increase in applicable interest rates would increase our annual income from continuing operations by approximately million  and if applicable interest rates decreased to zero  our annual income from continuing operations would decrease by less than million 
we manage our debt structure and interest rate risk through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and through the use of interest rate hedge contracts 
we currently use interest rate swaps  with total notional values of billion at december   to partially hedge our exposure to interest rate changes and to control financing costs 
generally  under these swaps  we agree with a counter party to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional amount 
based on our outstanding debt with variable interest rates as of december   a increase in our borrowing rate would increase annual interest expense in by less than million 
we conduct business in the us and in foreign countries and are exposed to foreign currency risk from changes in the value of underlying assets and liabilities of our non us dollar denominated foreign investments and foreign currency transactions 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of in foreign currency rates against the us dollar 
if these rates were higher or lower at december   there would not have been a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position
