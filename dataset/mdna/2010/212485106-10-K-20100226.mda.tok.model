at t  our largest client  has substantially migrated its subscribers from the legacy wireless billing system that we supported through a managed services agreement onto at t s other wireless billing system 
in addition  at t acquired several other convergys clients that also migrated to this other billing system 
the loss of revenue resulting from the at t related migrations was approximately in compared to our information management revenues 
this migration was substantially completed by december  we expect revenue loss resulting from the at t related migrations to be approximately in compared to our information management revenues 
in september  sprint pcs  a large data processing outsourcing client  completed its acquisition of nextel communications 
in  sprint nextel informed us that it intended to consolidate its billing systems onto a competitor s system 
the migration began in and was fully completed by december  revenues from sprint nextel were down approximately in compared to the prior year 
we expect revenue from sprint nextel to be down by approximately in compared to our information management revenues 
the impact of these client migrations is included in our guidance detailed in the business outlook section 
hr management our hr management segment provides a full range of hr outsourcing solutions including benefits administration  compensation  hr administration  learning  payroll administration  performance management  recruiting and sourcing services to large companies and governmental entities

in addition to the of implementation revenue described above  operating results include implementation related  settlement and impairment charges of and in and  respectively 
these charges were primarily driven by two large hr management contracts 
the company restructured both of those large hr management contracts during to eliminate future implementation obligations related to services not operational to continue providing services already operational 
as a result  all of the capitalized implementation costs related to these contracts were written off and a portion of implementation revenue  as referenced above  was recognized 
completing the contract restructurings has stabilized the hr management business and has eliminated the future implementation risk on services not yet operational 
we have undertaken a series of actions intended to improve the future earnings in hr management 
actions include not signing any new hr management outsourcing business with significant implementation risk  streamlining existing operations by continuing to use additional automation  standardization and leveraging of off shore labor  and using partners to implement projects

the foreign exchange transaction gains and losses arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
as discussed in further detail in the section titled market risk  we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts to protect the company against these foreign currency exposures 
the gains and losses from these forward exchange contracts are reported within the other income expense  net caption in the consolidated results of operations 
our effective tax benefit rate was for compared to an effective tax benefit rate of in the prior year

as a result  during  all of the remaining capitalized implementation costs related to these two hr management contracts were written off and a portion of the previously received and deferred implementation revenue related to the services not yet operational was recognized 
refer to the deferred charges section of note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for detailed discussion on our policy related to evaluation of our deferred costs

costs and expenses in  we recorded of asset impairment and implementation charges at hr management  of which related to impairment of deferred charges  related to goodwill impairment and related to expensing of implementation costs 
the charges reflect challenges we experienced with complex implementations primarily pertaining to two large contracts which caused an increase in overall implementation and delivery costs and an assessment of capitalized implementation expenses and goodwill 
the impairment of deferred charges recorded in triggered an impairment review of the goodwill related to the hr management segment 
as discussed more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
we determined that the fair value of the hr management segment was less than its carrying value as of september  and  therefore  the second step of the test was required 
this second step review of the hr management segment was completed during the fourth quarter of and resulted in non cash goodwill impairment charge of recorded within the asset impairment caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in determining the amount of the hr management related goodwill impairment  we engaged a third party appraisal firm to assist in valuing the significant intangible assets of the reporting unit 
key assumptions used by the company in determining the fair value of the hr management segment included revenue increases from existing contracts as services become operational and an estimate of future cash implementation costs and revenue

the company uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company 
the company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations  such as investment in the company s existing businesses 
further  free cash flow facilitates management s ability to strengthen the company s balance sheet  to repay the company s debt obligations and to repurchase the company s common shares 
limitations associated with the use of free cash flow include that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it does not incorporate certain cash payments including payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions 
management compensates for these limitations by utilizing both the non gaap measure  free cash flow  and the gaap measure  net cash flows from operating activities  in its evaluation of performance 
there are no material purposes for which we use this non gaap measure beyond the purposes described above 
capital resources  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual commitments at december   total capitalization was  consisting of of short term and long term debt and  of equity 
at december   total capitalization was  consisting of of short term and long term debt and  of equity 
the total debt to capital ratio at december   was  which compares to at december  the decrease in this ratio is due to a lower level of borrowings in compared to at december   we have borrowed the entire amount available under our five year competitive advance and revolving credit facility 
this borrowing was used mainly to fund our acquisition of intervoice that closed on september  the maturity date of the revolving credit facility agreement is october  the company s credit facility includes certain restrictive covenants including maintenance of interest coverage and debt to ebitda ratios as defined in the credit facility agreement 
our interest coverage ratio  defined as the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense  cannot be less than to for four consecutive quarters 
our debt to ebitda ratio cannot be greater than to at any time 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
during february  we repaid of the outstanding portion of the revolving credit facility 
in december  we issued in unsecured senior notes senior notes due december  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  during the first nine months of  we retired approximately of the outstanding convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents debt and announced an exchange offer exchange offer  under the terms of which the company offered to exchange one thousand twenty dollars in principal amount of its new junior subordinated convertible debentures due september convertible debentures for each one thousand dollars in principal amount of its senior notes 
we issued a total of aggregate principal amount of the convertible debentures in exchange for of the senior notes 
this exchange transaction resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of that is reflected within other income expense  net  in the accompanying statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for the year ended december  following the settlement of the exchange  approximately aggregate principal amount of the senior notes remained outstanding that was fully paid in december as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we lease certain facilities and equipment used in our operations under operating leases 
this includes our office complex in orlando  florida  which is leased from wachovia development corporation lessor  a wholly owned subsidiary of wells fargo company  under an agreement that expires in june upon termination or expiration of the lease  we must either purchase the property from the lessor for or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party 
if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount less than the  we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount in excess of  convergys is entitled to collect the excess 
as of december   we have recognized a liability of approximately for the related residual value guarantee 
the value of the guarantee was determined by computing the estimated present value of probability weighted cash flows that might be expended under the guarantee 
the company recorded a liability for the fair value of the obligation with a corresponding asset recorded as prepaid rent  which is being amortized to rental expense over the lease term 
the liability will remain on the balance sheet until the end of the lease term 
under the terms of the lease  the company also provides certain indemnities to the lessor  including environmental indemnities 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount of such exposure or the fair value 
convergys does not expect such amounts  if any  to be material 
the company has concluded that we are not required to consolidate the lessor pursuant to authoritative guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities included within fasb topic  consolidation  in the asc 
we are in the process of evaluating whether to purchase or refinance this property 
during  we entered into a asset securitization facility collateralized by accounts receivables of certain of the company s subsidiaries  of which expires in june and expires in june the asset securitization program is conducted through convergys funding inc  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote subsidiary of the company 
the asset securitization facility does not qualify for sale treatment under the authoritative guidance for the accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities included in fas topic  transfers and servicing  in the asc 
accordingly  the accounts receivable and related debt obligation will remain on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   this facility remains undrawn 
during february  we drew approximately from this facility 
the company currently believes that its ability to borrow is greater than its established credit facilities in place 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during we repurchased million shares of our common stock for during pursuant to outstanding authorizations 
the timing and terms of any future transactions depend on a number of considerations including market conditions and our liquidity 
at december   we had the authority to repurchase an additional million common shares

in order to meet erisa funding requirements  the company expects to contribute to fund its cash balance pension plan in there is no estimate available for and beyond 
unrecognized tax benefits of are excluded from this table as the uncertainty related to the amount and period of any cash settlement prevent the company from making a reasonably reliable estimate 
this consists of contractual obligations to purchase services that are enforceable and legally binding 
excludes issuance of purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are short term or cancelable  as well as renewable support and maintenance arrangements 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately related to performance and payment guarantees  of which approximately is set to expire by the end of  approximately is set to expire within one to three years and approximately is set to expire after three years 
we also had other bond obligations of approximately related to performance and payment guarantees 
we do not believe that any obligation that may arise under these arrangements will be material 
market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   we had in outstanding variable rate borrowings and in outstanding fixed rate borrowings 
the carrying amount of our variable borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
our variable interest rate debt had an effective interest rate of during the year ended december  based upon our exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change our annual interest expense by approximately we sometimes use interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding interest rate swaps covering interest rate exposure at december  foreign currency exchange rate risk we serve many of our us based clients using contact center capacity in the philippines  india and canada 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in philippine pesos php  indian rupees inr or canadian dollars cad  which represents a foreign exchange exposure 
as of december   we have hedged a portion of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in these convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents foreign currencies by entering into forward contracts with several financial institutions to acquire a total of php  at a fixed price of through september  inr  at a fixed price of through june and cad at a fixed price of through december additionally  we had entered into option contracts to purchase php  for a fixed price of through june the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency 
we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect the company against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables  payables and intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the company or the respective subsidiaries 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments in these areas based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
we have identified below the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical in compiling our statements of financial condition and operating results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
contingencies the company is from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings that are filed in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that the results of any such claims or administrative proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will not have a materially adverse effect on the results of operations or our financial condition 
however  the outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending matters could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or our financial condition in the future 
deferred charges in connection with our outsourcing arrangements  we often perform a significant amount of set up activities or implementations  which include the installation and customization of our proprietary software in our centers 
under these arrangements  clients do not take possession of the software nor have the right to take possession of the software without incurring a significant penalty 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  the implementations are not treated as separate elements for revenue recognition purposes 
any proceeds collected for the implementations are deferred and recognized over the service period 
additionally  with respect to certain multiple element arrangements  we defer all revenue related to the contracts until the final element is delivered 
we capitalize all direct and incremental implementation and multiple element costs  convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts to the extent recovery is probable  and amortize them ratably over the life of the arrangements as cost of providing services and products sold 
deferred amounts are periodically evaluated for impairment or when circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amounts 
in the event these costs are not deemed recoverable  we follow the guidance in fasb topic  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  in the asc  to determine whether an impairment exists 
we evaluate the probability of recovery by considering profits to be earned during the term of the contract  the creditworthiness of the client and  if applicable  contract termination penalties payable by the client in the event that the client terminates the contract early 
our estimate of profitability is dependent in large part on our estimate of costs 
although we make every reasonable effort to accurately estimate costs  revisions may be made based on actual costs incurred that could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
additionally  if the financial condition of a client were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  we may be unable to recover the costs  which would result in an impairment loss 
finally  our entitlement to termination fees may be subject to challenge if a client were to allege that we were in breach of contract 
the implementation related  settlement and asset impairment charges of recognized during substantially reflect a the costs of implementing an hr management outsourcing client contract that exceeded the amount recoverable under the contract and b impairment of deferred costs resulting from a decision by two large hr management clients not to implement services that were not operational 
during  we recorded of impairment and implementation charges related to deferred costs  of which was due to impairment of deferred charges and was due to expensing of implementation costs that exceeded the termination for convenience fees in a contract at september  based on our evaluation of all the related contracts  we believe that the remaining of deferred charges at december  is recoverable 
goodwill at december   we had goodwill with a net carrying value of  as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  fair value is based on actual stock price or transaction prices of comparable companies 
the market approach requires significant judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant judgment including estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
asset impairment charges recorded during and required a review of goodwill related to the hr management segment both in and the review performed in did not result in any goodwill impairment  however the review performed in resulted in an impairment loss of at hr management 
the goodwill impairment loss of for is reflected in the asset impairment caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment tests for the five reporting units information management international  information convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents management north america  customer management  relationship technology management and hr management 
based on the results of the first step  we had no goodwill impairment related to any of our reporting units 
we believe we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we accurately estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
however  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in impairment losses 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with fasb topic  income taxes  in the asc asc  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the company s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its tax activities and records a liability for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc the guidance contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit  which is the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our liability for uncertain tax positions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be significantly different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgments and estimates 
restructuring charges we account for restructuring charges in accordance with fasb topic  exit or disposal cost obligations  in the asc  recognizing liabilities for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
during the last three years  we have recorded restructuring charges related to reductions in headcount and facility closures 
as of december   we had a restructuring accrual of  of which relates to facility closure costs that will be paid over several years until the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with the abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
we have used estimates  based on consultation with real estate advisors  to arrive at the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
we will continue to evaluate our estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our revenues is derived from transactions that require a significant level of judgment 
this includes percentage of completion we recognize some software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of cost of providing services and products sold 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
license arrangements the accounting for our license and support and maintenance arrangements can be complex and requires a significant amount of judgment 
some of the factors that we must assess include the separate elements of the arrangement  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the various undelivered elements of the arrangement  whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  whether the fees are considered collectible and whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
multiple element outsourcing arrangements hr management  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  delivers multiple services under our client arrangements eg  benefits administration  recruiting  payroll and learning 
in connection with these arrangements  we must assess these multiple element arrangements to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis 
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are met  each of the contractual services included in the contract is treated as a separate unit of accounting and revenue is recognized as we deliver each of the contractual services 
if these criteria are not met  all of the services included are accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
revenue is then recognized either using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis once hr management begins to deliver the final service 
the assessments of these areas require us to make a significant number of judgments 
the judgments made in these areas could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents the timing of the revenue recognized 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
other we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans  self insurance accruals and assessing recoverability of intangible assets

the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu or asu on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
risks relating to convergys and its business client consolidations could result in a loss of clients and adversely affect our operating results 
we serve clients in industries that have experienced a significant level of consolidation 
we cannot assure that additional consolidations will not occur in which our clients acquire additional businesses or are acquired themselves 
such consolidations may result in the termination of an existing client contract  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
at t  our largest client  has substantially migrated its subscribers from the legacy wireless billing system that we supported through a managed services agreement onto at t s other wireless billing system 
the migration began in and was substantially complete by the end of in addition  at t acquired several other convergys clients  resulting in their migration to the other billing system 
the loss of revenue resulting from the at t related migrations was approximately in compared to our information management revenues 
in september  sprint pcs  a large data processing outsourcing client  completed its acquisition of nextel communications 
in  sprint nextel informed us that it intended to consolidate its billing systems onto a competitor s system 
the migration began in and was fully completed during revenues from sprint nextel were down approximately for compared to the corresponding period last year 
a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients in the communications industry  and the loss of one or more of our clients  or weakness in the communications industry  could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
our three largest clients  as discussed under the section above titled client concentration  collectively represented of our revenues for our relationship convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents with at t is represented by separate contracts work orders with customer management and information management 
our relationships with directv and comcast corporation are represented by contracts under customer management 
we do not believe that it is likely that our entire relationship with at t would terminate at one time  and  therefore  we are not substantially dependent on any particular contract work order 
however  the loss of all of the contracts work orders with a particular client at the same time or the loss of one or more of the larger contracts work orders with a client would adversely affect our total revenues if the revenues from such client were not replaced with revenues from that client or other clients 
our revenues and earnings would also be negatively impacted by general weakness or slowdown in the communications industry 
a large portion of our accounts receivable is payable by a limited number of clients and the inability of any of these clients to pay its accounts receivable could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable 
as of december   our largest clients  at t  directv and comcast corporation  collectively accounted for of our accounts receivable 
during the past five years  each of these clients has generally paid its accounts receivable on a timely basis  and write downs that we have incurred in connection with such accounts receivable were consistent with write downs that we incurred with other clients 
we anticipate that several clients will continue to account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable 
although we currently do not expect payment issues with any of these clients  if any of them were unable or unwilling  for any reason  to pay our accounts receivable  our income would decrease 
we have several important clients that are in industries  including automotive  that have been severely impacted by the current global economic slowdown 
we also carry significant receivable balances with other clients whose declaration of bankruptcy could decrease our income 
in addition  our income could be materially impacted by a number of small clients declaring bankruptcy in a short period of time 
if our clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource and the prices that they are willing to pay for such services may diminish and could result in a reduction of our revenues and earnings 
our revenues depend on the success of our clients 
if our clients or their specific programs are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource may be diminished 
thus  although we have signed contracts  many of which contain minimum revenue commitments  to provide services to our clients  there can be no assurance that the level of revenues generated by such contracts will meet expectations 
this could result in stranded capacity and additional costs 
in addition  we may face pricing pressure from clients  which could negatively affect our operating results 
revenues in most of our larger hr management contracts are partially based on our clients headcount 
our revenues could be negatively impacted by headcount reductions and restructuring actions taken by our clients 
we process  transmit and store personally identifiable information and unauthorized access to or the unintended release of this information could result in a claim for damage or loss of business and create unfavorable publicity 
we process  transmit and store personally identifiable information  both in our role as a service provider and as an employer 
this information may include social security numbers  financial and health information  as well as other personal information 
as a result  we are subject to certain contractual terms  as well as federal  state and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect personally identifiable information 
we take measures to protect against unauthorized access and to comply with these laws and regulations 
we use the internet as a mechanism for delivering our services to clients  which may expose us to potential disruptive intrusions 
unauthorized access  system denials of service  or failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations may subject us to contractual liability and damages  loss of business  damages from individual claimants  fines  penalties  criminal prosecution convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts and unfavorable publicity  any of which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  third party vendors that we engage to perform services for us may have an unintended release of personally identifiable information 
our ability to deliver our services is at risk if the technology and network equipment that we rely upon is not maintained or upgraded in a timely manner 
technology is a critical foundation in our service delivery 
we utilize and deploy internally developed and third party software solutions across various hardware environments 
we operate an extensive internal voice and data network that links our global sites together in a multi hub model that enables the rerouting of traffic 
also  we rely on multiple public communication channels for connectivity to our clients 
maintenance of and investment in these foundational components are critical to our success 
if the reliability of technology or network operations falls below required service levels  or a systemic fault affects the organization broadly  business from our existing and potential clients may be jeopardized and cause our revenue to decrease 
emergency interruption of data centers and customer management and hr management contact centers could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our data or contact centers  through casualty  operating malfunction or other causes  we may be unable to provide the data processing  customer management and hr management services we are contractually obligated to deliver 
this could result in us being required to pay contractual damages to some clients or to allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts 
notwithstanding disaster recovery and business continuity plans and precautions instituted to protect our clients and us from events that could interrupt delivery of services including property and business interruption insurance that we maintain  there is no guarantee that such interruptions would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide support services to our clients or that such precautions would adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur as a result of such interruptions 
defects or errors within our software could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
design defects or software errors may delay software introductions or reduce the satisfaction level of clients and may have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our software is highly complex and may  from time to time  contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and or correct 
since both our clients and we use our software to perform critical business functions  design defects  software errors or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise from the use of our software 
it may also result in financial or other damages to our clients  for which we may be held responsible 
although our license agreements with our clients may often contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from client problems  these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions 
claims and liabilities arising from client problems could result in monetary damages to us and could cause damage to our reputation  adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
if the global trend toward outsourcing does not continue  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
revenue growth depends  in large part  on the trend toward outsourcing  particularly as it relates to our customer management operations 
outsourcing involves companies contracting with a third party  such as convergys  to provide customer management services rather than performing such services in house 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as organizations may elect to perform such services in house 
a significant change in this trend could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents we are susceptible to business and political risks from domestic and international operations that could result in reduced revenues or earnings 
we operate a global business and have facilities located throughout north and south america  europe  the middle east and the asian pacific region 
as part of our strategy  we plan to capture more of the international bss and customer management markets 
additionally  north american companies require off shore customer management outsourcing capacity 
as a result  we expect to continue expansion through start up operations and acquisitions in foreign countries 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional countries will require management attention and financial resources 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that we are adversely affected by these risks  our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and or earnings could be reduced 
in addition  there has been political discussion and debate related to worldwide competitive sourcing  labor related legislation and information flow restrictions  particularly from the united states to off shore locations 
federal and state legislation has been proposed that relates to this issue 
future legislation  if enacted  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in particular  proposed legislation  known as the employee free choice act  if enacted in its current form or a similar variation thereof  could make it easier for union organizing drives to be successful and could give third party arbitrators the ability to impose terms of collective bargaining upon both the company and a labor union if the parties are unable to agree to the terms of a collective bargaining agreement within specified timelines 
our earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency 
customer management serves an increasing number of its us based clients using contact center capacity in the philippines  india and canada 
about one half of our approximately  contact center employees are located outside the united states 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred by customer management to render services under these contracts is denominated in philippine pesos  indian rupees or canadian dollars  which represents a foreign exchange exposure to the company 
we enter into forward exchange contracts and options to limit potential foreign currency exposure 
as the us dollar weakens the operating expenses of these contact centers  translated into us dollars  increase 
the increase in operating expenses will be partially offset by gains realized through the settlement of the hedged instruments 
as the derivative instruments that limit our potential foreign currency exposures are entered into over a period of several years  the overall impact to earnings will be determined by both the timing of the derivative instruments and the movement of the us dollar 
in addition to the impact on our operating expenses that support dollar denominated customer management contracts  changes in foreign currency impact the results of our international business units that are located outside of north america 
in  of our revenues were generated outside of north america 
if we do not effectively manage our capacity  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to profit from the global trend toward outsourcing depends largely on how effectively we manage our customer management and hr management contact center capacity 
in order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects  we may need to open new contact centers 
the opening or expansion of a contact center may result  at least in the short term  in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program 
expanded use of home agents is helping to mitigate this risk 
we periodi convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts cally assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our contact centers 
as a result  we may  if deemed necessary  consolidate  close or partially close under performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity 
as part of our effort to consolidate our facilities  we seek to sublease a portion of our surplus space  if any  and recover certain costs associated with it 
to the extent that we fail to sublease such surplus space  our expenses will increase 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of our business  our ability to execute our business plans in those areas could be impaired and revenues could decrease 
we employ approximately  employees worldwide 
at times  we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the desired levels of training or experience 
additionally  in regard to the labor intensive business of customer management  quality service depends on our ability to retain employees and control personnel turnover 
any increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs and could decrease operating effectiveness and productivity 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects 
because a significant portion of our operating costs relates to labor costs  an increase in wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
war and terrorist attacks or other civil disturbances could lead to economic weakness and could disrupt our operations resulting in a decrease of our revenues and earnings 
in the recent past  war and terrorist attacks have caused uncertainty in the global financial markets and economy 
additional attacks and wars could contribute to economic instability in the united states and disrupt our operations in the us and abroad 
such disruptions could cause service interruptions or reduce the quality level of the services that we provide  resulting in a reduction of our revenues 
these activities may also cause our clients to delay or defer decisions regarding their use of our services and  thus  delay receipt of additional revenues 
in addition  war and terrorist attacks in other regions could disrupt our operations and or create economic uncertainty with our clients  which could cause a reduction in revenues and earnings 
general economic and market conditions may adversely affect our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations 
our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 
economic slowdowns in some markets  particularly in the united states  may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients  which may result in reductions in the growth of new business as well as reductions in existing business 
if our clients enter bankruptcy or liquidate their operations  our revenues could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that weakening economic conditions throughout the world will not adversely impact our results of operations  cash flow and or financial position 
further deterioration in equity markets will reduce the funded status of our pension plan  which will increase future required contributions 
reduced demand for our services could increase price competition 
we need to maintain adequate liquidity in order to have sufficient cash to meet operating cash flow requirements and to repay maturing debt and other obligations 
if we fail to comply with the covenants contained in our various borrowing agreements  it may adversely affect our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
our liquidity is a function of our ability to successfully generate cash flows from a combination of operations and access to capital markets 
as of december   total cash and cash equivalents was we believe our liquidity including operating and other cash flows that we expect to generate will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and required debt repayments as convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents they occur  however  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity going forward depends on our ability to generate cash from operations and access capital markets 
as further described in the capital resources section of the management discussion and analysis  our revolving credit agreement  which was fully drawn at december   contains certain restrictive covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants in the agreements 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by litigation and other commitments and contingencies 
the company faces risks arising from various unasserted and asserted litigation matters  including  but not limited to  commercial  securities law and patent infringement claims 
unfavorable outcomes in pending litigation matters  or in future litigation  could negatively affect us 
aggressive plaintiffs counsel often file litigation on a wide variety of allegations  and even when the allegations are groundless  we may need to expend considerable funds and other resources to respond to such litigation 
in the ordinary course of business  we may make certain commitments  including representations  warranties and indemnities relating to current and past operations  including those related to acquired or divested businesses and issue guarantees of third party obligations 
if we were required to make payments as a result of any of these matters  they could exceed the amounts accrued  thereby adversely affecting our results of operations  cash flows  financial condition  or business 
our failure to successfully integrate or acquire businesses could cause our business to suffer 
our expansion and growth may be dependent in part on our ability to make acquisitions 
the risks we face related to acquisitions include that we could overpay for acquired businesses  face integration challenges  have difficulty finding appropriate acquisition candidates  and any acquired business could significantly under perform relative to our expectations 
if acquisitions are not successfully integrated  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected as well as adversely impact our reputation 
our board of directors reviews our businesses  including acquired businesses  on an ongoing basis to assess how and to what extent they contribute to our strategic goals 
businesses that they determine are not strategic could be divested at any time 
our debt ratings are not considered investment grade 
in  both moody s and standard and poor s downgraded our debt ratings to below investment grade 
this could impact our ability to raise capital in the future as well as increase borrowing costs 
in addition  prospective clients and vendors may be less willing to do business with a provider with higher perceived credit risk or demand more onerous terms 
we may incur additional non cash goodwill impairment charges in the future 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill for impairment annually as of october and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicates the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
although no goodwill impairment charges were recorded during  during we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of there can be no assurances that we will not incur additional charges in the future  particularly in the event of a prolonged economic slowdown 
we sometimes rely on business partners to market  develop and deliver our solutions 
their failure to perform could negatively impact our financial results and harm our reputation in the marketplace 
we use third party business partners to assist in project implementations  to provide components of our solutions and to expand our ability to sell into new markets 
failure of third parties to perform in a timely manner could result in contractual or regulatory penalties  project delays or cost overruns as well as a failure to close new business 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amounts in millions except per share amounts our accounting for our long term contracts requires using estimates and projections that may change over time 
such changes may have a significant or adverse effect on our reported results of operations and consolidated balance sheet 
projecting contract profitability on our long term outsourcing contracts requires us to make assumptions and estimates of future contract results 
all estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to change 
in an effort to maintain appropriate estimates  we review each of our long term outsourcing contracts  the related contract reserves and intangible assets on a regular basis 
if we determine that we need to change our estimates for a contract  we will change the estimates in the period in which the determination is made 
these assumptions and estimates involve the exercise of judgment and discretion  which may also evolve over time in light of operational experience  regulatory direction  developments in accounting principles and other factors 
further  initially foreseen effects could change over time as a result of changes in assumptions  estimates or developments in the business or the application of accounting principles related to long term outsourcing contracts 
any such changes may have a significant or adverse effect on our reported results of operations and consolidated balance sheet 
the outsourcing and consulting markets in which we operate include a large number of service providers and are highly competitive 
many of our competitors are expanding the services they offer in an attempt to gain additional business 
in addition  new competitors  alliances among competitors or mergers of competitors could emerge and gain significant market share and some of our competitors may have or may develop a lower cost structure  adopt more aggressive pricing policies or provide services that gain greater market acceptance than the services that we offer or develop 
large and well capitalized competitors may be able to better respond to the need for technological changes faster  price their services more aggressively  compete for skilled professionals  finance acquisitions  fund internal growth and compete for market share 
in order to respond to increased competition and pricing pressure  we may have to lower our pricing structure  which would have an adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin 
our business performance and growth plans may be negatively affected if we are unable to manage effectively changes in the application and use of technology 
the utilization of technology in our industry has and will continue to increase rapidly 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with continuing changes in technology  industry standards and client preferences 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost effective basis  and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace 
additionally  the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses 
if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost effective technologies  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete customer engagements 
also  if customer preferences for technology significantly disproportionately outpace other interaction preferences  it could have a material adverse impact on our revenue profile and growth plans
