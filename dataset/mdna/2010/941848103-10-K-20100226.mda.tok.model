this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing changes in temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
the accounting standard for income taxes requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 
in addition  the company accounts for its uncertain tax return reporting positions in accordance with the income taxes accounting standard  which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances  but it prohibits any discounting of any of the related tax effects for the time value of money

pension and other retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are evaluated and updated annually 
the company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be for its us benefit plans and for its us benefit plans 

table of contents at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody s aa interest rate as of december  that best matched the timing of the plan s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
once the interest rates were determined  the plan s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date

stock based compensation the accounting standard for stock based compensation requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
the company has used the black scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
this accounting standard requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of this accounting standard  the compensation expense that the company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under the stock based compensation accounting standard and  consequently  has not adjusted results from prior years 
under the modified transition method  compensation costs now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december  and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december  the company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method

in october  a new accounting consensus was issued for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this consensus amends existing revenue recognition accounting standards 
this consensus provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previously the existing accounting consensus required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
under the existing accounting consensus  if the fair value of all of the 
table of contents elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined

the company documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items and links all derivatives designated as fair value  cash flow or net investment hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the consolidated 
table of contents balance sheets or to specific forecasted transactions 
in addition  the company considers the impact of its counterparties credit risk on the fair value of the contracts as well as the ability of each party to execute under the contracts 
the company also assesses and documents  both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows associated with the hedged items
