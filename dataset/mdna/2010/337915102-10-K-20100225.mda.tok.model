net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities  the mix of funding between interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the million decrease in net interest income occurred because the million decrease in interest income was more than the million decrease in interest expense during the same period 
for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a fte basis  to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
that is  interest on tax free securities and tax exempt loans has been restated as if such interest were taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of adjusted for the non deductible portion of interest expense incurred to acquire the tax free assets

in december  the corporation corrected an error in hedge accounting for a portfolio of interest rate swaps associated with fixed rate commercial loans recorded in prior periods 
the corporation assessed the materiality of the error in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
and concluded the error was not material  either individually or in the aggregate  to the results of operations of any prior period or for the year ending december   to trends for those periods affected  or to a fair presentation of the corporation s financial statements for those periods 
accordingly  results for prior periods have not been restated

table of contents financial condition investment securities at december   the securities portfolio totaled billion  million of that amount was held to maturity securities and the remainder was securities available for sale 
in comparison  as of december   the total portfolio was billion  including million of held to maturity securities and billion of securities available for sale 
available for sale securities are held primarily for liquidity  interest rate risk management and long term yield enhancement 
accordingly  the corporation s investment policy is to invest in securities with low credit risk  such as us treasury securities  us government agency obligations  state and political obligations and mortgage backed securities mbss 
held to maturity securities consist principally of securities issued by state and political subdivisions 
other investments include federal home loan bank fhlb and federal reserve bank frb stock 
net unrealized gains were million at december   compared to million at december  the improvement in the fair value of the investment securities is driven by government agency securities held in portfolio 
the corporation conducts a regular assessment of its investment securities to determine whether any securities are other than temporary impaired 
only the credit portion of other than temporary impairment otti is to be recognized in current earnings for those securities where there is no intent to sell or it is more likely than not the corporation would not be required to sell the security prior to expected recovery 
the remaining portion of otti is to be included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of income tax 
gross unrealized losses of million as of december   compared to million at december  were concentrated within trust preferred securities held in portfolio 
the corporation holds eight  single issuer  trust preferred securities 
such investments are less than of the fair value of the entire investment portfolio 
none of the bank issuers have deferred paying dividends on their issued trust preferred shares in which the corporation is invested 
the fair values of these investments have been impacted by market conditions which have caused risk premiums to increase markedly resulting in the decline in the fair value of the corporation s trust preferred securities

allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments the corporation maintains what management believes is an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the corporation and firstmerit bank regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowance through ongoing review of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  nonperforming assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements provide detailed information regarding the corporation s credit policies and practices 
the corporation uses a vendor based loss migration model to forecast losses for commercial loans 
the model creates loss estimates using twelve month monthly rolling vintages and calculates cumulative three years loss rates within two different scenarios 
one scenario uses five year historical performance data while the other one uses two year historical data 
the calculated rate is the average cumulative expected loss of the two and five year data set 
as a result  this approach lends more weight to the more recent performance and would be more conservative 
the uncertain economic conditions in which we are currently operating have resulted in risks that differ from our historical loss experience 
accordingly  management deemed it appropriate and prudent to apply qualitative factors q factors and assign additional reserves 
these q factors are supported by judgments made by experienced credit risk management personnel and represent risk associated with the portfolio given the uncertainty and the inherent imprecision of estimating future losses 
at december  the allowance for loan losses was million or of loans outstanding  compared to million or at year end the allowance equaled of nonperforming loans at year end compared to at year end during additional reserves were established to address identified risks associated with the slow down in the housing markets and the decline in residential and commercial real estate values 
these reserves totaled million at year end and million at year end the increase in the 
table of contents additional allocation augmented the increase in the calculated loss migration analysis as the loans were downgraded during nonperforming loans have increased by million over december  primarily attributable to the declining economic conditions 
as required by current accounting guidance  the acquired abl loans from fbbc were recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition  with no carryover of related allowances 
the determination of the fair value of the abl loans resulted in a write down in the value of the loans  which was assigned to an accretable balance with the accretable balance being recognized as interest income over the remaining term of the loan 
because acquired loans are required to be accounted for at fair value on the date of acquisition  management believes that asset quality measures excluding the acquired abl loans are generally more meaningful 
therefore  the asset quality ratios included herein exclude these acquired abl loans 
net charge offs were million in compared to million in and million including the loans held for sale in as a percentage of average loans outstanding  net charge offs and allowance for loans held for sale equaled in  in and in losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses as soon as they are identified

interest rate risk on the corporation s balance sheets consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options  and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the corporation 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools  including earnings simulation modeling and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis  which capture both near term and long term interest rate risk exposures 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
net interest income simulation analysis 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks  gradual ramps  curve flattening  curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios 
presented below is the corporation s interest rate risk profile as of december  immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in net interest income basis basis basis basis points points points points december  december  modeling for the decrease in basis points scenario has been suspended due to the current rate environment 
modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed  actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected 
the assumptions used in the models are management s best estimate based on studies conducted by the alco department 
the alco department uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously 
assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg  savings  
table of contents money market and interest bearing checking accounts  balance trends  and repricing relationships reflect management s best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly 
economic value of equity modeling 
the corporation also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis 
alco uses economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on balance sheet and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the corporation s economic value of equity 
the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario  which will impact the discounted present value 
the amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet 
presented below is the corporation s eve profile as of december  and immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in eve basis basis basis basis points points points points december  december  modeling for the decrease in basis points scenario has been suspended due to the current rate environment 
management takes corrective action if this analysis indicates that the corporation s eve will change by more than in response to an immediate basis point increase in interest rates or eve will change by more than in response to an immediate basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the corporation is operating within these guidelines 
interest rate sensitivity analysis 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion that it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the following analysis divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the analysis shows that assets maturing within one year exceed liabilities maturing within the same period by million 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within one year  the corporation was in a liability sensitive position at december  as illustrated in the following table 
over days days days days days year total in thousands interest earning assets loans and leases investment securities and federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings and money market accounts certificate and other time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase wholesale borrowings total interest bearing liabilities total gap cumulative gap management of interest rate exposure 
management uses the results of its various simulation analyses to formulate strategies to achieve desired risk profile within the parameters of the corporation s capital and liquidity 
table of contents guidelines 
specifically  management actively manages interest rate risk positions by using derivatives predominately in the form of interest rate swaps  which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities 
for more information about how the corporation uses interest rate swaps to manage its balance sheet  see note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivatives and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of the corporation being unable to meet current and future financial obligations as they come due at a reasonable cost 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit  deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities 
the corporation considers core earnings  strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings  which allow the corporation cost effective access to market based liquidity 
the corporation relies on a large  stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk 
the treasury group is responsible for identifying  measuring and monitoring the corporation s liquidity profile 
the position is evaluated daily  weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources  reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months and identifying sources and uses of funds 
liquidity measures are reported monthly to alco and the board of directors in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors 
the treasury group also prepares a contingency funding plan that assesses liquidity needs that may arise from certain stress events 
furthermore  the company adopted a cash flow measurement approach to liquidity management in and models the demand and supply for funds under multiple stress scenarios 
the net result is then compared with the contingent sources for funds  which can also be altered via the model  to ensure sufficient funds are available 
the overall management of the corporation s liquidity position is then integrated into retail deposit pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base 
the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system 
core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december  the corporation also has available unused wholesale sources of liquidity  including advances from the fhlb of cincinnati  issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers 
liquidity is further provided by unencumbered  or unpledged  investment securities that totaled million at december  the corporation s liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect circumstances 
an example of a direct event would be a downgrade in the corporation s public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality  a large charge to earnings  a decline in profitability or other financial measures  or a significant merger or acquisition 
examples of indirect events unrelated to the corporation that could have an effect on its access to liquidity would be terrorism or war  natural disasters  political events  or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation  mutual fund or hedge fund 
similarly  market speculation or rumors about the corporation or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources 
the corporation s liquidity contingency plan outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis 
the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions 
it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period 
parent company liquidity the corporation manages its liquidity principally through dividends from the bank subsidiary 
the parent company has sufficient liquidity to service its debt  support customary corporate operations and activities including acquisitions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences  as well as pay dividends to shareholders 
during the year ended december   firstmerit bank paid million in dividends to firstmerit corporation 
as of december   firstmerit bank had an additional million available to pay dividends without regulatory approval 
recent market and regulatory developments 
recent market conditions have made it difficult or uneconomical to access the capital markets 
as a result  the united states congress  the treasury  and the fdic have announced various programs designed to enhance market liquidity and bank capital 

table of contents in response to the ongoing financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  eesa was signed into law on october  and established tarp 
as part of tarp  the treasury established the cpp to provide up to billion of funding to eligible financial institutions through the purchase of mortgages  mortgage backed securities  capital stock and other financial instruments for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  more commonly known as the economic stimulus or economic recovery package  was signed into law on february   by president obama 
arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients until the institution has repaid the treasury 
on january   the corporation completed the sale to the treasury of million of newly issued firstmerit non voting preferred shares as part of the cpp and a warrant to purchase  firstmerit common shares at an exercise price of per share 
on april   the corporation completed the repurchase of all  shares of its fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a for million which included all accrued and unpaid dividends as well as the unamortized discount on the preferred stock 
on may  the corporation completed the repurchase of the warrant held by the treasury 
the corporation paid million to the treasury to repurchase the warrant 
separately  the fdic announced its temporary liquidity guarantee program tlpg pursuant to which the fdic will guarantee the payment of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt of insured depository institutions debt guarantee and funds held at fdic insured depository institutions in noninterest bearing transaction accounts in excess of the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount of  transaction account guarantee 
both guarantees were provided to eligible institutions  including the corporation  at no cost through december  participation in the tlpg subsequent to december  was optional 
the corporation elected to participate in the tlpg subsequent to december  the transaction account guarantee is effective for the corporation through june  under the debt guarantee  qualifying senior unsecured debt newly issued by the corporation during the period from october  to june   inclusive  is covered by the fdic guarantee 
the maximum amount of debt that eligible institutions can issue under the guarantee is of the par value of the entity s qualifying senior unsecured debt  excluding debt to affiliates that was outstanding as of september   and scheduled to mature by june  the fdic will provide guarantee coverage until the earlier of the eligible debt s maturity or june  participants in the debt guarantee program are assessed an annualized fee of basis points for its participation  and an annualized fee of basis points for its participation in the transaction account guarantee 
to the extent that these initial assessments are insufficient to cover the expense or losses arising under tlpg  the fdic is required to impose an emergency special assessment on all fdic insured depository institutions as prescribed by the federal deposit insurance act 
in may  the fdic announced it was imposing an emergency special assessment of five basis points on average assets of all fdic insured depository institutions as of june  on november   the fdic adopted a final rule requiring insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of and for all of  and the prepaid assessments for these periods were collected on december   along with the regular quarterly risk based deposit insurance assessment for the third quarter of for the fourth quarter of and for all of  the prepaid assessment rate was based on each institution s total basis point assessment in effect on september   adjusted to assume a annualized deposit growth rate  for the and periods the computation is adjusted by an additional three basis points increase in the assessment rate 
the three year prepayment for the corporation totaled million 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the corporation has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements

accounting standards requires that the liability be recorded at net present value while the future payments contained in this table have not been discounted 
critical accounting policies the corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which it operates 
all accounting policies are important  and all policies described in note summary of significant accounting policies provide a greater understanding of how the corporation s financial performance is recorded and reported 

table of contents some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a significant effect on the corporation s financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility 
the policies require management to exercise judgment and make certain assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
these assumptions and estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
management relies heavily on the use of judgment  assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions  including accounting for the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  derivative instruments and hedging activities  and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies 
a brief discussion of each of these areas follows 
acquired loans 
loan that are acquired are initially recorded at their acquisition date fair values 
the carryover of an allowance for credit losses is prohibited as any credit losses evident in the loans are to be included in the determination of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date 
acquired loans are evaluated for impairment according to the provisions of asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
acquired loans are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable that not all contractually required payments will be collected 
in the assessment of credit quality  numerous assumptions  interpretations and judgments must be made  based on internal and third party credit quality information and ultimately the determination as to the probability that all contractual cash flows will not be able to be collected 
this is a point in time assessment and inherently subjective due to the nature of the available information and judgment involved 
fair values for acquired loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that involves assumptions and judgments as to credit risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  liquidity risk  default rates  loss severity  payment speeds  collateral values and discount rate 
all of these factors are inherently subjective and can result in significant changes in the cash flow estimates over the life of the loan 
such changes may increase future earnings volatility due to increases or decreases in the accretable yield ie  excess of the expected cash flows over the estimated fair value recognized on the loan or the requirement to record an allowance for loan losses if the decline in expected cash flows is attributable to a decline in credit quality 
due to the accounting requirements of acquired loans  certain trends and credit statistics may be impacted if such loans are included 
we believe that excluding the acquired loans from the presentation of such statistics is more meaningful and representative of our ongoing operations and credit quality 
allowance for loan losses 
as explained in note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and allowance for loan losses to the consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this estimate is based on the current economy s impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans  as well as historical loss experience associated with homogenous pools of loans 
management s estimate of the allowance for the commercial portfolio could be affected by risk rating upgrades or downgrades as a result of fluctuations in the general economy  developments within a particular industry  or changes in an individual credit due to factors particular to that credit such as competition  management or business performance 
a reasonably possible scenario would be an estimated migration of lower risk related pass credits to criticized status which could increase the inherent losses by million 
for the consumer portfolio  where individual products are reviewed on a group basis or in loan pools  losses can be affected by such things as collateral value  loss severity  the economy  and other uncontrollable factors 
the consumer portfolio is largely comprised of loans that are secured by primary residences and home equity lines and loans 
a basis point increase in the estimated loss rates on the residential mortgage and home equity line and loan portfolios would increase the inherent losses by million 
the remaining consumer portfolio inherent loss analysis includes reasonably possible scenarios with estimated loss rates increasing by basis points  which would change the related inherent losses by million 
additionally the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for the entire portfolio may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and general economic conditions as evidenced by changes in interest rates  unemployment rates  bankruptcy filings  used car prices and real estate values 
while no one factor is dominant  each has the ability to result in actual loan losses which differ from originally estimated amounts 

table of contents the information presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 
income taxes 
management evaluates and assesses the relative risks and appropriate tax treatment of transactions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation of these relative risks 
changes to the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations being conducted by taxing authorities and changes to statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative risks of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  can affect deferred taxes and accrued taxes as well as the current period s income tax expense and can be material to the corporation s operating results for any particular reporting period 
note federal income taxes to the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the corporation s income taxes 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in various aspects of its business  the corporation uses derivative financial instruments to modify exposures to changes in interest rates and market prices for other financial instruments 
derivative instruments are required to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recorded directly in earnings 
to qualify for and maintain hedge accounting  the corporation must meet formal documentation and effectiveness evaluation requirements both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis 
the application of the hedge accounting policy requires strict adherence to documentation and effectiveness testing requirements  judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness  identification of similar hedged item groupings  and measurement of changes in the fair value of hedged items 
if in the future derivative financial instruments used by the corporation no longer qualify for hedge accounting  the impact on the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings could be significant 
when hedge accounting is discontinued  the corporation would continue to carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its fair value  however  for a cash flow derivative  changes in its fair value would be recorded in earnings instead of through other comprehensive income  and for a fair value derivative  the changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability would no longer be recorded through earnings 
see also note summary of significant accounting policies and note derivative and hedging activities of the consolidated financial statements 
valuation measurements 
valuation methodologies often involve a significant degree of judgment  particularly when there are no observable active markets for the items being valued 
investment securities  residential mortgage loans held for sale and derivatives are carried at fair value  which requires key judgments affecting how fair value for such assets and liabilities is determined 
in addition  the outcomes of valuations have a direct bearing on the carrying amounts of goodwill  mortgage servicing rights  and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
to determine the values of these assets and liabilities  as well as the extent to which related assets may be impaired  management makes assumptions and estimates related to discount rates  asset returns  prepayment rates and other factors 
the use of different discount rates or other valuation assumptions could produce significantly different results  which could affect the corporation s results of operations 
fair value measurement the corporation uses fair value measurements to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value and determine fair value disclosures 
additional information regarding fair value measurement is included in note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
the corporation is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the corporation has elected to test for goodwill impairment as of november th of each year 
the valuation and testing methodologies used in the corporation s analysis of goodwill impairment are summarized in note under the heading goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
the first step in testing for goodwill impairment is to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
the corporation s reporting units for purposes of this testing are its major lines of business  commercial  retail and wealth 
fair values of reporting units are estimated 
table of contents using a discounted cash flow analysis derived from internal earnings forecasts 
the primary assumptions management uses include earnings forecasts for five years  terminal values based on future growth rates  and discount rates that reflect the range of the corporation s market capitalization and a control premium 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the goodwill impairment analysis for its reporting units are reasonable  however  if actual results and market conditions differ from the assumptions or estimates used  the fair value of each reporting unit could change in the future 
the second step of impairment testing is necessary only if the carrying amount of either reporting unit exceeds its fair value  suggesting goodwill impairment 
in such a case  the corporation would estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit representing the unit s fair value and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit s net assets excluding goodwill 
any excess of the estimated purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on the corporation s analysis performed in the fourth quarter  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
mortgage servicing rights when the corporation sells mortgage loans in the secondary market  it may retain the right to service the loans sold in exchange for a servicing fee that is collected over the life of the loan as the payments are received from the borrower 
such amounts are initially capitalized as mortgage servicing rights on the consolidated balance sheets at current fair value 
mortgage servicing rights are remeasured at each subsequent reporting date using the amortization method 
under the amortization method  mortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
amortization is recorded in loan sales and servicing income 
at each reporting period  mortgage servicing rights are assessed for impairment based on fair value of those rights 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights typically rises as market interest rates increase and declines as market interest rates decrease  however  the extent to which this occurs depends in part on the magnitude of changes in market interest rates  and the differential between the then current market interest rates for mortgage loans and the mortgage interest rates included in the mortgage servicing portfolio 
since sales of mortgage servicing rights tend to occur in private transactions and the precise terms and conditions of the sales are typically not readily available  there is a limited market to refer to in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
as such  like other participants in the mortgage banking business  the corporation relies primarily on a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
the corporation utilizes a third party vendor to perform the modeling to estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights 
the corporation reviews the estimated fair values and assumptions used by the third party in the model on a quarterly basis 
the corporation also compares the estimates of fair value and assumptions to recent market activity and against its own experience 
prepayment speeds generally  when market interest rates decline and other factors favorable to prepayments occur there is a corresponding increase in prepayments as customers refinance existing mortgages under more favorable interest rate terms 
when a mortgage loan is prepaid the anticipated cash flows associated with servicing that loan are terminated  resulting in a reduction of the fair value of the capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
to the extent that actual borrower prepayments do not react as anticipated by the prepayment model ie  the historical data observed in the model does not correspond to actual market activity  it is possible that the prepayment model could fail to accurately predict mortgage prepayments and could result in significant earnings volatility 
to estimate prepayment speeds  the corporation utilizes a third party prepayment model  which is based upon statistically derived data linked to certain key principal indicators involving historical borrower prepayment activity associated with mortgage loans in the secondary market  current market interest rates and other factors  including the corporation s own historical prepayment experience 
for purposes of model valuation  estimates are made for each product type within the mortgage servicing rights portfolio on a monthly basis 
discount rate represents the rate at which expected cash flows are discounted to arrive at the net present value of servicing income 
discount rates will change with market conditions ie  supply vs 
demand and be reflective of the yields expected to be earned by market participants investing in mortgage servicing rights 
cost to service expected costs to service are estimated based upon the incremental costs that a market participant would use in evaluating the potential acquisition of mortgage servicing rights 

table of contents float income estimated float income is driven by expected float balances principal  interest and escrow payments that are held pending remittance to the investor or other third party and current market interest rates  including the six month average of the three month london inter bank offered rate libor index  which are updated on a monthly basis for purposes of estimating the fair value of mortgage servicing rights 
additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage servicing rights is included in note mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing activity to the consolidated financial statements 
pension and other postretirement benefits the corporation sponsors several qualified and nonqualified pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain of its employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by the corporation  within certain guidelines 
the corporation considers market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the corporation s pension administrative committee committee has developed a statement of investment policies and objectives statement to assist firstmerit and the investment managers of the pension plan in effectively supervising and managing the assets of the pension plan 
the investment philosophy contained in the statement sets the investment time horizon as long term and the risk tolerance level as slightly above average while requiring diversification among several asset classes and securities 
without sacrificing returns  or increasing risk  the statement recommends a limited number of investment manager relationships and permits both separate accounts and commingled investments vehicles 
based on the demographics  actuarial funding situation  business and financial characteristics and risk preference  the statement defines that the pension fund as a total return investor return and accordingly current income is not a key goal of the plan 
the pension asset allocation policy has set guidelines based on the plan s objectives  characteristics of the pension liabilities  industry practices  the current market environment  and practical investment issues 
the committee has decided to investment in traditional ie  publicly traded securities and not alternative asset classes eg  private equity  hedge funds  real estate  etc 
at this time 
assumed discount rates reflect the time value of money as of the measurement date in determining the present value of future cash outflows for pension and postretirement benefit payments 
the objective of setting a discount rate is to establish an obligation for postretirement benefits equivalent to an amount that  if invested in high quality fixed income securities  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the pension and postretirement benefits when due 
assumed discount rates are reevaluated at each measurement date 
if the general level of interest rates rises or declines  the assumed discount rates will change in a similar manner 
the method used to estimate the discount rate can be changed if facts and circumstances indicate that a different method would result in a better estimate of the discount rate 
as of december  cash flows specific to each plan along with the hewitt top quartile yield curve hewitt yield curve were used by the corporation as the basis for estimating the discount rate 
the hewitt yield curve provides the best estimate of cash flows from investment in high quality fixed income securities to be used to pay the corporation s pension and postretirement benefits when due 
prior to  the corporation established the discount rate using the moody s aa corporate bond rate moody s rate 
due to the significant decline in the percentage of all bond issues of at least aa quality over the past several years  moody s rate no longer provides the best estimate of cash flows from investment in high quality fixed income securities the primary assumptions used in determining the corporation s pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expenses are presented in note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions used by the corporation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions might materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations
