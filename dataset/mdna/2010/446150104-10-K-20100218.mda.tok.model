table of contents forward looking statements this report  including md a  contains certain forward looking statements  including certain plans  expectations  goals  projections  and statements  which are subject to numerous assumptions  risks  and uncertainties 
statements that do not describe historical or current facts  including statements about beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are intended to be subject to the safe harbor provided by section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of actual results could differ materially from those contained or implied by such statements for a variety of factors including deterioration in the loan portfolio could be worse than expected due to a number of factors such as the underlying value of the collateral could prove less valuable than otherwise assumed and assumed cash flows may be worse than expected  changes in economic conditions  movements in interest rates  competitive pressures on product pricing and services  success and timing of other business strategies  extended disruption of vital infrastructure  and the nature  extent  and timing of governmental actions and reforms  including existing and potential future restrictions and limitations imposed in connection with the troubled asset relief program s voluntary capital purchase plan or otherwise under the emergency economic stabilization act of all forward looking statements included in this release are based on information available at the time of the release 
huntington assumes no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
all forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and are based on information available at that time 
we assume no obligation to update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements were made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as required by federal securities laws 
as forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties  caution should be exercised against placing undue reliance on such statements 
risk factors we  like other financial companies  are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation  many of which are outside of our direct control  though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns 
among the risks assumed are credit risk  which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms  market risk  which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  and credit spreads  liquidity risk  which is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future obligations resulting from external macro market issues  investor and customer perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to the company such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues  and operational risk  which is the risk of loss due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  or ethical standards  and external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  and security risks 
more information on risk is set forth under the heading risk factors included in item a 
additional information regarding risk factors can also be found in the risk management and capital discussion 
critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish critical accounting policies and make accounting estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect amounts recorded and reported in our financial statements 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements lists significant accounting policies we use in the development and presentation of our financial statements 
this discussion and analysis  the significant accounting policies  and other financial statement 
table of contents disclosures identify and address key variables and other qualitative and quantitative factors necessary for an understanding and evaluation of our company  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
an accounting estimate requires assumptions about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the financial statements if a different amount within a range of estimates were used or if estimates changed from period to period 
estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time  and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results that differ from when those estimates were made 
the most significant accounting estimates and their related application are discussed below 
this analysis is included to emphasize that estimates are used in connection with the critical and other accounting policies and to illustrate the potential effect on the financial statements if the actual amount were different from the estimated amount 
total allowances for credit losses the acl is the sum of the alll and the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit aulc  and represents the estimate of the level of reserves appropriate to absorb inherent credit losses 
the amount of the acl was determined by judgments regarding the quality of each individual loan portfolio and loan commitments 
all known relevant internal and external factors that affected loan collectibility were considered  including analysis of historical charge off experience  migration patterns  changes in economic conditions  and changes in loan collateral values 
such factors are subject to regular review and may change to reflect updated performance trends and expectations  particularly in times of severe stress such as have been experienced throughout we believe the process for determining the acl considers all of the potential factors that could result in credit losses 
however  the process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change 
there is no certainty that the acl will be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of continued adverse changes in the economy  market conditions  or events adversely affecting specific customers  industries or markets 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates  the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases  the risk profile of a market  industry  or group of customers changes materially  or if the acl is determined to not be adequate  additional provision for credit losses could be required  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  liquidity  capital  and results of operations in future periods 
at december   the acl was  million  or of total loans and leases 
to illustrate the potential effect on the financial statements of our estimates of the acl  a basis point increase would have required million in additional reserves funded by additional provision for credit losses  which would have negatively impacted net loss by approximately million  or per common share 
additionally  in  we established a specific reserve of million associated with our loans to franklin credit management corporation franklin 
at december   our specific alll for franklin loans increased to million 
in  as a result of our restructuring of the franklin relationship  the specific alll for franklin loans was eliminated 
refer to the franklin relationship section located within the risk management and capital section for additional discussion regarding the restructuring of the franklin relationship 
fair value measurements the fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
we estimate the fair value of a financial instrument using a variety of valuation methods 
where financial instruments are actively traded and have quoted market prices  quoted market prices are used for fair value 
we characterize active markets as those where transaction volumes are sufficient to provide objective pricing information  with reasonably narrow bid ask spreads  and where received quoted prices do not vary widely 
when the financial instruments are not actively traded  other observable market inputs  such as quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics  may be used  if available  to determine fair value 
inactive markets are characterized by low transaction volumes  price quotations that vary substantially among market participants  or in which minimal information is released publicly 
when observable market prices do not exist  
table of contents we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling methods 
our valuation methods consider factors such as liquidity and concentration concerns and  for the derivatives portfolio  counterparty credit risk 
other factors such as model assumptions  market dislocations  and unexpected correlations can affect estimates of fair value 
changes in these underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could materially impact the amount of revenue or loss recorded 
assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility 
assets measured at fair value include investment securities  loans held for sale  derivatives  mortgage servicing rights msrs  and trading account securities 
at december   approximately billion of our assets were recorded at fair value 
in addition to the above mentioned ongoing fair value measurements  fair value is also the unit of measure for recording business combinations 
the financial accounting standard board s fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  fair value measurements  establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of financial instruments that considers the attributes specific to particular assets or liabilities and establishes a three level hierarchy for determining fair value based on the transparency of inputs to each valuation as of the fair value measurement date 
the three levels are defined as follows level quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  quoted prices of identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs that are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
financial instruments are considered level when values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  and at least one significant model assumption or input is unoberservable 
at the end of each quarter  we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured 
from time to time  assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs to measure fair value at the measurement date 
the table below provides a description and the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value  as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 
the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy  as well as additional discussion regarding fair value measurements  can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
table fair value measurement of financial instruments financial instrument hierarchy valuation methodology mortgage loans held for sale level mortgage loans held for sale are estimated using security prices for similar product types 
investment securities trading account securities level consist of us treasury and other federal agency securities  and money market mutual funds which generally have quoted prices 
level consist of us government and agency mortgage backed securities and municipal securities for which an active market is not available 
third party pricing services provide a fair value estimate based upon trades of similar financial instruments 

table of contents financial instrument hierarchy valuation methodology level consist of asset backed securities and certain private label cmos  and residual interest in automobile securitizations  for which fair value is estimated 
assumptions used to determine the fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity due to the lack of observable market transactions 
generally  there are only limited trades of similar instruments and a discounted cash flow approach is used to determine fair value 
mortgage servicing rights msrs level msrs do not trade in an active  open market with readily observable prices 
although sales of msrs do occur  the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available 
fair value is based upon the final month end valuation  which utilizes the month end curve and prepayment assumptions 
derivatives level consist of exchange traded options and forward commitments to deliver mortgage backed securities which have quoted prices 
level consist of basic asset and liability conversion swaps and options  and interest rate caps 
these derivative positions are valued using internally developed models that use readily observable market parameters 
level consist primarily of interest rate lock agreements related to mortgage loan commitments 
the determinination of fair value includes assumptions related to the likelihood that a commitment will ultimately result in a closed loan  which is a significant unobservable assumption 
equity investments level consist of equity investments via equity funds holding both private and publicly traded equity securities  directly in companies as a minority interest investor  and directly in companies in conjunction with our mezzanine lending activities 
these investments do not have readily observable prices 
fair value is based upon a variety of factors  including but not limited to  current operating performance and future expectations of the particular investment  industry valuations of comparable public companies  and changes in market outlook

certain equity investments are accounted for under the equity method and  therefore  are not subject to the fair value disclosure requirements 
investment securities this section should be read in conjunction with the investment securities portfolio discussion and note and note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
level analysis on certain securities portfolios our alt a  cmo  and pooled trust preferred securities portfolios are classified as level  and as such  the significant estimates used to determine the fair value of these securities have greater subjectivity 
the alt a and cmo securities portfolios are subjected to a monthly review of the projected cash flows  while the cash flows of our pooled trust preferred securities portfolio are reviewed quarterly 
these reviews are supported 
table of contents with analysis from independent third parties  and are used as a basis for impairment analysis 
these three segments  and the results of our impairment analysis for each segment  are discussed in further detail below alt a mortgage backed private label collateralized mortgage obligation cmo securities  represent securities collateralized by first lien residential mortgage loans 
as the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of these securities in its entirety was a level input  we classified all securities within these portfolios as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the securities were priced with the assistance of an outside third party specialist using a discounted cash flow approach and the independent third party s proprietary pricing model 
the model used inputs such as estimated prepayment speeds  losses  recoveries  default rates that were implied by the underlying performance of collateral in the structure or similar structures  discount rates that were implied by market prices for similar securities  collateral structure types  and house price depreciation appreciation rates that were based upon macroeconomic forecasts 
we analyzed both our alt a mortgage backed and private label cmo securities portfolios to determine if the securities in these portfolios were other than temporarily impaired 
we used the analysis to determine whether we believed it is probable that all contractual cash flows would not be collected 
all securities in these portfolios remained current with respect to interest and principal at december  our analysis indicated  as of december   a total of alt a mortgage backed securities and private label cmo securities could experience a loss of principal in the future 
the future expected losses of principal on these other than temporarily impaired securities ranged from to of their par value 
these losses were projected to occur beginning anywhere from months to as many as years in the future 
we measured the amount of credit impairment on these securities using the cash flows discounted at each security s effective rate 
as a result  during the fourth quarter  we recorded million of credit other than temporary impairment otti in our alt a mortgage backed securities portfolio and million of credit otti in our private label cmo securities portfolio 
in  a total of million of credit otti was recorded in our alt a mortgage backed securities portfolio  and million of credit otti was recorded in our private label cmo securities portfolio 
these otti adjustments negatively impacted our earnings 
pooled trust preferred securities  represent collateralized debt obligations cdos backed by a pool of debt securities issued by financial institutions 
as the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of these securities in its entirety was a level input  we classified all securities within this portfolio as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the collateral generally consisted of trust preferred securities and subordinated debt securities issued by banks  bank holding companies  and insurance companies 
a full cash flow analysis was used to estimate fair values and assess impairment for each security within this portfolio 
impairment was calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the amount of cash flows discounted at each security s effective rate 
we engaged a third party specialist with direct industry experience in pooled trust preferred securities valuations to provide assistance in estimating the fair value and expected cash flows for each security in this portfolio 
relying on cash flows was necessary because there was a lack of observable transactions in the market and many of the original sponsors or dealers for these securities were no longer able to provide a fair value that was compliant with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the analysis was completed by evaluating the relevant credit and structural aspects of each pooled trust preferred security in the portfolio  including collateral performance projections for each piece of collateral in each security and terms of each security s structure 
the credit review included analysis of profitability  credit quality  operating efficiency  leverage  and liquidity using the most recently available financial and regulatory information for each underlying collateral issuer 
we also reviewed historical industry default data and current near term operating conditions 
using the results of our analysis  we estimated appropriate default and recovery probabilities for each piece of collateral and then estimated the expected cash flows for each security 
no recoveries were assumed on issuers who are in default 
the recovery assumptions on issuers who are deferring interest ranged from to with a cure assumed after the maximum deferral period 
as a result of this testing  we believe we will experience a loss of principal or interest on securities  and as such  recorded credit otti of million for one newly impaired and previously impaired pooled trust 
table of contents preferred securities in the fourth quarter 
in  million of total otti was recorded for impairment of the pooled trust preferred securities 
these otti adjustments negatively impacted our earnings 
please refer to the investment securities portfolio discussion and note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding otti 
certain other assets and liabilities which are not financial instruments also involve fair value measurements 
a description of these assets and liabilities  and the methodologies utilized to determine fair value are discussed below goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually  as of october  using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
goodwill impairment exists when a reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill is also tested for impairment on an interim basis  using the same two step process as the annual testing  if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
for  we performed interim evaluations of our goodwill balances at each quarter end  as well as our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of october during the first quarter  our stock price declined  from per common share at december   to per common share at march  many peer banks also experienced similar significant declines in market capitalization 
this decline primarily reflected the continuing economic slowdown and increased market concern surrounding financial institutions credit risks and capital positions  as well as uncertainty related to increased regulatory supervision and intervention 
we determined that these changes would more likely than not reduce the fair value of certain reporting units below their carrying amounts 
therefore  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the first quarter 
an independent third party was engaged to assist with the impairment assessment 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment includes developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables  incorporating general economic and market conditions  and selecting an appropriate control premium 
the selection and weighting of the various fair value techniques may result in a higher or lower fair value 
judgment is applied in determining the weightings that are most representative of fair value 
the assumptions used in the goodwill impairment assessment and the application of these estimates and assumptions are discussed below 
first quarter impairment testing the first step step of impairment testing requires a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to carrying value to identify potential impairment 
for our impairment testing conducted during the first quarter  we identified four reporting units regional banking  pfg  insurance  and auto finance and dealer services afds 
although insurance is included within pfg for business segment reporting  it was evaluated as a separate reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing because it has its own separately allocated goodwill resulting from prior acquisitions 
the fair value of pfg determined using the market approach as described below  excluding insurance  exceeded its carrying value  and goodwill was determined to not be impaired for this reporting unit 
there was no goodwill associated with afds and  therefore  it was not subject to impairment testing 
for regional banking  we utilized both the income and market approaches to determine fair value 
the income approach was based on discounted cash flows derived from assumptions of balance sheet and income statement activity 
an internal forecast was developed by considering several long term key business drivers such as anticipated loan and deposit growth 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value was estimated at 
the discount rate of was estimated based on the capital asset pricing model  
table of contents which considered the risk free interest rate year treasury bonds  market risk premium  equity risk premium  and a company specific risk factor 
the company specific risk factor was used to address the uncertainty of growth estimates and earnings projections of management 
for the market approach  revenue  earnings and market capitalization multiples of comparable public companies were selected and applied to the regional banking unit s applicable metrics such as book and tangible book values 
a control premium was used in the market approach 
the results of the income and market approaches were weighted and  respectively  to arrive at the final calculation of fair value 
as market capitalization declined across the banking industry  we believed that a heavier weighting on the income approach is more representative of a market participant s view 
for the insurance reporting unit  management utilized a market approach to determine fair value 
the aggregate fair market values were compared with market capitalization as an assessment of the appropriateness of the fair value measurements 
as our stock price fluctuated greatly  we used our average stock price for the days preceding the valuation date to determine market capitalization 
the aggregate fair market values of the reporting units compared with market capitalization indicated an implied premium of 
a control premium analysis indicated that the implied premium was within range of overall premiums observed in the market place 
neither the regional banking nor insurance reporting units passed step the second step step of impairment testing is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
to determine the implied fair value of goodwill  the fair value of regional banking and insurance as determined in step was allocated to all assets and liabilities of the reporting units including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets 
the allocation was done as if the reporting unit was acquired in a business combination  and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
this allocation process is only performed for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
the carrying values of recognized assets or liabilities other than goodwill  as appropriate were not adjusted nor were any new intangible assets recorded 
key valuations were the assessment of core deposit intangibles  the mark to fair value of outstanding debt and deposits  and mark to fair value on the loan portfolio 
core deposits were valued using a discount rate 
the marks on our outstanding debt and deposits were based upon observable trades or modeled prices using current yield curves and market spreads 
the valuation of the loan portfolio indicated discounts in the ranges of  depending upon the loan type 
the estimated fair value of these loan portfolios was based on an exit price  and the assumptions used were intended to approximate those that a market participant would have used in valuing the loans in an orderly transaction  including a market liquidity discount 
the significant market risk premium that is a consequence of the current distressed market conditions was a significant contributor to the valuation discounts associated with these loans 
we believed these discounts were consistent with transactions currently occurring in the marketplace 
upon completion of step  we determined that the regional banking and insurance reporting units goodwill carrying values exceeded their implied fair values of goodwill by  million and million  respectively 
as a result  we recorded a noncash pretax impairment charge of  million in the first quarter 
the impairment charge was included in noninterest expense and did not affect our regulatory and tangible capital ratios 
other interim and annual impairment testing while we recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter related to the sale of a small payments related business completed in july  we concluded that no other goodwill impairment was required during the remainder of subsequent to the first quarter impairment testing  we reorganized our regional banking segment to reflect how our assets and operations are now managed 
the regional banking business segment  which through march   had been managed geographically  is now managed by a product segment approach 

table of contents essentially  regional banking has been divided into the new segments of retail and business banking  commercial banking  and commercial real estate 
each of these three new segments is considered a separate reporting unit 
the remaining regional banking goodwill amount of million was reallocated on a relative fair value basis at the end of the first quarter to retail and business banking  commercial banking  and commercial real estate resulting in goodwill balances to those reporting units of million  million and respectively 
the step results of the annual impairment test indicated that the pfg and insurance units passed by a substantial margin 
the retail and business banking unit also passed  however  only by a minimal amount 
through analysis  we were confident that had the retail and business banking unit failed step at october   no additional goodwill impairment would have been recorded 
the assumptions and methodologies utilized in the annual assessment were consistent with those used in the first quarter assessment as discussed above 
overall  fair values for the reporting units improved significantly due to improvements in market comparables compared with the first quarter 
step was required for only the commercial banking reporting unit as it was determined in step that its carrying value exceeded its fair value 
upon completion of step  we determined that the commercial banking goodwill carrying value exceeded its implied fair value of goodwill  therefore  no goodwill impairment was recorded for this unit as of october the most significant step adjustment was the mark to fair value discount on the loan portfolio 
due to the current economic environment and other uncertainties  it is possible that our estimates and assumptions may adversely change in the future 
if our market capitalization decreases or the liquidity discount on our loan portfolio improves significantly without a concurrent increase in market capitalization  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment losses in future periods  whether in connection with our next annual impairment testing in the third quarter or prior to that  if any changes constitute a triggering event 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment loss would result  however  any such future impairment loss would be limited as the remaining goodwill balance was only billion at december  franklin loans restructuring transaction this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
franklin is a specialty consumer finance company primarily engaged in servicing performing  reperforming  and nonperforming residential mortgage loans 
prior to march   franklin owned a portfolio of loans secured by first and second liens on family residential properties 
these loans generally fell outside the underwriting standards of the federal national mortgage association fnma or fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or freddie mac  and involve elevated credit risk as a result of the nature or absence of income documentation  limited credit histories  higher levels of consumer debt  and or past credit difficulties nonprime loans 
at december   our total loans outstanding to franklin were million  all of which were placed on nonaccrual status 
additionally  the specific allowance for loan and lease losses for the franklin portfolio was million  resulting in our net exposure to franklin at december   of million 
on march   we entered into a transaction with franklin whereby a huntington wholly owned reit subsidiary reit indirectly acquired an ownership right in a trust which holds all the underlying consumer loans and other real estate owned oreo properties that were formerly collateral for the franklin commercial loans 
the equity interests provided to franklin by the reit were pledged by franklin as collateral for the franklin commercial loans 
as a result of the restructuring  on a consolidated basis  the million nonaccrual commercial loan to franklin at december   is no longer reported 
instead  we now report the loans secured by first and second mortgages on residential properties and oreo properties both of which had previously been assets of franklin or its subsidiaries and were pledged to secure our loan to franklin 
at the time of the 
table of contents restructuring  these loans had a fair value of million and the oreo properties had a fair value of million 
as a result  nals declined by a net amount of million as there were million commercial nals outstanding related to franklin  and million mortgage related nals outstanding  representing first and second lien mortgages that were nonaccruing at march  also  our specific allowance for loan and lease losses for the franklin portfolio of million was eliminated  however  no initial increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses alll relating to the acquired mortgages was recorded as these assets were recorded at fair value 
in accordance with asc  business combinations  we recorded a net deferred tax asset of million related to the difference between the tax basis and the book basis in the acquired assets 
because the acquisition price  represented by the equity interests in our wholly owned subsidiary  was equal to the fair value of the acquired ownership right  no goodwill was created from the transaction 
the recording of the net deferred tax asset was a bargain purchase under asc  and was recorded as a tax benefit in the first quarter 
pension pension plan assets consist of mutual funds and huntington common stock 
investments are accounted for at cost on the trade date and are reported at fair value 
mutual funds are valued at quoted net asset value nav 
huntington common stock is traded on a national securities exchange and is valued at the last reported sales price 
the discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to determine the benefit obligation and pension expense for december   are both assumptions 
any deviation from these assumptions could cause actual results to change 
other real estate owned oreo oreo property obtained in satisfaction of a loan is recorded at its estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs based upon the property s appraised value at the date of transfer  with any difference between the fair value of the property and the carrying value of the loan charged to the alll 
subsequent declines in value are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount  and are charged to noninterest expense 
gains or losses not previously recognized resulting from the sale of oreo are recognized in noninterest expense on the date of sale 
at december   oreo totaled million  representing a increase compared with million at december  income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes the calculation of our provision for federal income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments 
we have two accruals for income taxes our income tax receivable represents the estimated amount currently due from the federal government  net of any reserve for potential audit issues  and is reported as a component of accrued income and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet  our deferred federal income tax asset or liability represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap  and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under the federal tax code 
in the ordinary course of business  we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes 
the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws 
we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions 
in addition  we rely on various tax opinions  recent tax audits  and historical experience 
from time to time  we engage in business transactions that may have an effect on our tax liabilities 
where appropriate  we have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business transactions taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position 
however  changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can 
table of contents occur due to changes in tax rates  implementation of new business strategies  resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance 
such changes could affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to our financial position and or results of operations 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets at december   we had a net federal deferred tax asset of million  and a net state deferred tax asset of million 
based on our ability to offset the net deferred tax asset against taxable income in prior carryback years and the level of our forecast of future taxable income  there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at december  all available evidence  both positive and negative  was considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  impairment should be recognized 
however  our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change 
if our forecast of taxable income within the carryback carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets  such assets may be impaired 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting pronouncements adopted during and the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affect financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section of this md a and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions sky financial group  inc sky financial the merger with sky financial was completed on july  at the time of acquisition  sky financial had assets of billion  including billion of loans  and total deposits of billion 
the impact of this acquisition was included in our consolidated results for the last six months of additionally  in september  sky bank and sky trust  national association sky trust  merged into the bank and systems integration was completed 
as a result  performance comparisons between and are affected 
as a result of this acquisition  we have a significant loan relationship with franklin 
this relationship is discussed in greater detail in the commercial credit and critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates sections of this report 
unizan financial corp 
unizan the merger with unizan was completed on march  at the time of acquisition  unizan had assets of billion  including billion of loans and core deposits of billion 
the impact of this acquisition was included in our consolidated results for the last ten months of impact methodology for both the sky financial and unizan acquisitions  comparisons of the reported results are impacted as follows increased the absolute level of reported average balance sheet  revenue  expense  and the absolute level of certain credit quality results 
increased the absolute level of reported noninterest expense items because of costs incurred as part of merger integration activities  most notably employee retention bonuses  outside programming services related to systems conversions  occupancy expenses  and marketing expenses related to customer retention initiatives 

table of contents given the significant impact of the mergers on reported results  we believe that an understanding of the impacts of each merger is necessary to understand better underlying performance trends 
when comparing post merger period results to premerger periods  we use the following terms when discussing financial performance merger related refers to amounts and percentage changes representing the impact attributable to the merger 
merger costs represent noninterest expenses primarily associated with merger integration activities  including severance expense for key executive personnel 
nonmerger related refers to performance not attributable to the merger  and includes merger efficiencies  which represent noninterest expense reductions realized as a result of the merger 
after completion of our mergers  we combine the acquired companies operations with ours  and do not monitor the subsequent individual results of the acquired companies 
as a result  the following methodologies were implemented to estimate the approximate effect of the mergers used to determine merger related impacts 
balance sheet items sky financial for average loans and leases  as well as total average deposits  sky financial s balances as of june   adjusted for purchase accounting adjustments  and transfers of loans to loans held for sale  were used in the comparison 
to estimate the impact on average balances  it was assumed that the june   balances  as adjusted  remained constant over time 
unizan for average loans and leases  as well as core average deposits  balances as of the acquisition date were pro rated to the post merger period being used in the comparison 
for example  to estimate the impact on first quarter average balances  one third of the closing date balance was used as those balances were in reported results for only one month of the quarter 
quarterly estimated impacts for the second  third  and fourth quarter results were developed using this same pro rata methodology 
full year estimated results represent the annual average of each quarter s estimate 
this methodology assumed acquired balances remained constant over time 
income statement items sky financial sky financial s actual results for the first six months of  adjusted for the impact of unusual items and purchase accounting adjustments  were determined 
this six month adjusted amount was multiplied by two to estimate an annual impact 
this methodology does not adjust for any market related changes  or seasonal factors in sky financial s six month results 
nor does it consider any revenue or expense synergies realized since the merger date 
the one exception to this methodology of holding the estimated annual impact constant relates to the amortization of intangibles expense where the amount is known and is therefore used 
unizan unizan s actual full year results were used for pro rating the impact on post merger periods 
for example  to estimate the first quarter impact of the merger on personnel costs  one twelfth of unizan s full year personnel costs was used 
full quarter and year to date estimated impacts for subsequent periods were developed using this same pro rata methodology 
this results in an approximate impact since the methodology does not adjust for any unusual items or seasonal factors in unizan s reported results  or synergies realized since the merger date 
the one exception to this methodology relates to the amortization of intangibles expense where the amount is known and is therefore used 
certain tables and comments contained within our discussion and analysis provide detail of changes to reported results to quantify the estimated impact of the sky financial merger using this methodology

summary versus we reported a net loss of  million in  representing a loss per common share of 
these results compared unfavorably with a net loss of million  or per common share in comparisons with the prior year were significantly impacted by  million of goodwill impairment charges in  the issuance of million new shares of common stock  an increase of million in dividends on preferred shares  as well as other factors 
these factors  including the goodwill impairment  are discussed later in the significant items section 
was one of the most challenging years that we  and the entire banking industry  have faced  as we continued to be negatively impacted by the sustained economic weakness in our midwest markets 
the negative impacts were evident in several credit quality measures including increased nonaccrual loans nals  net charge offs ncos  and provision for credit losses 
although there have been recent signs that the economic environment is stabilizing  it remains uncertain 
ncos and provision levels increased substantially compared with the acl as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to at december   compared with at december  at the beginning of  a key objective was to better understand the risks in our credit portfolio in light of an economic outlook that showed increasing weakness 
the implementation of enhanced portfolio management processes followed by a series of detailed portfolio reviews throughout the year as the economic environment continued to weaken  permitted us to identify and proactively address the risks in our loan portfolio 
in late  because we believed there would still not be any significant economic recovery in  we reviewed our loan loss reserve assumptions 
as a result of that review  we substantially strengthened our loan loss reserves during the fourth quarter 
specifically  our fourth quarter provision for credit losses was of our total provision for credit losses of  million 
our provision for credit losses exceeded net charge offs  million by million 
going forward  we expect that the absolute level of the acl  and the related provision expense  will decline as existing reserves address the continuing losses inherent in our portfolio 
nals also significantly increased to  million  compared with  million at the prior year end  reflecting increased nals in our commercial real estate cre portfolios  particularly the single family home builder and retail properties segments 
commercial and industrial c i nals also increased significantly  particularly the segments related to businesses that support residential development 
in many cases  loans were placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan was less than days past due for both principal and interest payments  reflecting our proactive approach in identifying and classifying emerging problem credits 
while nals  as well as ncos  are expected to remain higher than historical levels during  we expect that the absolute levels will decline from levels 
there was a decline in 
table of contents nonperforming assets npas in the fourth quarter compared with the prior quarter  providing a basis of expectation for lower levels of npas and ncos in compared with at the beginning of  we viewed our highest risk loan portfolios to be franklin  as well as the single family home builder and retail properties segments of our cre portfolio 
during  we believe that we have substantially addressed the credit issues within our franklin portfolio and our single family home builder portfolio segment  and we do not expect any additional material credit impact to these portfolios 
however  the cre portfolio remains stressed  particularly the retail properties segment 
we continue to work with the borrowers in this segment to resolve the credit issues 
another key objective for was to strengthen our capital position in order to withstand potential future credit losses should the economic environment continue to deteriorate 
during  we raised billion of capital  including billion of common equity 
this increase in capital substantially strengthened all of our period end capital ratios compared with the year ago period 
our tangible to common equity tce ratio increased to from  and our tier common equity ratio increased to from 
our period end liquidity position strengthened compared with the end of as average core deposits grew billion  or  thus reducing our reliance on noncore funding 
additionally  we anticipate continued growth in core deposits for also  period end total cash and due from banks was billion  compared with billion at the end of  and our period end unpledged investment securities increased billion compared with the end of last year 
we redeployed a portion of the cash generated from our capital raising actions and our core deposit growth into our investment securities portfolio during the current year 
our preference would be to use this cash to generate higher margin loans  however  given the continued economic uncertainty  many of our customers  especially businesses  are waiting for further signs of economic recovery before borrowing funds 
fully taxable net interest income in declined million  or  compared with the decline primarily reflected a basis point decline in the net interest margin  as well as a billion  or  decline in average earning assets that reflected a billion  or  decline in total average loans 
we anticipate that the net interest margin will improve during  and we anticipate that loan growth will be flat  or increase slightly  in noninterest income in increased million  or  compared with this increase consisted of a million improvement in securities losses and a million improvement in msr valuation adjustments net of hedging 
after adjusting for these items  overall noninterest income performance was mixed for the year 
electronic banking income increased million  or  including additional third party processing fees  however  service charges on deposit accounts declined million  or  reflecting lower consumer nonsufficient funds and overdraft fees 
we expect that fee income in will be flat  or decrease slightly  compared with although we expect growth in trust services income  as well as brokerage and insurance revenue and capital market fees  that growth could be offset by declines in service charges on deposit accounts revenue related to lower nonsufficient funds and overdraft fees 
noninterest expense in increased  million compared with this increase consisted of goodwill impairment charges totaling  million  partially offset by additional gains of million related to the early extinguishment of debt 
after adjusting for these items  noninterest expense increased million 
primary contributors to the increase were a million increase in deposit and other insurance expense  and a million increase in oreo and foreclosure expense  representing higher levels of problem assets  as well as loss mitigation activities 
these increases were partially offset by an million  or  decline in personnel costs  reflecting a decline in salaries  and lower benefits and commission expense 
full time equivalent staff declined from the comparable year ago period 
for  expenses will remain well controlled  but are expected to increase  reflecting investments in growth  and the implementation of key strategic initiatives 

table of contents versus we reported a net loss of million in  representing a loss per common share of 
these results compared unfavorably with net income of million  or per common share  in comparisons with the prior year were significantly impacted by a number of factors that are discussed later in the significant items section 
during  the primary focus within our industry continued to be credit quality 
the economy deteriorated substantially throughout the year in our regions  and continued to put stress on our borrowers 
the largest setback to performance was the credit quality deterioration of the franklin relationship that occurred in the fourth quarter resulting in a negative impact of million  or per common share 
the loan restructuring associated with our relationship with franklin  completed during the fourth quarter  continued to perform consistent with the terms of the restructuring agreement through the third quarter 
however  cash flows that we received deteriorated significantly during the fourth quarter  reflecting a more severe than expected deterioration in the overall economy 
non franklin related ncos and provision levels in increased substantially compared with during  the non franklin related acl as a percentage of total loans and leases increased to compared with at the prior year end 
non franklin related nals also significantly increased to million  compared with million at the prior year end  reflecting increased nals in our cre loans  particularly the single family home builder and retail properties segments  and within our c i portfolio related to businesses that support residential development 
our year end regulatory capital levels were strong 
our tangible equity ratio improved basis points to compared with the prior year end  reflecting the benefits of a billion preferred stock issuance in the second quarter and a billion preferred stock issuance in the fourth quarter as a result of our participation in the troubled assets relief program tarp voluntary capital purchase plan 
however  our tangible common equity ratio declined basis points compared with the prior year end  and we believed that it was important that we begin rebuilding our common equity 
to that end  we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend to per common share  effective with the dividend declared on january  our period end liquidity position was sound  as we have conservatively managed our liquidity position at both the parent company and bank levels 
fully taxable net interest income in increased million  or  compared with the prior year reflected only six months of net interest income attributable to the acquisition of sky financial compared with twelve months for the sky financial acquisition added billion of loans and billion of deposits at july  there was good nonmerger related growth in total average commercial loans  partially offset by a decline in total average residential mortgages reflecting the continued slowdown in the housing market  as well as loan sales 
fully taxable net interest income in was negatively impacted by an basis point decline in the net interest margin compared with  primarily due to the interest accrual reversals resulting from loans being placed on nonaccrual status  as well as deposit pricing 
noninterest income in increased million  or  compared with comparisons with the prior year were affected by a million increase resulting from the sky financial acquisition  partially offset by the million net decline in msr valuation and hedging activity 
other factors contributing to the increase included the positive impact of loan sales  and the gain resulting from the proceeds of the visa initial public offering ipo in performance of the remaining components of noninterest income was generally favorable 
automobile operating lease income  brokerage and insurance income  and electronic banking income increased  however  trust services income declined reflecting the impact of lower market values on asset management revenues 
expenses were well controlled  with our efficiency ratio improving to in compared with in noninterest expense in increased million  or  compared with comparisons with the prior year were affected by million increase resulting from the sky financial acquisition  including the impact of restructuring and merger costs 
other factors contributing to the change in 
table of contents noninterest expense included positive impacts associated with the visa ipo  early extinguishment of debt  and litigation reserves 
performance of the remaining components of noninterest expense was mixed 
oreo and foreclosure expense  as well as professional services expense  increased as the economy continued to weaken 
automobile operating lease expense and deposit and other insurance expense also increased 
these increases are partially offset by a decline in personnel expense  as well as other expense categories  due to merger restructuring efficiencies 
significant items definition of significant items from time to time  revenue  expenses  or taxes  are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of ordinary banking activities and or by items that  while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities  are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or short term in nature 
we refer to such items as significant items 
most often  these significant items result from factors originating outside the company  eg  regulatory actions assessments  windfall gains  changes in accounting principles  one time tax assessments refunds  etc 
in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions out of the ordinary course of business  eg  merger restructuring charges  recapitalization actions  goodwill impairment  etc 
even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions  as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item 
for example  changes in the provision for credit losses  gains losses from investment activities  asset valuation writedowns  etc  reflect ordinary banking activities and are  therefore  typically excluded from consideration as a significant item 
we believe the disclosure of significant items in current and prior period results aids in better understanding our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items  if any  to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance  ie  within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations  as well as how  if at all  to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly 
to this end  we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg  earnings press releases  investor presentations  forms q and k 
significant items for any particular period are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance 
significant items influencing financial performance comparisons earnings comparisons among the three years ended december    and were impacted by a number of significant items summarized below 
goodwill impairment 
the impacts of goodwill impairment on our reported results were as follows during the first quarter  bank stock prices continued to decline significantly 
our stock price declined from per share at december  to per share at march  given this significant decline  we conducted an interim test for goodwill impairment 
as a result  we recorded a noncash  million per common share pretax charge 
see goodwill discussion located within the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section for additional information 
during the second quarter  a pretax goodwill impairment of million per common share was recorded relating to the sale of a small payments related business in july sky financial acquisition 
the merger with sky financial was completed on july  the impacts of sky financial on the reported results compared with the reported results are as follows increased the absolute level of reported average balance sheet  revenue  expense  and credit quality results eg  ncos 

table of contents increased reported noninterest expense items as a result of costs incurred as part of merger integration and post merger restructuring activities  most notably employee retention bonuses  outside programming services related to systems conversions  and marketing expenses related to customer retention initiatives 
these net merger costs were million per common share in and million per common share in franklin relationship 
our relationship with franklin was acquired in the sky financial acquisition 
on march   we restructured our relationship with franklin see critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section 
performance for included a nonrecurring net tax benefit of million per common share related to this restructuring 
also as a result of the restructuring  although earnings were not significantly impacted  commercial ncos increased million as the previously established million franklin specific alll was utilized to write down the acquired mortgages and oreo collateral to fair value 
early extinguishment of debt 
the positive impacts relating to the early extinguishment of debt on our reported results were million per common share in  million per common share in  and million per common share in these amounts were recorded to noninterest expense 
preferred stock conversion 
during the first and second quarters  we converted  and  shares  respectively  of series a non cumulative perpetual preferred series a preferred stock stock into common stock 
as part of these transactions  there was a deemed dividend that did not impact net income  but resulted in a negative impact of per common share for see capital discussion located within the risk management and capital section for additional information 
visa 
prior to the visa ipo occurring in march  visa was owned by its member banks  which included the bank 
in  we sold our investment in visa stock 
the impacts related to our visa stock ownership  and subsequent sale  for   and are presented in the following table table visa impacts earnings eps earnings eps earnings eps in millions gain related to sale of visa stock visa indemnification liability pretax 
recorded to noninterest income  and represented a gain on the sale of ownership interest in visa 
as part of the sale of our visa stock in  we released million  as of june   of the remaining indemnification liability 
concurrently  we established a swap liability associated with the conversion protection provided to the purchasers of the visa shares 
pretax 
recorded to noninterest expense  and represented our pro rata portion of an indemnification liability provided to visa by its member banks for various litigation filed against visa 
subsequently  in  an escrow account was established by visa using a portion of the proceeds received from the ipo 
this action resulted in a reversal of a portion of the liability as the escrow account reduced our potential exposure related to the indemnification 
other significant items influencing earnings performance comparisons

based upon the annual average outstanding diluted common shares 
after tax 
net interest income average balance sheet this section should be read in conjunction with significant items and our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest income from earning assets primarily loans  direct financing leases  and securities  and interest expense of funding sources primarily interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
earning asset balances and related funding  as well as changes in the levels of interest rates  impact net interest income 
the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities is the net interest spread 
noninterest bearing sources of funds  such as demand deposits and shareholders equity  also support earning assets 
the impact of the noninterest bearing sources of funds  often referred to as free funds  is captured in the net interest margin  which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets 
given the 
table of contents free nature of noninterest bearing sources of funds  the net interest margin is generally higher than the net interest spread 
both the net interest spread and net interest margin are presented on a fully taxable equivalent basis  which means that tax free interest income has been adjusted to a pretax equivalent income  assuming a tax rate 
the following table shows changes in fully taxable equivalent interest income  interest expense  and net interest income due to volume and rate variances for major categories of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

calculated assuming a tax rate 
versus fully taxable equivalent net interest income for decreased million  or  from this reflected the unfavorable impact of a billion  or  decrease in average earning assets  which included a billion decrease in average loans and leases 
also contributing to the decline in net interest income was a basis point decline in the fully taxable net interest margin to  primarily due to the unfavorable impact of our stronger liquidity position and an increase in nals

the decline in average cre loans reflected our planned efforts to shrink this portfolio through payoffs and paydowns  as well as the impact of charge offs and the reclassifications of cre loans to c i loans see commercial credit section 
the decline in average c i loans reflected paydowns  the franklin restructuring  and a reduction in the line of credit utilization in our automobile dealer floorplan exposure  partially offset by the reclassifications 
billion  or  decline in average automobile loans and leases due to the securitization of billion of automobile loans  as well as the continued runoff of the automobile lease portfolio 
billion  or  decline in residential mortgages reflecting the impact of loan sales  as well as the continued refinance of portfolio loans 
the majority of this refinance activity was fixed rate loans  which we typically sell in the secondary market 
partially offset by billion  or  increase in average home equity loans reflecting higher utilization of existing lines resulting from higher quality borrowers taking advantage of the current relatively lower interest rate environment  as well as a slowdown in runoff 
total average investment securities increased billion  or  as the cash proceeds from core deposit growth and the capital actions initiated during were deployed 
this increase was partially offset by a

table of contents the billion  or  nonmerger related increase in average total loans and leases primarily reflected billion  or  growth in average total commercial loans  with growth reflected in both the c i and cre portfolios 
the growth in cre loans was primarily to existing borrowers with a focus on traditional income producing property types and was not related to the single family home builder segment 
the growth in c i loans reflected a combination of draws associated with existing commitments  new loans to existing borrowers  and some originations to new high quality borrowers 
partially offset by billion  or  decline in total average consumer loans reflecting a billion  or  decline in residential mortgages due to loan sales  as well as the continued slowdown in the housing markets 
this decrease was partially offset by a billion  or  increase in average automobile loans and leases reflecting higher automobile loan originations  although automobile loan origination volumes have declined throughout due to the industry wide decline in sales 
automobile lease origination volumes have also declined throughout during the fourth quarter  we exited the automobile leasing business 
average other earning assets increased billion  primarily reflecting the increase in average trading account securities 
the increase in these assets reflected a change in our strategy to use trading account securities to hedge the change in fair value of our msrs  however  the practice of hedging the change in fair value of our msrs using on balance sheet trading assets ceased at the end of the billion  or  increase in average total deposits reflected growth in other deposits 
these deposits were primarily other domestic time deposits of  or more reflecting increases in commercial and public fund deposits

during  the internal revenue service irs completed the audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns for tax years and in  the irs began the audit of our consolidated federal income tax returns for tax years and in addition  we are subject to ongoing tax examinations in various state and local jurisdictions 
both the irs and state tax officials have proposed adjustments to our previously filed tax returns 
we believe that our tax positions related to such proposed adjustments are correct and supported by applicable statutes  regulations  and judicial authority  and intend to vigorously defend them 
it is possible that the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments  if unfavorable  may be material to the results of operations in the period it occurs 
however  although no assurance can be given  we believe that the resolution of these examinations will not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position 

table of contents risk management and capital risk identification and monitoring are key elements in overall risk management 
we believe our primary risk exposures are credit  market  liquidity  and operational risk 
credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the borrower s ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity prices 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future obligations resulting from external macro market issues  investor perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to the company such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
operational risk arises from the inherent day to day operations of the company that could result in losses due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  and external events 
we follow a formal policy to identify  measure  and document the key risks facing the company 
the policy outlines how those identified risks can be controlled or mitigated and how we monitor the controls to ensure that they are effective 
our chief risk officer is responsible for ensuring that appropriate systems of controls are in place for managing and monitoring risk across the company 
potential risk concerns are shared with the board of directors  as appropriate 
our internal audit department performs ongoing independent reviews of the risk management process and ensures the adequacy of documentation 
the results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control credit  market  liquidity  and operational risks are described in the following paragraphs 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to our counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
we are subject to credit risk in our lending  trading  and investment activities 
the nature and degree of credit risk is a function of the types of transactions  the structure of those transactions  and the parties involved 
the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities  as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending 
we also have credit risk associated with our investment and derivatives activities 
credit risk is incidental to trading activities and represents a significant risk that is associated with our investment securities portfolio see investment securities portfolio discussion 
credit risk is mitigated through a combination of credit policies and processes  market risk management activities  and portfolio diversification 
the maximum level of credit exposure to individual commercial borrowers is limited by policy guidelines based on each borrower or related group of borrowers 
all authority to grant commitments is delegated through the independent credit administration function and is monitored and regularly updated 
concentration risk is managed via limits on loan type  geography  industry  and loan quality factors 
we continue to focus predominantly on extending credit to retail and commercial customers with existing or expandable relationships within our primary banking markets 
we continue to add new borrowers that meet our targeted risk and profitability profile 
the checks and balances in the credit process and the independence of the credit administration and risk management functions are designed to appropriately assess the level of credit risk being accepted  facilitate the early recognition of credit problems when they do occur  and to provide for effective problem asset management and resolution 
credit exposure mix as shown in the following table  at december   commercial loans totaled billion  and represented of our total credit exposure 
our commercial loan portfolio is diversified along product type  
table of contents size  and geography within our footprint  and is comprised of the following see commercial credit discussion commercial and industrial c i loans c i loans represent loans to commercial customers for use in normal business operations to finance working capital needs  equipment purchases  or other projects 
the vast majority of these borrowers are commercial customers doing business within our geographic regions 
c i loans are generally underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners 
the financing of owner occupied facilities is considered a c i loan even though there is improved real estate as collateral 
this treatment is a function of the underwriting process  which focuses on cash flow from operations to repay the debt 
the sale of the real estate is not considered either a primary or secondary repayment source for the loan 
commercial real estate cre loans cre loans consist of loans for income producing real estate properties and real estate developers 
we mitigate our risk on these loans by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount and underwriting the loan with cash flow substantially in excess of the debt service requirement 
these loans are made to finance properties such as apartment buildings  office and industrial buildings  and retail shopping centers  and are repaid through cash flows related to the operation  sale  or refinance of the property 
construction cre loans construction cre loans are loans to individuals  companies  or developers used for the construction of a commercial or residential property for which repayment will be generated by the sale or permanent financing of the property 
our construction cre portfolio primarily consists of retail  residential land  single family  condominiums  office  and warehouse product types 
generally  these loans are for construction projects that have been presold  preleased  or otherwise have secured permanent financing  as well as loans to real estate companies that have significant equity invested in each project 
these loans are generally underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate group that actively monitors the construction phase and manages the loan disbursements according to the predetermined construction schedule 
total consumer loans were billion at december   and represented of our total credit exposure 
the consumer portfolio was diversified among home equity loans  residential mortgages  and automobile loans and leases see consumer credit discussion 
home equity home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
real estate market values as of the time the loan or line is granted directly affect the amount of credit extended and  in addition  changes in these values impact the severity of losses 
residential mortgages residential mortgage loans represent loans to consumers for the purchase or refinance of a residence 
these loans are generally financed over a to year term  and in most cases  are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence 
in some cases  government agencies or private mortgage insurers guarantee the loan 
generally speaking  our practice is to sell a significant majority of our fixed rate originations in the secondary market 
automobile loans leases automobile loans leases is primarily comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships  and includes exposure in several out of market states 
however  no out of market state represented more than of our total automobile loan and lease portfolio  and we expect to see relatively rapid reductions in these exposures as we ceased automobile loan originations in out of market states during the first quarter 
our automobile lease portfolio will continue to decline as we exited the automobile leasing business during the fourth quarter

commercial credit commercial loan portfolio reviews and actions in the first quarter  we restructured our commercial loan relationship with franklin by taking control of the underlying mortgage loan collateral  and transferring the exposure to the consumer loan portfolio as first and second lien loans to individuals secured by residential real estate properties 
see franklin loans restructuring transaction located within the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section 
we also proactively completed a concentrated review of our single family home builder and retail cre loan portfolio segments  our cre portfolio s two highest risk segments 
we initiated a review of the criticized portion of these portfolios on a monthly basis 
the increased review activity resulted in more pro active decisions on nonaccrual status  reserve levels  and charge offs throughout the remainder of this heightened level of portfolio monitoring is ongoing 
during the second quarter  we updated our evaluation of every noncriticized commercial relationship with an aggregate exposure of over  this review included c i  cre  and business banking loans and encompassed billion of total commercial loans  and billion in related 
table of contents commitments 
this was a detailed  labor intensive process designed to enhance our understanding of each borrower s financial position  and to ensure that this understanding was accurately reflected in our internal risk rating system 
our objective was to identify current and potential credit risks across the portfolio consistent with our expectation that the economy in our markets will not improve for the foreseeable future 
our activity in the third quarter represented a continuation of the portfolio management processes established in the first two quarters of we continue to fully assess our criticized loans over  on a monthly basis  and have maintained the discipline associated with the ongoing noncriticized review process established in the second quarter 
in many cases  we directly contacted the borrower and obtained the most recent financial information available  including interim financial results 
in addition  we discussed the impact of the economic environment on the future direction of their company  industry prospects  collateral values  and other borrower specific information 
in the fourth quarter  we finalized an initiative to segregate our cre portfolio into core and noncore components 
this distinction is based on borrower characteristics  relationship profitability  and location of the projects 
those designated as core relationships will be supported and grown in the coming years 
those borrowers designated as noncore will be managed effectively  with a goal of significantly reducing the exposure 
opportunities to expand some of these noncore relationships to a level of profitability may arise  resulting in a reclassification to a core designation 
additional information regarding the designation can be found in the core and noncore portfolios section located within the commercial real estate section 
also  during the fourth quarter  we conducted a review of our acl practices and methodologies 
we experienced increasing charge offs throughout  and continued to see increases in criticized and classified loans  although increases in the second half of were at a slower rate compared with the first half of the level of criticized loans  one indicator of possible future losses  reached its highest point in the fourth quarter 
even though there were declines in both the inflow and absolute level of nals  the inflow of million remained significant 
based on these asset quality trends  along with the unstable and fragile economy particularly in our midwest markets  as well as continued elevated quarterly charge offs  the acl was substantially increased 
much of our concern relates to our cre portfolio and  to a lesser degree  our c i portfolio 
regarding our cre portfolio  higher vacancy rates  lower rents  and falling property values are of significant concern 
loss in the event of default on many classes of cre properties has increased substantially throughout and is expected to continue into c i borrowers have been suffering from the weak economy for several consecutive years  and many borrowers no longer have sufficient capital to withstand protracted stress and  as a result  may not be able to comply with the original terms of their credit agreements 
lastly  with respect to our commercial loan exposure to automobile dealers  we have had an ongoing review process in place for some time now 
our automobile dealer commercial loan portfolio is predominantly comprised of larger  well capitalized  multi franchised dealer groups underwritten to conservative credit standards 
these dealer groups have largely remained profitable on a consolidated basis due to franchise diversity and a shift of sales emphasis to higher margin  used vehicles  as well as a focus on the service department 
additionally  our portfolio is closely monitored through receipt and review of monthly dealer financial statements and ongoing floor plan inventory audits  which allow for rapid response to weakening trends 
as a result  we have not experienced any significant deterioration in the credit quality of our automobile dealer commercial loan portfolio and remain comfortable with our expectation of no material losses  even given the substantial stress associated with our dealership closings announced by chrysler and general motors 
the more recent announcement regarding the saturn dealerships also has had no impact on our view of the portfolio 
see automobile industry section located within the commercial and industrial portfolio section for additional information 
in summary  we have established an ongoing portfolio management process involving each business segment  providing an improved view of emerging risk issues at a borrower level  enhanced ongoing monitoring capabilities  and strengthened actions and timeliness to mitigate emerging loan risks 
given our stated view of continued economic weakness for the foreseeable future  we anticipate some level of additional negative credit migration 
while we can give no assurances given market uncertainties  we believe that as a 
table of contents result of our increased portfolio management actions  a portfolio management process involving each business segment  an improved view of emerging risk issues at the borrower level  enhanced ongoing monitoring capabilities  and strengthened borrower level loan structures  any future migration will be manageable 
our commercial loan portfolio is diversified by c i and cre loans as shown in the following table table commercial industrial and commercial real estate loan and lease detail at december  in millions commercial and industrial loans franklin dealer floor plan loans equipment direct financing leases commercial and industrial loans and leases commercial real estate loans total commercial loans and leases the primary factors considered in commercial credit approvals are the financial strength of the borrower  assessment of the borrower s management capabilities  industry sector trends  type of exposure  transaction structure  and the general economic outlook 
while these are the primary factors considered  there are a number of other factors that may be considered in the decision process 
there are two processes for approving credit risk exposures 
the first  and more prevalent approach  involves individual approval of exposures 
credit officers that understand each local region and are experienced in the industries and loan structures of the requested credit exposure  make credit extension decisions 
all credit exposures greater than million are approved by a senior loan committee  led by our chief credit officer 
the second involves a centralized loan approval process for the standard products and structures utilized in small business banking 
in this centralized decision environment  where the above primary factors are the basis for approval  certain individuals who understand each local region make credit extension decisions to preserve our local decision making focus 
in addition to disciplined  consistent  and judgmental factors  a sophisticated credit scoring process is used as a primary evaluation tool in the determination of approving an exposure 
in commercial lending  ongoing credit management is dependent on the type and nature of the loan 
we monitor all significant exposures on a periodic basis 
all commercial credit extensions are assigned internal risk ratings reflecting the borrower s probability of default and loss given default 
this two dimensional rating methodology  which results in individual loan grades  provides granularity in the portfolio management process 
the probability of default is rated on a scale of and is applied at the borrower level 
the loss given default is rated on a scale and is applied based on the type of credit extension and the underlying collateral 
the internal risk ratings are assessed and updated with each periodic monitoring event 
there is also extensive macro portfolio management analysis on an ongoing basis 
the single family home builder portfolio and retail projects are examples of segments of the portfolio that have received more frequent evaluation at the loan level as a result of the economic environment and performance trends see single family home builder and retail properties discussions 
we continually review and adjust our risk rating criteria based on actual experience 
the continuous analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our commercial loan portfolio 
in addition to the initial credit analysis initiated during the approval process  the credit review group performs analyses to provide an independent review and assessment of the quality and or exposure of the loan 
this group is part of our risk management area  and reviews individual loans and credit processes and conducts a portfolio review for each of the regions on a month cycle 
the loan review group validates the internal risk ratings on approximately of the portfolio exposure each calendar year 
similarly  to provide consistent oversight  a centralized portfolio management team monitors and reports on the performance of the small business banking loans 

table of contents credit exposures may be designated as monitored credits when warranted by individual borrower performance  or by industry and environmental factors 
monitored credits are subjected to additional monthly reviews in order to adequately assess the borrower s credit status and to take appropriate action 
the special assets division sad is a specialized credit group that handles workouts  commercial recoveries  and problem loan sales 
this group is involved in the day to day management of relationships rated substandard or lower 
its responsibilities include developing an action plan  assessing the risk rating  and determining the adequacy of the reserve  the accrual status  and the ultimate collectibility of the managed monitored credits 
our commercial loan portfolio  including cre loans  is diversified by customer size  as well as throughout our geographic footprint 
certain segments of our commercial loan portfolio are discussed in further detail below commercial real estate cre portfolio as shown in the following table  cre loans totaled billion and represented of our total loan exposure at december  table commercial real estate loans by property type and property location at december  west total ohio michigan pennsylvania indiana kentucky florida virginia other amount in millions retail properties multi family office industrial and warehouse single family home builders lines to real estate companies hotel health care raw land and other land uses other total of total portfolio net charge offs net charge offs annualized nonaccrual loans of portfolio

our origination policies for this portfolio include loan product type specific policies such as ltv  debt service coverage ratios  and pre leasing requirements  as applicable 
generally  we a limit our loans to of the appraised value of the commercial real estate  b require net operating cash flows to be of required interest and principal payments  and c if the commercial real estate is non owner occupied  require that at least of the space of the project be pre leased 
we may require more conservative loan terms  depending on the project 
dedicated real estate professionals within our commercial real estate segment team originated the majority of the portfolio  with the remainder obtained from prior acquisitions 
appraisals from approved vendors are reviewed by an internal appraisal review group to ensure the quality of the valuation used in the underwriting process 
the portfolio is diversified by project type and loan size  and represents a significant piece of the credit risk management strategies employed for this portfolio 
our loan review staff provides an assessment of the quality of the underwriting and structure and validates the risk rating assigned to the loan 
appraisal values are obtained in conjunction with all originations and renewals  and on an as needed basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
given the stressed environment for some loan types  we have initiated ongoing portfolio level reviews of segments such as single family home builders and retail properties see single family home builders and retail properties discussions 
these reviews generate action plans based on occupancy levels or sales volume associated with the projects being reviewed 
the results of these actions indicated that additional stress is likely due to the current economic conditions 
property values are updated using appraisals on a regular basis to ensure that appropriate decisions regarding the ongoing management of the portfolio reflect the changing market conditions 
this highly individualized process requires working closely with all of our borrowers as well as an in depth knowledge of cre project lending and the market environment 
at the portfolio level  we actively monitor the concentrations and performance metrics of all loan types  with a focus on higher risk segments 
macro level stress test scenarios based on retail sales and home price depreciation trends for the segments are embedded in our performance expectations  and lease up and absorption scenarios are assessed 
we anticipate the current stress within this portfolio will continue for the foreseeable future  resulting in elevated charge offs  nals  and alll levels 

table of contents during  portfolio reviews resulted in reclassifications of certain cre loans to c i loans 
these net reclassifications totaled billion  and were primarily associated with a loans to businesses secured by the real estate and buildings that house their operations as these owner occupied loans secured by real estate were underwritten based on the cash flow of the business  and b healthcare entities and colleges and universities 
we believe that loans underwritten based on cash flow from operations should be considered as commercial loans secured by real estate  rather than the cre portfolio which is real estate project oriented 
within the cre portfolio  the single family home builder and retail properties segments continued to be stressed throughout as a result of the continued decline in the housing markets and general economic conditions 
as previously mentioned above  these segments were considered to be the highest risk segments in within our cre portfolio  and are discussed further below 
single family home builders at december  we had million of cre loans to single family home builders 
such loans represented of total loans and leases 
of this portfolio segment  were to finance projects currently under construction  to finance land under development  and to finance land held for development 
the million represented a million  or  decrease compared with  million at december  the decrease primarily reflected the reclassification of loans secured by family residential real estate rental properties to c i loans  consistent with industry practices in the definition of this segment 
other factors contributing to the decrease in exposure include no new originations in this portfolio segment in  increased property sale activity  and substantial charge offs 
the increased sale activity was evident throughout based on the portfolio management processes  including charge off activity  over the past months  we believe that we have substantially addressed the credit issues in this portfolio 
we do not expect any future significant credit impact from this portfolio segment 
retail properties our portfolio of cre loans secured by retail properties totaled  million  or approximately of total loans and leases  at december  loans within this portfolio segment declined million  or  from december  credit approval in this portfolio segment is generally dependent on pre leasing requirements  and net operating income from the project must cover debt service by specified percentages when the loan is fully funded 
the weakness of the economic environment in our geographic regions significantly impacted the projects that secure the loans in this portfolio segment 
lower occupancy rates  reduced rental rates  increased unemployment levels compared with recent years  and the expectation that these levels will continue to increase for the foreseeable future are expected to adversely affect our borrowers ability to repay these loans 
we have increased the level of credit risk management activity to this portfolio segment  and we analyze our retail property loans in detail by combining property type  geographic location  tenants  and other data  to assess and manage our credit concentration risks 
core and noncore portfolios each cre loan is classified as either core or noncore 
we segmented the cre portfolio into these designations in order to provide more clarity around our portfolio management strategies and to provide additional clarity for our investors 
a cre loan is generally considered core when the borrower is an experienced  well capitalized developer in our midwest footprint  and has either an established meaningful relationship or the prospective of establishing one  that generates an acceptable return on capital 
the core cre portfolio was billion at december   representing of total cre loans 
personal guarantees support approximately of this portfolio 
based on the extensive project level assessment process  including forward looking collateral valuations  we are comfortable with the credit quality of the core portfolio at this time 
a cre loan is generally considered noncore based on a lack of a substantive relationship outside of the credit product  with no immediate prospects for improvement 
the noncore cre portfolio totaled billion 
table of contents at december   representing of total cre loans 
personal guarantees support approximately of this portfolio  with over representing secured debt 
this segment has only approximately million of future funding requirements 
nevertheless  it is within the noncore segment where most of the credit quality challenges exist 
for example  million  or  of related outstandings  are classified as nals 
the special assets division sad administers billion  or  of total noncore cre loans 
it is expected that we will exit the majority of noncore cre relationships over time 
this would reflect normal repayments  possible sales should economically attractive opportunities arise  or the reclassification as a core cre relationship if it expands to meet the core requirements

we believe segregating the noncore cre from core cre improves our ability to understanding the nature  performance prospects  and problem resolution opportunities of this segment  thus allowing us to continue to deal proactively with future credit issues 
the combination of prior ncos and the existing acl represents the total credit actions taken on each segment of the portfolio 
from this data  we calculate a measurement  called a credit mark  that provides a consistent measurement of the cumulative credit actions taken against a specific portfolio segment 
we believe that the combined credit activity is appropriate for each of the cre segments 
commercial and industrial c i portfolio the c i portfolio is comprised of loans to businesses where the source of repayment is associated with the ongoing operations of the business 
generally  the loans are secured with the financing of the borrower s assets  such as equipment  accounts receivable  or inventory 
in many cases  the loans are secured by real estate  although the sale of the real estate is not a primary source of repayment for the loan 
for loans secured by real estate  appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination  and updated on an as needed basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements 
there were no outstanding commercial loans that would be considered a concentration of lending to a particular industry or within a geographic standpoint 
currently  higher risk segments of the c i portfolio include loans to borrowers supporting the home building industry  contractors  and automotive suppliers 
however  the combined total of these segments represent less than of the total c i portfolio 
we manage the risks inherent in this portfolio through origination policies  concentration limits  ongoing loan level reviews  recourse requirements  and continuous portfolio risk management activities 
our origination policies for this portfolio include loan product type specific policies such as loan to value ltv  and debt service coverage ratios  as applicable 
c i borrowers have been challenged by the weak economy for consecutive years  and some borrowers may no longer have sufficient capital to withstand the protracted stress and  as a result  may not be able to comply with the original terms of their credit agreements 
we continue to focus ongoing attention on the portfolio management process to proactively identify borrowers that may be facing financial difficulty 
to the extent c i loans are secured by real estate collateral  appropriate appraisals are obtained at origination  and updated on an as needed basis  in compliance with regulatory requirements

table of contents within the c i portfolio  the automotive industry segment continued to be stressed and is discussed below 
automotive industry the following table provides a summary of loans and total exposure including both loans and unused commitments and standby letters of credit to companies related to the automotive industry since december  the automobile industry supplier exposure is embedded primarily in our c i portfolio within the commercial banking segment  while the dealer exposure is originated and managed within the afds business segment 
table automotive industry exposure december  loans of total total loans of total total outstanding loans exposure outstanding loans exposure in millions suppliers domestic foreign total suppliers dealer floor plan domestic floor plan foreign other total dealer total automotive companies with of revenue derived from the automotive industry 
although we do not have direct exposure to the automobile manufacturing companies  we do have limited exposure to automobile industry suppliers  and automobile dealer related exposures 
while we continue to believe that this industry represents a high degree of risk  the primary impact to automobile industry suppliers has likely already occurred  given the substantial adjustments to production in and as a result of our geographic locations and the above referenced exposure  we have closely monitored the entire automobile industry  particularly the recent events associated with general motors and chrysler  including bankruptcy filings  plant closings  production suspension  and model eliminations 
we have anticipated the significant reductions in production across the industry that will result in additional economic distress in some of our markets 
our eastern michigan and northern ohio markets are particularly exposed to these reductions  although all our markets are affected 
we anticipate the impact will result in additional stress throughout our commercial and consumer loan portfolios  as secondary and tertiary businesses are affected by the actions of the manufacturers 
however  as these actions were anticipated  many of the potential impacts have been mitigated through changes in underwriting criteria and regionally focused policies and procedures 
within the afds portfolio  our dealer selection criteria and focus is on multiple brand dealership groups  as we have immaterial exposure to single brand dealerships 
as shown in the table above  at december   our total direct exposure to the automotive supplier segment was million  of which million represented loans outstanding 
we included companies that derive more than of their revenues from contracts with automobile manufacturing companies 
this low level of exposure is reflective of our industry level risk limits approach 
while the entire automotive industry is under significant pressure as evidenced by a significant reduction in new car sales and the resulting production declines  we believe that our floorplan exposure will not be

our floorplan exposure is centered in large  multi dealership entities  and we have focused on client selection and conservative underwriting standards 
we anticipate that the economic environment will affect our dealerships in the near term  but we believe the majority of our portfolio will perform favorably relative to the industry in the increasingly stressed environment 
the decline in floorplan loans outstanding at december   compared with december   reflected reduced dealership inventory  in part as a result of the successful cash for clunkers program 
while the specific impacts associated with the ongoing changes in the industry are unknown  we believe that we have taken appropriate steps to limit our exposure 
when we have chosen to extend credit  our client selection process has focused us on the most diversified and strongest dealership groups 
we do not anticipate any material dealer related losses in the portfolio despite numerous dealership closings during our dealer selection criteria  with a focus on multi dealership groups has proven itself in this environment 
franklin relationship this section should be read in conjunction with significant item and the franklin loans restructuring transaction discussion located within the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section 
as a result of the march   restructuring  on a consolidated basis  the million nonaccrual commercial loan to franklin at december   was no longer reported 
instead  we reported the loans secured by first and second mortgages on residential properties and oreo properties  both of which had previously been assets of franklin or its subsidiaries  and were pledged to secure our commercial loan to franklin 
at the time of the restructuring  the loans had a fair value of million and the oreo properties had a fair value of million 
as of december   the balances had reduced to million and million  respectively 
there is not a specific alll for the franklin portfolio

collection strategies were designed to generate cash flow with the intention of reducing our exposure associated with these loans 
consumer credit consumer credit approvals are based on  among other factors  the financial strength and payment history of the borrower  type of exposure  and the transaction structure 
consumer credit decisions are generally made in a centralized environment utilizing decision models 
however  certain individuals who understand each local region have the authority to make credit extension decisions to preserve our local decision making focus 
each credit extension is assigned a specific probability of default and loss given default 
the probability of default is generally based on the borrower s most recent credit bureau score fico  which we update quarterly  while the loss given default is related to the type of collateral and the ltv ratio associated with the credit extension 

table of contents in consumer lending  credit risk is managed from a loan type and vintage performance analysis 
all portfolio segments are continuously monitored for changes in delinquency trends and other asset quality indicators 
we make extensive use of portfolio assessment models to continuously monitor the quality of the portfolio  which may result in changes to future origination strategies 
the continuous analysis and review process results in a determination of an appropriate alll amount for our consumer loan portfolio 
the independent risk management group has a consumer process review component to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of the consumer credit processes 
collection action is initiated on an as needed basis through a centrally managed collection and recovery function 
the collection group employs a series of collection methodologies designed to maintain a high level of effectiveness while maximizing efficiency 
in addition to the retained consumer loan portfolio  the collection group is responsible for collection activity on all sold and securitized consumer loans and leases

the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are primarily located throughout our geographic footprint 
the general slowdown in the housing market has impacted the performance of our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios over the past year 
while the degree of price depreciation varies across our markets  all regions throughout our footprint have been affected 
given the continued economic weaknesses in our markets  the home equity and residential mortgage portfolios are particularly noteworthy  and are discussed in greater detail below table selected home equity and residential mortgage portfolio data home equity residential home equity loans lines of credit mortgages ending balance in millions portfolio weighted average ltv ratio portfolio weighted average fico year ended december  home home equity residential equity loans lines of credit mortgages originations in millions origination weighted average ltv ratio origination weighted average fico the loan to value ltv ratios for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are cumulative ltvs reflecting the balance of any senior loans 
portfolio weighted average fico reflects currently updated customer credit scores whereas origination weighted average fico reflects the customer credit scores at the time of loan origination 
home equity portfolio our home equity portfolio loans and lines of credit consists of both first and second mortgage loans with underwriting criteria based on minimum credit scores  debt to income ratios  and ltv ratios 
we offer closed end home equity loans with a fixed interest rate and level monthly payments and a variable rate  interest only home equity line of credit 
home equity loans are generally fixed rate with periodic principal and interest payments 
home equity lines of credit are generally variable rate and do not require payment of principal during the year revolving period of the line 
we believe we have granted credit conservatively within this portfolio 
we have not originated stated income home equity loans or lines of credit that allow negative amortization 
also  we have not originated home equity loans or lines of credit with an ltv ratio at origination greater than  except for infrequent situations with high quality borrowers 
however  recent declines in housing prices have likely eliminated a 
table of contents portion of the collateral for this portfolio as some loans with an original ltv ratio of less than currently have an ltv ratio above 
at december   of our home equity loan portfolio  and of our home equity line of credit portfolio were secured by a first mortgage lien on the property 
the risk profile is substantially improved when we hold a first mortgage lien position 
in  over of our home equity portfolio originations both loans and lines of credit were loans where the loan was secured by a first mortgage lien 
for certain home equity loans and lines of credit  we may utilize automated valuation methodology avm or other model driven value estimates during the credit underwriting process 
regardless of the estimate methodology  we supplement our underwriting with a third party fraud detection system to limit our exposure to flipping  and outright fraudulent transactions 
we update values  as we believe appropriate  and in compliance with applicable regulations  for loans identified as higher risk  based on performance indicators to facilitate our workout and loss mitigation functions 
we continue to make appropriate origination policy adjustments based on our assessment of an appropriate risk profile as well as industry actions 
as an example  the significant changes made in and by fannie mae and freddie mac resulted in the reduction of our maximum ltv ratio on second mortgage loans  even for customers with high credit scores 
in addition to origination policy adjustments  we take appropriate actions  as necessary  to manage the risk profile of this portfolio 
we focus production primarily within our banking footprint or to existing customers 
residential mortgages we focus on higher quality borrowers  and underwrite all applications centrally  often through the use of an automated underwriting system 
we do not originate residential mortgage loans that allow negative amortization or are payment option adjustable rate mortgages 
all residential mortgage loans are originated based on a full appraisal during the credit underwriting process 
additionally  we supplement our underwriting with a third party fraud detection system to limit our exposure to flipping  and outright fraudulent transactions 
we update values  as we believe appropriate  and in compliance with applicable regulations  for loans identified as higher risk  based on performance indicators to facilitate our workout and loss mitigation functions 
during  we sold million of underperforming mortgage loans  resulting in a reduction in residential mortgage nals 
we will continue to evaluate this type of transaction in future periods based on market conditions 
a majority of the loans in our loan portfolio have adjustable rates 
our adjustable rate mortgages arms are primarily residential mortgages that have a fixed rate for the first to years and then adjust annually 
these loans comprised approximately of our total residential mortgage loan portfolio at december  at december   arm loans that were expected to have rates reset totaled million for  and million for given the quality of our borrowers and the relatively low current interest rates  we believe that we have a relatively limited exposure to arm reset risk 
nonetheless  we have taken actions to mitigate our risk exposure 
we initiate borrower contact at least six months prior to the interest rate resetting  and have been successful in converting many arms to fixed rate loans through this process 
additionally  where borrowers are experiencing payment difficulties  loans may be reunderwritten based on the borrower s ability to repay the loan 
we had million of alt a mortgage loans in the residential mortgage loan portfolio at december   compared with million at december  these loans have a higher risk profile than the rest of the portfolio as a result of origination policies for this limited segment including reliance on stated income  stated assets  or higher acceptable ltv ratios

our exposure related to this product will continue to decline in the future as we stopped originating these loans in interest only loans comprised million of residential real estate loans at december   compared with million at december  interest only loans are underwritten to specific standards including minimum credit scores  stressed debt to income ratios  and extensive collateral evaluation

several recent government actions have been enacted that have affected the residential mortgage portfolio and msrs in particular 
various refinance programs positively affected the availability of credit for the industry 
we are utilizing these programs to enhance our existing strategies of working closely with our customers 
automotive industry impacts on consumer loan portfolio the issues affecting the automotive industry see automotive industry discussion located within the commercial credit section also have an impact on the performance of the consumer loan portfolio 
while there is a direct correlation between the industry situation and our exposure to the automotive suppliers and automobile dealers in our commercial portfolio  the loss of jobs and reduction in wages may have a negative impact on our consumer portfolio 
we continue to monitor the potential impact on our geographic regions in the event of significant production changes or plant closings in our markets and  we believe that we have made a number of positive decisions regarding the quality of our consumer portfolio given the current environment 
in the indirect automobile portfolio  we have consistently focused on borrowers with high credit scores and lower ltvs  as reflected by the performance of the portfolio given the economic conditions 
in the residential and home equity loan portfolios  we have been operating in a relatively high unemployment situation for an extended period of time  yet have been able to maintain our performance metrics reflecting our focus on strong underwriting 
in summary  while we anticipate our performance results may be negatively impacted  we believe the impact will be manageable 
counterparty risk in the normal course of business  we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing  asset and liability management  mortgage banking  and for trading activities 
as a result  we are exposed to credit risk  or the risk of loss if the counterparty fails to perform according to the terms of our contract or agreement 
we minimize counterparty risk through credit approvals  actively setting adjusting exposure limits  implementing monitoring procedures similar to those used for our commercial portfolio see commercial credit discussion  generally entering into transactions only with counterparties that carry high quality ratings  and requiring collateral when appropriate 
the majority of the financial institutions with whom we are exposed to counterparty risk are large commercial banks 
the potential amount of loss  which would have been recognized at december   if a counterparty defaulted  did not exceed million for any individual counterparty 

table of contents credit quality we believe the most meaningful way to assess overall credit quality performance for is through an analysis of credit quality performance ratios 
this approach forms the basis of most of the discussion in the three sections immediately following nals and npas  acl  and ncos 
credit quality performance in was negatively impacted by the sustained economic weakness in our midwest markets  although there were signs of stabilization late in the year 
in addition  we initiated certain actions in with regard to loss recognition on our residential mortgage portfolio that we believe will increase the flexibility in working the loans toward a more timely resolution 
we anticipate a challenging full year in with regards to credit quality  but believe that was the peak in terms of npa levels  as well as for credit losses and the related increase in the acl 
nonaccrual loans nals and nonperforming assets npas this section should be read in conjunction with significant items and and the franklin loans restructuring transaction discussion located with the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section 
npas consist of a nals  which represent loans and leases that are no longer accruing interest  b impaired held for sale loans  c oreo  and d other npas 
a c i or cre loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the loan is days past due 
residential mortgage loans are placed on nonaccrual status at days  and a charge off is recorded when the loan has been foreclosed and the loan balance exceeds the fair value of the collateral 
a home equity loan is placed on nonaccrual status at days  and a charge off is recorded when it is determined that there is not sufficient equity in the loan to cover our position 
when interest accruals are suspended  accrued interest income is reversed with current year accruals charged to earnings and prior year amounts generally charged off as a credit loss 
accruing restructured loans arls consists of accruing loans that have been reunderwritten  modified  or restructured when borrowers are experiencing payment difficulties 
generally  prior to restructuring  these loans have not reached a status to be considered as nals 
these loan restructurings are one component of the loss mitigation process  and are made to increase the likelihood of the borrower s ability to repay the loan

this reflected a net increase of million related to the first quarter franklin restructuring  partially offset by declines due to the more conservative position regarding the timing of loss recognition  active loss mitigation  as well as the sale of residential mortgage nals during our efforts to proactively address existing issues with loss mitigation and loan modification transactions have helped to reduce the inflow of new residential mortgage nals

allowances for credit losses acl this section should be read in conjunction with significant item  critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain two reserves  both of which are available to absorb credit losses the alll and the aulc 
when summed together  these reserves comprise the total acl 
our credit administration group is responsible for developing methodology assumptions and estimates  as well as determining the adequacy of the acl 
the alll represents the estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
additions to the alll result from recording provision expense for loan losses or recoveries  while reductions reflect charge offs  net of recoveries  or the sale of loans 
the aulc is determined by applying the transaction reserve process  which is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  to the unfunded portion of the portfolio adjusted by an applicable funding expectation 
as shown in the following tables below  the alll increased to  million at december   compared with million at december  expressed as a percent of period end loans and leases  the alll ratio increased to at december   compared with at december  the million increase in the alll primarily reflected an increase in specific reserves associated with impaired loans  and an increase associated with risk grade migration  predominantly in the commercial portfolio 
the increase is also a result of a change in estimate resulting from the fourth quarter review of our acl practices and assumptions  consisting of approximately million increase in the judgmental component

we believe that the total acl nal coverage ratio of at december   represented an appropriate level of reserves for the remaining risk in the portfolio 
the franklin nal balance of million does not have reserves assigned as those loans were written down to fair value as a part of the restructuring agreement on march   and we do not expect any significant additional charge offs

non franklin related commercial ncos in were  million and million in the non franklin related increase of million in c i ncos reflected the continued economic weakness in our regions and our focused proactive approach to loss recognition in the increase was spread across our footprint  with no industry concentrations that were inconsistent with our industry exposure levels 

table of contents the million increase in cre ncos was primarily centered in the single family home builder and the retail portfolios 
these two segments of the cre portfolio were the primary drivers of the overall portfolio performance in the impact was spread across our footprint  and included significant charge offs associated with our relatively small out of market portfolio 
we continued our ongoing portfolio management efforts  including obtaining updated appraisals on properties and assessing a project status within the context of market environment expectations 
historically  the single family homebuilder portfolio and retail portfolios have been the highest risk segments 
based on our portfolio management processes  including charge off activity over the past two and one half years  we believe the credit issues in the single family homebuilder portfolio have been addressed 
the retail property portfolio remains more susceptible to the ongoing market disruption  but we also believe that the combination of prior charge offs and existing reserve balances positions us well to make effective credit decisions in the future 
in assessing commercial ncos trends  it is helpful to understand the process of how these loans are treated as they deteriorate over time 
reserves for loans are established at origination consistent with the level of risk associated with the original underwriting 
if the quality of a commercial loan deteriorates  it migrates to a lower quality risk rating as a result of our normal portfolio management process  and a higher reserve amount is assigned 
as a part of our normal portfolio management process  the loan is reviewed and reserves are increased as warranted 
charge offs  if necessary  are generally recognized in a period after the reserves were established 
if the previously established reserves exceed that needed to satisfactorily resolve the problem credit  a reduction in the overall level of the reserve could be recognized 
in summary  if loan quality deteriorates  the typical credit sequence for commercial loans are periods of reserve building  followed by periods of higher ncos as previously established reserves are utilized 
additionally  it is helpful to understand that increases in reserves either precede or are in conjunction with increases in nals 
when a credit is classified as nal  it is evaluated for specific reserves or charge off 
as a result  an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in reserves or an expectation of higher future ncos 
total consumer ncos during were million  or an annualized  compared with million  or an annualized  in the increases were spread across all consumer loan portfolios  but particularly in the residential mortgage portfolio 
automobile loan and lease ncos in increased million  or  compared with the performance of the portfolio relative to ncos reflected the positive impact of increasing used vehicle prices  offset by the continued economic weakness in our markets 
performance of this portfolio on both an absolute and relative basis continued to be consistent with our views regarding the underlying quality of the portfolio 
the level of delinquencies have improved compared with levels  further supporting our view of flat to improved performance going forward 
the nco performance of our home equity portfolio continued to be impacted by lower housing prices  and the general weak market conditions 
while ncos were higher compared with prior years  there continued to be a declining trend throughout in the early stage delinquency level in the home equity line of credit portfolio  supporting our longer term positive view for home equity portfolio performance 
also contributing to the nco performance of our home equity portfolio was a significant increase in loss mitigation activity and short sales 
we continue to believe that our more proactive loss mitigation strategies are in our best interest  as well as that of our customers 
although ncos have increased over the course of  given the market conditions  performance remained within expectations 
the increase in our residential mortgage ncos compared with the prior year  reflected the continued negative impacts resulting from the general weak economic conditions and housing related pressures 
the increased ncos were a direct result of our continued emphasis on loss mitigation strategies  an increased number of short sales  and a more conservative position regarding the timing of loss recognition 
specifically  in  we sold million of underperforming loans that resulted in million of ncos  and we adjusted the timing of loss recognition that resulted in an additional million of ncos 
we continued to see some positive trends in early stage delinquencies  indicating that even with the economic stress on our borrowers  losses are expected to remain manageable 

table of contents investment securities portfolio this section should be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates discussion  and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we routinely review our investment securities portfolio  and recognize impairment write downs based primarily on fair value  issuer specific factors and results  and our intent to hold such investments 
our investment securities portfolio is evaluated in light of established asset liability management objectives  and changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio  as well as the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed

declines in the fair value of available for sale investment securities are recorded as temporary impairment  noncredit otti  or credit otti adjustments 
temporary impairment adjustments are recorded when the fair value of a security fluctuates from its historical cost 
temporary impairment adjustments are recorded in accumulated oci  and therefore  reduces equity 
temporary impairment adjustments do not impact net income or risk based capital 
a recovery of available for sale security prices also is recorded as an adjustment to oci for securities that are temporarily impaired  and results in an increase to equity 
because the available for sale securities portfolio is recorded at fair value  the conclusion as to whether an investment decline is other than temporarily impaired  does not significantly impact our equity position as the amount of temporary adjustment has already been reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
a recovery in the value of an other than temporarily impaired security is recorded as additional interest income over the remaining life of the security 
given the continued disruption in the financial markets  we may be required to recognize additional credit otti losses in future periods with respect to our available for sale investment securities portfolio 
the amount and timing of any additional credit otti will depend on the decline in the underlying cash flows of the securities 
if our intent regarding the decision to hold temporarily impaired securities changes in future periods  we may be required to record noncredit otti  which will negatively impact our earnings 
alt a  pooled trust preferred  and private label cmo securities our three highest risk segments of our investment portfolio are the alt a mortgage backed  pooled trust preferred  and private label cmo portfolios 
the alt a mortgage backed securities and pooled trust preferred securities are located within the asset backed securities portfolio 
the performance of the underlying securities in each of these segments continues to reflect the economic environment 
each of these securities in these three segments is subjected to a rigorous review of their projected cash flows 
these reviews are supported with analysis from independent third parties 
see the investment securities section located within the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section for additional information

negative changes to the above credit ratings would generally result in an increase of our risk weighted assets  which could result in a reduction to our regulatory capital ratios

market risk market risk represents the risk of loss due to changes in market values of assets and liabilities 
we incur market risk in the normal course of business through exposures to market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  credit spreads  and expected lease residual values 
we have identified two primary sources of market risk interest rate risk and price risk 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk 

table of contents interest rate risk overview interest rate risk is the risk to earnings and value arising from changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from timing differences in the repricings and maturities of interest bearing assets and liabilities reprice risk  changes in the expected maturities of assets and liabilities arising from embedded options  such as borrowers ability to prepay residential mortgage loans at any time and depositors ability to terminate certificates of deposit before maturity option risk  changes in the shape of the yield curve whereby interest rates increase or decrease in a non parallel fashion yield curve risk  and changes in spread relationships between different yield curves  such as us treasuries and london interbank offered rate libor basis risk 
our board of directors establishes broad policy limits with respect to interest rate risk 
our market risk committee mrc  formerly the management risk committee  establishes specific operating guidelines within the parameters of the board of directors policies 
in general  we seek to minimize the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and the economic values of assets and liabilities 
our mrc regularly monitors the level of interest rate risk sensitivity to ensure compliance with board of directors approved risk limits 
interest rate risk management is an active process that encompasses monitoring loan and deposit flows complemented by investment and funding activities 
effective management of interest rate risk begins with understanding the dynamic characteristics of assets and liabilities and determining the appropriate interest rate risk posture given business segment forecasts  management objectives  market expectations  and policy constraints 
asset sensitive position refers to an increase in short term interest rates that is expected to generate higher net interest income as rates earned on our interest earning assets would reprice upward more quickly than rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  liability sensitive position refers to an increase in short term interest rates that is expected to generate lower net interest income as rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities would reprice upward more quickly than rates earned on our interest earning assets 
income simulation and economic value analysis interest rate risk measurement is performed monthly 
two broad approaches to modeling interest rate risk are employed income simulation and economic value analysis 
an income simulation analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of forecasted net interest income to changes in market rates over a one year time period 
although bank owned life insurance  automobile operating lease assets  and excess cash balances held at the federal reserve bank are classified as noninterest earning assets  and the net revenue from these assets is in noninterest income and noninterest expense  these portfolios are included in the interest sensitivity analysis because they have attributes similar to interest earning assets 
economic value of equity eve analysis is used to measure the sensitivity of the values of period end assets and liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
eve serves as a complement to income simulation modeling as it provides risk exposure estimates for time periods beyond the one year simulation period 
the models used for these measurements take into account prepayment speeds on mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  and consumer installment loans  as well as cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
balance sheet growth assumptions are also considered in the income simulation model 
the models include the effects of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  and other types of interest rate options 
the baseline scenario for income simulation analysis  with which all other scenarios are compared  is based on market interest rates implied by the prevailing yield curve as of the period end 
alternative interest rate scenarios are then compared with the baseline scenario 
these alternative interest rate scenarios include parallel rate shifts on both a gradual and immediate basis  movements in interest rates that alter the shape of the yield curve eg  flatter or steeper yield curve  and current interest rates remaining unchanged for the 
table of contents entire measurement period 
scenarios are also developed to measure short term repricing risks  such as the impact of libor based interest rates rising or falling faster than the prime rate 
the simulations for evaluating short term interest rate risk exposure are scenarios that model gradual and basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates over the next month period beyond the interest rate change implied by the current yield curve 
we assumed that market interest rates would not fall below over the next month period for the scenarios that used the and basis point parallel shift in market interest rates 
the table below shows the results of the scenarios as of december   and december  all of the positions were within the board of directors policy limits 
table net interest income at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december  december  the net interest income at risk reported as of december  for the basis points scenario shows a change to a slight near term liability sensitive position compared with december  net interest income at risk reflects actions taken by management to improve the liquidity position of the balance sheet and improvements made in modeling assumptions regarding deposit pricing 
the primary factors contributing to the change include incremental liability sensitivity reflecting the net impact of the execution of billion receive fixed interest rates swaps during  partially offset by billion receive fixed interest rates swap maturities and early terminations  to offset the impact of actual and anticipated reductions in fixed rate assets 
incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the decrease in floating rate debt and an increase in deposits and net free funds 
incremental liability sensitivity reflecting the purchase of securities to maintain a higher liquidity position 
incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the sale of municipal securities  the securitization and sale of automobile loans  and the sale of residential mortgage loans  slightly offset by an increase in other securities 
incremental liability sensitivity reflecting an update to deposit pricing models 
incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the anticipated slow down in fixed rate loan originations due to customer preferences for variable rate loans 
the primary simulations for eve at risk assume immediate and basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates beyond the interest rate change implied by the current yield curve 
the table below outlines the december   results compared with december  all of the positions were within the board of directors policy limits 

table of contents table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december  december  the eve at risk reported as of december  for the basis points scenario shows a change to a higher long term liability sensitive position compared with december   reflecting actions taken by management to improve the capital and liquidity position of the balance sheet  and improvements made in modeling assumptions regarding deposit pricing and mortgage asset prepayments 
the primary factors contributing to the change include incremental liability sensitivity reflecting the purchase of securities to maintain a higher liquidity position 
incremental liability sensitivity reflecting the execution of billion receive fixed interest rates swaps during  partially offset by billion receive fixed interest rates swap maturities and early terminations  to offset the impact of actual and anticipated reductions in fixed rate assets 
incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the sale of municipal securities  the securitization of indirect auto loans  and the sale of residential mortgage loans  slightly offset by an increase in other securities 
incremental asset sensitivity reflecting the improvements made in modeling assumptions regarding deposit pricing  mortgage asset prepayments  and implied forward yield curves 
the remainder of the change in eve at risk for the basis points scenario was primarily related to a change in market rates throughout the year as longer term interest rates implied by the current yield curve increased resulting in incremental liability sensitivity 
mortgage servicing rights msrs this section should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans 
of this million  million was recorded using the fair value method  and million was recorded using the amortization method 
if we actively engage in hedging  the msr asset is carried at fair value 
if we do not actively engage in hedging  the msr asset is adjusted using the amortization method  and is carried at the lower of cost or market value 
msr fair values are very sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans  which can be greatly reduced by prepayments 
prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise 
we have employed strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment 
in addition  we engage a third party to provide improved valuation tools and assistance with our strategies with the objective to decrease the volatility from msr fair value changes 
however  volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these hedges 
we typically report msr fair value adjustments net of hedge related trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income 
changes in fair value between reporting dates are recorded as an increase or decrease in mortgage banking income 
msrs recorded using the amortization method generally relate to loans originated with historically low interest rates  resulting in a lower probability of prepayments and  ultimately  impairment 
msr assets are included in other assets  and are presented in table 
table of contents price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting 
we have price risk from trading securities  securities owned by our broker dealer subsidiaries  foreign exchange positions  equity investments  investments in securities backed by mortgage loans  and marketable equity securities held by our insurance subsidiaries 
we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio  on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained  and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held by the insurance subsidiaries 
equity investment portfolios in reviewing our equity investment portfolio  we consider general economic and market conditions  including industries in which private equity merchant banking and community development investments are made  and adverse changes affecting the availability of capital 
we determine any impairment based on all of the information available at the time of the assessment 
new information or economic developments in the future could result in the recognition of additional impairment 
investment decisions that incorporate credit risk require the approval of the independent credit administration function 
the degree of initial due diligence and subsequent review is a function of the type  size  and collateral of the investment 
performance is monitored on a regular basis  and reported to the mrc 
from time to time  we invest in various investments with equity risk 
such investments include investment funds that buy and sell publicly traded securities  investment funds that hold securities of private companies  direct equity or venture capital investments in companies public and private  and direct equity or venture capital interests in private companies in connection with our mezzanine lending activities 
these investments are included in accrued income and other assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   we had a total of million of such investments  down from million at december  net gains related to these equity investments totaled million in  compared with net losses of million in the losses reflected a million venture capital loss  and million of losses on public equity funds that bought and sold primarily publicly traded securities 
these investments were primarily in funds that focused on the financial services sector that  during  performed worse than the broad equity market 
in  we sold these public equity fund investments 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments resulting from external macro market issues  investor and customer perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to the company such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
we manage liquidity risk at both the bank and at the parent company  huntington bancshares incorporated hbi 
the overall objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations  as well as maintain sufficient levels of on hand liquidity  under both normal business as usual and unanticipated  stressed circumstances 
the risk management committee was appointed by the hbi board risk committee to oversee liquidity risk management and establish policies and limits  based upon analyses of the ratio of loans to deposits  liquid asset coverage ratios  the percentage of assets funded with noncore or wholesale funding  net cash capital  liquid assets  and emergency borrowing capacity 
in addition  operating guidelines are established to ensure that bank loans included in the retail and business banking  commercial banking  commercial real estate  and pfg business segments are funded with core deposits 
these operating guidelines also ensure diversification of noncore funding by type  source  and maturity and provide sufficient liquidity to cover of wholesale funds maturing within a six month period 
a contingency funding plan is in place  which includes forecasted sources and uses of funds under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages  including the implications of any credit rating changes and or other trigger events related to financial ratios  deposit fluctuations  debt issuance capacity  stock performance  or negative news related to us or the banking industry 
liquidity risk is reviewed 
table of contents monthly for the bank and the parent company  as well as its subsidiaries 
in addition  liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions  provide policy guidance  review funding strategies  and oversee adherence to  and the maintenance of  the contingency funding plan s 
a contingency funding working group monitors daily cash flow trends  branch activity  unfunded commitments  significant transactions  and parent company subsidiary sources and uses of funds in order to identify areas of concern  and establish specific funding strategies 
this group works closely with the risk management committee and the hbi communication team in order to identify issues that may require a more proactive communication plan to shareholders  employees  and customers regarding specific events or issues that could have an impact on our liquidity position 
in the normal course of business  in order to better manage liquidity risk  we perform stress tests to determine the effect that a potential downgrade in our credit ratings or other market disruptions could have on liquidity over various time periods 
these credit ratings  which are presented in table  have a direct impact on our cost of funds and ability to raise funds under normal  as well as adverse  circumstances 
the results of these stress tests indicate that sufficient sources of funds are available to meet our financial obligations and fund our operations for a month period 
the stress test scenarios include testing to determine the impact of an interruption to our access to the national markets for funding  significant run off in core deposits and liquidity triggers inherent in other financial agreements 
to compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures  we consider alternative sources of liquidity over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed 
the specific alternatives for enhancing liquidity include generating client deposits  securitizing or selling loans  selling or maturing of securities  and extending the level or maturity of wholesale borrowings 
most credit markets in which we participate and rely upon as sources of funding have been significantly disrupted and highly volatile since mid reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally  many lenders reduced  and in some cases  ceased unsecured funding to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
since that time  as a means of maintaining adequate liquidity  we  like many other financial institutions  have relied more heavily on the liquidity and stability present in the secured credit markets since access to unsecured term debt has been restricted 
throughout this period  we continued to extend maturities ensuring that we maintained adequate liquidity in the event the crisis became prolonged 
in addition to managing our maturities  we strengthened our overall liquidity position by significantly reducing our noncore funds and wholesale borrowings  and increasing our overall level of liquid assets 
shifting from the net purchasing of overnight federal funds to an excess reserve position at the end of the first quarter  as well as significantly increasing the level of free securities  has significantly improved our on hand liquidity 
however  we are part of a financial system  and a systemic lack of available credit  a lack of confidence in the financial sector  and increased volatility in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect our liquidity position 
bank liquidity and sources of liquidity our primary sources of funding for the bank are retail and commercial core deposits 
as of december   these core deposits  of which our retail and business banking business segment provided  funded of total assets 
at december   total core deposits represented of total deposits  an increase from at the prior year end 
core deposits are comprised of interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand deposits  money market deposits  savings and other domestic time deposits  consumer certificates of deposit both over and under  and nonconsumer certificates of deposit less than  noncore deposits consist of brokered money market deposits and certificates of deposit  foreign time deposits  and other domestic time deposits of  or more comprised primarily of public fund certificates of deposit more than  core deposits may increase our need for liquidity as certificates of deposit mature or are withdrawn before maturity and as nonmaturity deposits  such as checking and savings account balances  are withdrawn 
specifically  if the fdic permits the transaction account guarantee program tagp to expire as scheduled on june   customers may elect to reduce their deposits with us in an effort to maintain deposit 
table of contents insurance coverage 
the tagp is a voluntary program provided by the fdic as part of its tlgp 
under the program  all noninterest bearing transaction accounts are fully guaranteed by the fdic for the customer s entire account balance 
this program provides our customers with additional deposit insurance coverage  and is in addition to and separate from the  coverage available under the fdic s general deposit insurance rules 
at december   noninterest bearing transaction account balances exceeding  totaled billion  and represented the amount of noninterest bearing transaction customer deposits that would not have been fdic insured without the additional coverage provided by the tagp 
as referenced in the above paragraph  the fdic establishes a coverage limit  generally  currently  for interest bearing deposit balances 
to provide our customers deposit insurance above the established  we have joined the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars  a program that allows customers to invest up to million in certificates of deposit through one participating financial institution  with the entire amount covered by fdic insurance 
at december   we had million of cdars deposit balances 
demand deposit overdrafts that have been reclassified as loan balances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
domestic time deposits of  or more  brokered deposits and negotiable cds totaled billion at the end of and billion at the end of the contractual maturities of these deposits at december  were as follows billion in three months or less  billion in three months through six months  billion in six months through twelve months  and billion after twelve months

at december   total wholesale funding was billion  a decrease from billion at december  the billion portfolio at december   had a weighted average maturity of years 
various strategies described below  as well as growth in core deposits  reduced our reliance on wholesale borrowings

our actions taken during resulted in a billion increase in our unpledged investment securities  b billion increase in available cash and due from banks  c billion automobile loan securitization  d billion sale of municipal securities  e billion debt issuance as part of the tlgp  and f billion mortgage loan sale 
any proceeds from these actions were used primarily to pay down wholesale borrowings 
in addition to these actions  core deposits grew billion during this increase reduced our reliance upon noncore funding sources 
in addition  our loan to deposit ratio improved to at december   compared with at december  in late  we redeemed million aggregate principle amount of certain subordinated notes issued previously by the bank 
this capital at the bank was replaced with an intercompany subordinated note from the parent company in the amount of million with a term of years 
a pretax gain of million was recorded reflecting the difference between the carrying value of the notes and the purchase price of the debt  net of expenses and associated interest rate swaps 
this transaction increased the quantity and quality of the bank s capital  and did not have a material impact on our liquidity position 
the bank has access to the federal reserve s discount window and term auction facility taf 
these borrowings are secured by commercial loans and home equity lines of credit 
the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb cincinnati  and as such  has access to advances from this facility 
these advances are generally secured by residential mortgages  other mortgage related loans  and available for sale securities

a portion of the cash proceeds received from the common stock issuances were used to purchase investment securities 
based on the current dividend of per common share  cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately million per quarter 
we recognize the importance of the 
table of contents dividend to our shareholders 
while our overall capital and liquidity positions are strong  extreme economic market deterioration and the changing regulatory environment drove the difficult but prudent decision to reduce the dividend during the first quarter to per common share 
this proactive measure contributed to growth in capital and the strengthening of our balance sheet 
table provides additional detail regarding quarterly dividends declared per common share 
during  we issued an aggregate million of series a non cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock will pay  as declared by our board of directors  dividends in cash at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the first and second quarters  we entered into agreements with various institutional investors exchanging shares of our common stock for shares of the series a preferred stock held by them see capital capital adequacy discussion 
in the aggregate  these exchanges are anticipated to reduce our total dividend cash requirements common  series a preferred stock  and series b preferred stock by an estimated million per quarter 
considering these exchanges and the current dividend  cash demands required for series a preferred stock are estimated to be approximately million per quarter 
also during  we received billion of equity capital by issuing million shares of series b preferred stock to the us department of treasury as a result of our participation in the tarp voluntary cpp 
the series b preferred stock will pay cumulative dividends at a rate of per year for the first five years and per year thereafter  resulting in quarterly cash demands of approximately million through  and million thereafter see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the series b preferred stock issuance 
based on a regulatory dividend limitation  the bank could not have declared and paid a dividend to the parent company at december   without regulatory approval 
we do not anticipate that the bank will request regulatory approval to pay dividends in the near future as we continue to build bank regulatory capital above our already well capitalized level 
to help meet any additional liquidity needs  we have an open ended  automatic shelf registration statement filed and effective with the sec  which permits us to issue an unspecified amount of debt or equity securities 
with the exception of the common and preferred dividends previously discussed  the parent company does not have any significant cash demands 
there are no maturities of parent company obligations until  when a debt maturity of million is payable 
considering the factors discussed above  and other analyses that we have performed  we believe the parent company has sufficient liquidity to meet its cash flow obligations for the foreseeable future 
credit ratings credit ratings provided by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of our liquidity profile 
among other factors  the credit ratings are based on financial strength  credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio  the level and volatility of earnings  capital adequacy  the quality of management  the liquidity of the balance sheet  the availability of a significant base of core deposits  and our ability to access a broad array of wholesale funding sources 
adverse changes in these factors could result in a negative change in credit ratings and impact our ability to raise funds at a reasonable cost in the capital markets 
in addition  certain financial on and off balance sheet arrangements contain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs if a negative rating change occurs 
other arrangements that could be impacted by credit rating changes include  but are not limited to  letter of credit commitments for marketable securities  interest rate swap collateral agreements  and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions or could otherwise be impacted by credit rating changes 

table of contents the most recent credit ratings for the parent company and the bank are as follows table credit ratings december  senior unsecured subordinated notes notes short term outlook huntington bancshares incorporated moody s investor service baa baa p negative standard and poor s bb bb b negative fitch ratings bbb bbb f negative the huntington national bank moody s investor service baa baa p negative standard and poor s bbb bb a negative fitch ratings bbb bbb f negative during  all three rating agencies lowered their credit ratings for both the parent company and the bank 
the credit ratings to senior unsecured notes  subordinated notes  and short term debt were changed 
the above table reflects these changes 
during the third quarter  fitch ratings reaffirmed the ratings given to both the parent company and the bank 
the fhlb uses the bank s credit rating in its calculation of borrowing capacity 
as a result of these credit rating changes  the fhlb reduced our borrowing capacity by million during the first quarter 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell  or hold securities  is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into various off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include financial guarantees contained in standby letters of credit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing  and similar transactions 
most of these arrangements mature within two years  and are expected to expire without being drawn upon 
standby letters of credit are included in the determination of the amount of risk based capital that the parent company  and the bank  are required to hold 
through our credit process  we monitor the credit risks of outstanding standby letters of credit 
when it is probable that a standby letter of credit will be drawn and not repaid in full  losses are recognized in the provision for credit losses 
at december   we had billion of standby letters of credit outstanding  of which were collateralized 
included in this billion total are letters of credit issued by the bank that support securities that were issued by our customers and remarketed by the huntington investment company hic  our broker dealer subsidiary 
due to the credit rating changes in noted above  and pursuant to the letters of credit issued by the bank  the bank repurchased substantially all of these securities  net of payments and maturities  during as a result of these repurchases  only million of these standby letters of credit remained outstanding at december  we enter into forward contracts relating to the mortgage banking business to hedge the exposures we have from commitments to extend new residential mortgage loans to our customers and from our held for sale mortgage loans 
at december  and december   we had commitments to sell residential real estate loans of million and million  respectively 
these contracts mature in less than one year 

table of contents during the first quarter  we transferred billion automobile loans and leases to a trust in a securitization transaction 
the securitization qualified for sale accounting under asc we retained million of the related securities and recorded a million retained residual interest as a result of the transaction 
subsequent to the transaction  we sold million of these securities in the second quarter 
these amounts were recorded as investment securities on our balance sheet 
we also recorded a million loss in other noninterest income on our income statement and recorded a million servicing asset in accrued income and other assets associated with this transaction 
in  amended guidance was issued by fasb with respect to this type of transaction 
with our adoption of this amended guidance in  the trust was consolidated on january  see note of the notes to the financial statements for additional details

operational risk as with all companies  we are subject to operational risk 
operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error  inadequate or failed internal systems and controls  violations of  or noncompliance with  laws  rules  regulations  prescribed practices  or ethical standards  and external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  and security risks 
we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws  rules  and regulations  and to improve the oversight of our operational risk 
risk management manages the risk for the company through processes that assess the overall level of risk on a regular basis and identifies specific risks and the steps being taken to mitigate them 
to mitigate operational and compliance risks  we have established a senior management level operational risk committee  headed by the chief operational risk officer  and a senior management level legal  regulatory  and compliance committee  headed by the director of corporate compliance 
the responsibilities of these committees  among other things  include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns  risks  or trends that may have a significant impact and develop recommendations to address the identified issues 
both of these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the executive level risk management committee  headed by the chief risk officer 
additionally  potential concerns may be escalated to the risk committee of the board of directors  as appropriate 
the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies  minimize operational losses  and strengthen our overall performance

capital levels are maintained based on regulatory capital requirements and the economic capital required to support credit  market  liquidity  and operational risks inherent in our business  and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and new business opportunities 
shareholders equity totaled billion at december  this represented a decrease compared with billion at december   primarily reflecting the negative impact of the billion goodwill impairment charge  partially offset by the issuance of million new shares of common stock  through two common stock offerings and three discretionary equity issuance programs  worth billion  and the exchange of a portion of our series a preferred stock for million shares of our common stock worth billion see tier common equity section below 
tier common equity during  a key priority was to strengthen our capital position in order to withstand potential future credit losses should the economic environment continue to deteriorate 
during the second quarter  the federal reserve conducted a supervisory capital assessment program scap on the country s largest bank holding companies to determine the amount of capital required to absorb losses that could arise under baseline and more adverse economic scenarios 
the scap results determined that a tier common capital risk based ratio of at least would be needed 
a total of of the bank holding companies were directed to increase their capital levels to meet this threshold 
while we were not one of these institutions required by the federal reserve to conduct a forward looking capital assessment  or stress test  we believed it important that we have an equivalent relative amount of capital to meet the official scap threshold of a tier common capital risk based ratio 
as such  in may of  we conducted an internal analysis designed to emulate the scap more adverse economic scenario based on december   portfolio balances as modeled by the federal reserve 
as a result of that analysis  we disclosed on may   that we estimated million of tier common equity was needed in addition to that already obtained through that date 
by june   substantially all of that capital had been obtained 
on september   we announced the completion of a third discretionary equity issuance program that raised a net million of common equity  thus exceeding the remaining capital needed indicated by our internal scap analysis 
on that same date september   we announced a new million common stock offering as favorable market conditions and investor interest presented an opportunity to continue to build common equity efficiently to the long term benefit of our shareholders 
on september   we announced the completion of this common stock offering  which resulted in a net million issuance of common equity 
this capital  over and above that indicated by our internal scap analysis  increases our flexibility to repurchase debt and improve our overall funding 
further  it provides additional capacity to pursue growth of our core businesses  which includes supporting organic asset and deposit growth 
this capital also provides us with sufficient capital to withstand a stressed economic scenario  allows us to take advantage of initiatives identified through our strategic planning effort currently underway  and significantly enhances our ability to eventually repay our billion of tarp capital

as shown in the table above  these actions increased our tier common equity by billion during while we may continue to seek opportunities to further strengthen our capital position  we believe that we have sufficient capital to withstand a severe economic scenario similar to that used by the federal reserve in its modeling of capital adequacy for the large bank holding companies where stress tests were conducted

these financial measures have been included as they are considered to be critical metrics with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength 
other companies may calculate these financial measures differently 
based on an interim decision by the banking agencies on december   we have excluded the impact of adopting asc topic  compensation retirement benefits  from the regulatory capital calculations 
as shown in the above table  our consolidated tce ratio was at december   an increase from at december  the basis point increase from december   primarily reflected the million aggregate of new common stock offering issuances  the million conversion of 
table of contents series a preferred stock to common stock  as well as the reducing of our balance sheet through the securitizing of automobile loans  and the selling of a portion of our municipal securities portfolio  as well as mortgage loans 
regulatory capital regulatory capital ratios are the primary metrics used by regulators in assessing the safety and soundness of banks 
we intend to maintain both the company s and the bank s risk based capital ratios at levels at which each would be considered well capitalized by regulators 
the bank is primarily supervised and regulated by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ  which establishes regulatory capital guidelines for banks similar to those established for bank holding companies by the federal reserve board 
regulatory capital primarily consists of tier capital and tier capital 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital equals our total risk based capital

at december   the parent company had tier and total risk based capital in excess of the minimum level required to be considered well capitalized of billion and billion  respectively 
our risk weighted capital ratios improved during compared with the prior year 
the primary driver of these improvements was the billion of net proceeds from the three discretionary equity issuance programs  conversions from preferred stock to common stock  and the common stock public offering completed in additionally  risk weighted assets declined during the  as both loans outstanding and unfunded loan commitments decreased 
these improvements were slightly offset by an increase in the amount of our net deferred tax asset that was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes 
regulations require that we deduct from our tier capital any amount that we cannot demonstrate the ability to recover within the next months 
this adjustment to regulatory capital has no impact on our assessment of the realizability of our net deferred tax asset 
in late  we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of certain subordinated notes issued previously by the bank 
this capital at the bank was replaced with an intercompany subordinated note from the parent company in the amount of million with a term of years 
a pretax gain of million was recorded reflecting the difference between the carrying value of the notes and the purchase price of the debt  net of expenses and associated interest rate swaps 
on a consolidated basis  this transaction reduced our tier capital by million and increased our tier capital by million  which included gain on the extinguishment of debt net of fees and associated interest rate swaps 
the bank s risk weighted assets declined compared with december   as both loans outstanding and unfunded loan commitments decreased 
at december   the bank had tier and total risk based capital in excess of the minimum level required to be considered well capitalized of billion and billion  respectively 
preferred stock tarp in  we issued an aggregate million of series a preferred stock 
the series a preferred stock is nonvoting and may be convertible at any time  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock 
shares of series a preferred stock held by investors is not a component of tier common equity 
as previously discussed see tier common equity section  we entered into agreements with 
table of contents various institutional investors exchanging million shares of our common stock for million shares of the series a preferred stock held by them during these transactions increased common equity by million  while preferred equity decreased by the same amount 
during  we received billion of equity capital by issuing million shares of series b preferred stock to the us department of treasury  and a ten year warrant to purchase up to million shares of our common stock  par value per share  at an exercise price of per share 
the proceeds received were allocated to the preferred stock and additional paid in capital 
the resulting discount on the preferred stock will be amortized  resulting in additional dilution to our earnings per share 
the series b preferred stock is not a component of tier common equity 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the series b preferred stock issuance 
other capital matters to accelerate the building of capital  we reduced our quarterly common stock dividend to per common share  effective with the dividend paid april  on february   our repurchase program was terminated 
additionally  as a condition to participate in the tarp  we may not repurchase any shares without prior approval from the department of treasury 
no shares were repurchased during as shown in the table  our book value per share declined to per share at december   from per share at december  this decline reflected the net loss applicable to common shares in  which included a billion impairment of our goodwill see the goodwill discussion located within the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section 
our tangible book value per share  which excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from equity  declined to per share at december   from at december  this decline was significantly less  on both an absolute and relative basis  compared with the decline in book value per share  as the size of the net loss applicable to common shares reflected the goodwill impairment in and had no impact to tangible equity 
tangible book value per share also declined as a result of the issuance of million common shares in  through two common stock offerings and three discretionary equity issuance programs  at an average net proceeds of per share 
business segment discussion overview this section reviews financial performance from a business segment perspective and should be read in conjunction with the discussion of results of operations  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and other sections for a full understanding of our consolidated financial performance 
we have five major business segments retail and business banking  commercial banking  commercial real estate  auto finance and dealer services afds  and the private financial group pfg 
a treasury other function includes other unallocated assets  liabilities  revenue  and expense 
for each of our business segments  we expect the combination of our business model and exceptional service to provide a competitive advantage that supports revenue and earnings growth 
our business model emphasizes the delivery of a complete set of banking products and services offered by larger banks  but distinguished by local decision making regarding the pricing and offering of these products 
funds transfer pricing we use a centralized funds transfer pricing ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments 
the treasury other business segment charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment 
the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities  and includes an estimate for the cost of liquidity liquidity premium 
deposits of an indeterminate maturity receive an ftp credit based on a combination of vintage based average lives and replicating portfolio pool rates 
other assets  liabilities  and 
table of contents capital are charged credited with a four year moving average ftp rate 
the intent of the ftp methodology is to eliminate all interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities 
the result is to centralize the financial impact  management  and reporting of interest rate and liquidity risk in the treasury other function where it can be monitored and managed 
the denominator in net interest margin calculation has been modified to add the amount of net funds provided by each business segment for all periods presented 
in  a comprehensive review of our ftp methodology resulted in changes to various assumptions  including liquidity premiums 
ftp rates charged to business segments holding commercial loans  and credited to segments holding indeterminate maturity and time deposits  were impacted most 
business segment financial performance for reflect the methodology changes  however  financial performance for was not restated to reflect these changes as the changes for that year were not material 
the impact of this methodology change to financial performance was a million increase in the net interest margin for treasury other compared with results under the previous methodology  and an aggregate decrease to the net interest margin of the other five business segments by the same amount 
as a result of this change  business segment performance for net interest income comparisons between and are affected 
fee sharing our business segments operate in cooperation to provide products and services to our customers 
revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service 
fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers 
the most significant revenues for which fee sharing is recorded relate to customer derivatives and brokerage services  which are recorded by pfg and shared primarily with retail and business banking and commercial banking 
results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations 
expense allocation business segment results are determined based upon our management reporting system  which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments 
the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and  accordingly  the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions 
the management accounting process used to develop the business segment reporting utilized various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments 
expenses are allocated to business segments using a two phase approach 
the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activity based costs to activities incident to product origination and servicing 
these activity based costs are then extended  based on volumes  with the resulting amount allocated to business segments which own the related products 
the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all five business segments from treasury other 
during  we implemented a full allocation methodology  where all treasury other expenses  except those related to servicing franklin assets  reported significant items excluding the goodwill impairment  and a small residual of other unallocated expenses  are allocated to the other five business segments 
prior to this implementation  only certain expenses were allocated to the five business segments 
business segment financial performance for reflect the implementation  however  financial performance for was not restated due to impracticability 
as a result of this change  business segment performance comparisons for noninterest expense between and are affected 
treasury other the treasury other function includes revenue and expense related to assets  liabilities  and equity not directly assigned or allocated to one of the five business segments 
assets include investment securities  bank owned life insurance  and the loans and oreo properties acquired through the first quarter franklin restructuring 
the financial impact associated with our ftp methodology  as described above  is also included 
net interest income includes the impact of administering our investment securities portfolios and the net impact of derivatives used to hedge interest rate sensitivity 
noninterest income includes miscellaneous fee 
table of contents income not allocated to other business segments such as bank owned life insurance income  and any investment securities and trading assets gains or losses 
noninterest expense includes certain corporate administrative  merger  and other miscellaneous expenses not allocated to other business segments 
the provision for income taxes for the business segments is calculated at a statutory tax rate  though our overall effective tax rate is lower 
as a result  treasury other reflects a credit for income taxes representing the difference between the lower actual effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate used to allocate income taxes to the business segments 
net income by business segment we reported a net loss of  million during this compared with a net loss of million during the segregation of net income by business segment for and is presented in the following table year ended december  in thousands retail and business banking commercial banking commercial real estate afds pfg treasury other unallocated goodwill impairment total net loss income represents the first quarter impairment charge  net of tax  associated with the former regional banking business segment

versus retail and business banking reported a net loss of million in  compared with net income of million in the most notable factor contributing to this million decrease was a million increase to the provision for credit losses  reflecting a the continued economic weaknesses in our markets  b an increase of commercial reserves resulting from credit actions taken during see commercial loan portfolio review and actions section located within the commercial credit section for additional information  and c a million increase in ncos 
our consumer loan ncos increased million  primarily reflecting a the sale of underperforming mortgage loans that were written down to their fair value prior to sale  b a more conservative position regarding the timing of loss recognition in our residential mortgage portfolio  and c the higher unemployment rate  particularly in our michigan and northern ohio markets

table of contents income taxes this section should be read in conjunction with significant item the provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter was a benefit of million 
the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was a tax benefit of 
at december   we had a net federal deferred tax asset of million  and a net state deferred tax asset of million 
based on our ability to offset a portion of the net deferred tax asset against taxable income in prior years and level of our forecast of future taxable income  there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at december  credit quality credit quality performance in the fourth quarter continued to be negatively impacted by the sustained economic weakness in our midwest markets  but there were signs of stabilization 
as an example  there was an overall decline of million  or  in npas 
furthermore  the level of criticized and classified loans increased at a much lower rate than prior quarters 
net charge offs ncos this section should be read in conjunction with significant item total ncos for the fourth quarter were million  or an annualized of average total loans and leases 
ncos in the year ago quarter were million  or an annualized  including million related to franklin 
total non franklin related commercial ncos increased million from the year ago quarter 
total consumer ncos increased million 
total c i ncos for the fourth quarter were million  or an annualized  down from million  or an annualized of related loans  in the year ago quarter 
c i ncos in the year ago quarter included million related to franklin 
non franklin related c i ncos increased million compared with the year ago quarter 
fourth quarter results were substantially impacted by individual charge offs in excess of million  as there was million associated with the activity on five relationships 
the specific circumstances of each occurrence were distinct to the relationship in question  but the impact of the economic conditions was the proximate cause for each 
primarily as a result of these larger individual charge offs  there was a regional concentration of losses in our northeast and central ohio regions 
while there continues to be concern regarding the impact of the economic conditions on our commercial customers  the lower inflow of new nonaccruals and the significant decline in early stage delinquencies  compared with earlier levels  supports our outlook for improved performance in current quarter cre ncos were million  or an annualized  up from million  or an annualized in the year ago quarter 
retail projects and single family homebuilders continued to represent a significant portion  or  of the losses 
included in the retail portfolio results were million of charge offs associated with three projects 
we continued our ongoing portfolio management efforts including obtaining updated appraisals on properties and assessing a project status within the context of market environment expectations 
historically we have thought of the single family homebuilder portfolio and retail portfolios as the highest risk segments  in that order 
based on the portfolio management processes  including charge off activity over the past two and one half years  the credit issues in the single family homebuilder portfolio have been substantially addressed 
the retail property portfolio remains more susceptible to the ongoing market disruption  but we also believe that the combination of prior charge offs and existing reserve balances positions us well to make effective credit decisions in the future 
total consumer ncos in the current quarter were million  or an annualized  up from million  or an annualized of average total consumer loans in the year ago quarter 
the fourth quarter results represented a continuation of our loss mitigation programs and active loss recognition processes 
this includes accounts in all stages of performance  including bankruptcy 
residential mortgage ncos were million  or an annualized of related average balances  up from million  or an annualized in the year ago quarter 
during the current quarter  we continued to 
table of contents see positive trends in early stage delinquencies  indicating that even with the economic stress on our customers  losses are expected to remain manageable 
home equity ncos in the fourth quarter were million  or an annualized 
this was up from million  or an annualized  in the year ago quarter 
although ncos were higher compared with prior quarters  there continued to be a declining trend in the early stage delinquency level in the home equity line of credit portfolio  supporting our longer term positive view for home equity portfolio performance 
the higher losses resulted from a significant increase in loss mitigation activity and short sales 
we continue to believe that our more proactive loss mitigation strategies are in the best interest of both the company and our customers 
while there has been a clear increase in the losses over the course of  given the market conditions  performance remained within expectations 
automobile loan and lease ncos were million  or an annualized  down from million  or an annualized  in the year ago quarter 
performance of this portfolio on both an absolute and relative basis continued to be consistent with our views regarding the underlying quality of the portfolio 
the level of delinquencies have improved compared with the year ago period  supporting our view of flat to improved performance going forward 
nonaccrual loans nal and nonperforming assets npa total nals were  million at december   and represented of total loans and leases 
this was up million  or  from  million  or compared with december  the increase from the year ago quarter primarily reflected increases in cre and non franklin related c i nals

npas  which include nals  were  million at december   and represented of related assets 
this was significantly higher than  million  or of related assets at the end of the year ago period 
the million increase in npas from the end of the year ago period reflected the million increase in nals 
the over day delinquent  but still accruing  ratio excluding loans guaranteed by the us government  was at december   down basis points from a year ago 
on this same basis  the over day delinquency ratio for total consumer loans was at december   up from a year ago 
allowance for credit losses acl this section should be in read in conjunction with notes and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter we conducted a review of our acl practices 
based on recent asset quality trends  coupled with a fragile economic outlook  the acl was significantly increased  reflecting a fourth quarter provision for credit losses of million  which was more than double the level of the fourth quarter charge offs 
we experienced an increasing trend in charge offs throughout the level of criticized loans  an indicator of possible losses  continued to increase through the fourth quarter  although the increases in the second half of were at a slower rate compared with the first half of while we did show a decline in the level of npas at december   the inflow of million remained substantially higher than would be the case in a stable credit environment 
nevertheless  this was the lowest level of new nals in five quarters 
based on these asset quality trends  in conjunction with a fragile economy particularly in our midwest markets  the acl was increased 
much of the increase related to our cre retail portfolio where higher vacancy rates  lower rents  and falling property values are of significant concern 
loss in the event of default on many classes of cre properties has increased substantially throughout and this is expected to continue into 
table of contents additionally  c i customers have been suffering from the weak economy for several consecutive years and some of these customers no longer have the capital base to withstand protracted stress and  therefore  may not be able to comply with the original terms of their credit agreements
