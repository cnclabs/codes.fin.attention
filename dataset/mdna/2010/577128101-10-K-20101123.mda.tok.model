the company continues to remain cautious in its growth expectations for fiscal although several segments have seen signs of economic improvement  the company expects ongoing challenges from global and domestic economic conditions  which may affect the consistency of results on a quarterly basis 
in the memorialization businesses  the decline in us casketed deaths and in ground burials  and rising commodity costs present continuing challenges 
in addition  foreign currency values such as the euro have been more volatile recently  complicating forecast models for both the memorialization and brand solutions businesses 
however  the company has been encouraged by a recent trend of stable and improving order rates in the brand solutions businesses and the performance of recent acquis itions

item management s discussion and analysis  continued critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment based on various assumptions and other factors such as historical experience  economic conditions  and in some cases  actuarial techniques 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
a discussion of market risks affecting the company can be found in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  of this annual report on for m k 
the company s significant accounting policies are included in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k

the following accounting policies involve significant estimates  which were considered critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended september  trade receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts 
trade credit is generally extended on a short term basis  thus trade receivables do not bear interest  although a finance charge may be applied to such receivables that are more than days past due 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on an evaluation of specific customer accounts for which available facts and circumstances indicate collectibility may be uncertain 
in addition  the allowance includes a reserve for all customers based on historical collection experience 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets are carried at cost 
depreciation on property  plant and equipment is computed primarily on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is determined by evaluating the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value which is based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to periodic review for impairment 
in general  when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss must be recognized 
for purposes of testing for impairment  the company uses a combination of valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  unless such lives are considered to be indefinite 
a significant decline in cash flows generated from these assets may result in a write down of the carrying values of the related assets 
the company performed its annual impairment reviews in the second quarters of fiscal  and and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of goodwill or other intangibles with ind efinite lives were necessary at those times 
share based payment stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
item management s discussion and analysis  continued pension and postretirement benefits pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate used to determine the present value of benefit obligations 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets  the expected return on plan assets and changes in the selected discount rate will affect the amount of pension cost 
the company s principal pension plan maintains a substantial portion of its assets in equity securities in accordance with the investment policy established by the company s pension board

for pre need sales of memorials and vases  revenue is recognized when the memorial has been manufactured to the customer s specifications eg  name and birth date  title has been transferred to the customer and the memorial and vase are placed in storage for future delivery

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company has market risk related to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not generally use derivative financial instruments in connection with these market risks  except as noted below 
interest rates the company s most significant long term debt instrument is the domestic revolving credit facility  which bears interest at variable rates based on libor 
the company has entered into the following interest rate swaps date initial amount fixed interest rate interest rate spread at september  maturity date september million september may million september october million october october million october the interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of the future variable interest payments under the revolving credit facility which are considered probable of occurring 
based on the company s assessment  all the critical terms of each of the hedges matched the underlying terms of the hedged debt and related forecasted interest payments  and as such  these hedges were considered highly effective 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps reflected an unrealized loss of million million after tax at september  that is included in equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
a decrease of in market interest rates eg a decrease from to would result in an increase of approximately  in the fair value liability of the interest rate swaps

an adverse change strengthening dollar of in exchange rates would have resulted in a decrease in reported sales of million and a decrease in reported operating income of million for the year ended september  actuarial assumptions the most significant actuarial assumptions affecting pension expense and pension obligations include the valuation of retirement plan assets  the discount rate and the estimated return on plan assets 
the estimated return on plan assets is currently based upon projections provided by the company s independent investment advisor  considering the investment policy of the plan and the plan s asset allocation 
the fair value of plan assets and discount rate are point in time measures  and the recent volatility of the debt and equity markets makes estimating future changes in fair value of plan assets and discount rates more challenging 
the following table summarizes the impact on the september  actuarial valuations of changes in the primary assumptions affecting the company s retirement plans and supplemental retirement plan 
impact of changes in actuarial assumptions change in discount rate change in expected return change in market value of assets dollar amounts in thousands increase decrease in net benefit cost increase decrease in projected benefit obligation increase decrease in funded status
