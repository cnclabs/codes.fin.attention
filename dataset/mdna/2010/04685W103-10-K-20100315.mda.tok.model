item business 
overview athenahealth is a leading provider of internet based business services for physician practices 
our service offerings are based on four integrated components our proprietary internet based software  our continually updated database of payer reimbursement process rules  our back office service operations that perform administrative aspects of billing and clinical data management for physician practices  and our automated and live patient communication services 
our principal offering  athenacollector  automates and manages billing 
table of contents related functions for physician practices and includes a medical practice management platform 
we have also developed a service offering  athenaclinicals  that automates and manages medical record related functions for physician practices and includes an electronic health record  or ehr  platform 
remindercall  which we added to our service suite in september  is our automated appointment reminder system that allows patients to either confirm the appointment or request rescheduling 
we have now combined remindercall with other automated patient messaging services  live operator services  and a patient web portal in the first edition of our athenacommunicator services suite that we beta launched in and expect to offer commercially in the first half of we refer to athenacollector as our revenue cycle management service  athenaclinicals as our clinical cycle management service  and athenacommunicator as our patient cycle management service 
as a complement to these services  our newest offering  anodyne analytics  is a web based  software as a service business intelligence platform that organizes and displays detailed and insightful practice performance data for decision makers at our client practices 
our services are designed to help our clients achieve faster reimbursement from payers  reduce error rates  increase collections  lower operating costs  improve operational workflow controls  improve patient satisfaction and compliance  and more efficiently manage clinical and billing information 
in the last six years  we have primarily focused on developing our proprietary internet based software application and integrated service operations to expand our client base 
in  we formed a subsidiary in india to complement our us based software development activities and to work closely with our business partners in india 
in september  we completed our first acquisition  purchasing the assets of crest line technologies  llc dba medicalmessaging 
net  a privately held company that developed remindercall and associated services 
we continued this expansion of our offerings in october with our acquisition of our new operating subsidiary  anodyne health partners  inc anodyne  a privately held company that developed the anodyne analytics service 
in  we generated revenue of million from the sale of our services  compared to million in as of december   there were more than  medical providers  including more than  physicians  using our services across states and the district of columbia and medical specialties 
market opportunity we believe that the market opportunity for our services is  in large part  currently driven by physician practice collections in the united states 
according to the us centers for medicare and medicaid services  physician and clinical services spending increased since by an average of per year to billion in growth in managed care has increased the complexity of physician practice reimbursement 
managed care plans typically create reimbursement structures with greater complexity than previous methods  placing greater responsibility on the physician practice to capture and provide appropriate data to obtain payments 
also  despite substantial consolidation in the number of managed care organizations over the last decade  many of the legacy information technology platforms used to manage the plans operated by these companies have remained in place 
as a result of this increasing complexity  physician practices must keep track of multiple plan designs and processing requirements to ensure appropriate payment for services rendered 
physician practice based billing activities that are required to ensure appropriate payment for services rendered have increased in number and complexity for the following reasons diversity of health benefit plan design 
health insurers have introduced a wide range of benefit structures  many of which are customized to unique goals of particular employer groups 
this has resulted in an increase in rules regarding who is eligible for healthcare services  what healthcare services are eligible for reimbursement  and who is responsible for payment for healthcare services delivered 
dynamic nature of health benefit plan design 
health insurers continuously update their reimbursement rules based on ongoing monitoring of consumption patterns  in response to new medical products and procedures  and to address changing employer demands 
as these changes are made frequently throughout the year and are frequently specific to each individual health plan  physician practices need 
table of contents to be continually aware of this dynamic element of the reimbursement cycle as it could impact overall reimbursement and specific workflows 
proliferation of new payment models 
new health benefit plans and reimbursement structures have considerably modified the ways in which physician practices are paid 
for example  there is an increasing trend toward consumer driven health plans  or cdhps  that require a far greater portion of fees to be paid by the consumer  typically until a pre specified threshold is achieved 
care based initiatives  including pay for performance  or pp programs  which provide reimbursement incentives centered around capture and submission of specified clinical information  have dramatically increased the administrative and clinical documentation burden of the physician practice 
changes in the regulatory environment 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  required changes in the way private health information is handled  mandated new data formats for the health insurance industry  and created new security standards 
among the changes introduced by hipaa  physicians have been required to adopt national provider identifiers  and this has affected physician practice billing and collection workflow requirements 
in addition to administering typical business functions  physician practices must invest significant time and resources in activities that are required to secure reimbursement from patients or third party payers and process inbound and outbound communications related to physician orders to laboratories and pharmacies 
in order to process these communications  physician practices often manipulate locally or remotely installed software  execute paper based and fax based communications to and from payers  and conduct telephone based discussions with payers and intermediaries to resolve unpaid claims or to inquire about the status of transactions 
the established model currently  the majority of physician practices bill for their services in one of three ways purchasing  installing  and operating locally installed practice management software  paying for use of remotely installed on demand practice management software  or hiring a third party billing service to collect billing related information and input the information into a software system maintained by the service 
in terms of medical record management  the majority of physician practices rely on paper based systems or use locally or remotely installed ehr software to generate electronic medical record information 
however  these software systems do not eliminate paper based transactions and information exchanges with intermediaries such as labs  pharmacies  and hospitals 
physician practices are still responsible for inputting all medical record information into the software  as these systems are not automatically linked to those of the intermediaries 
in many instances  the solutions that are installed at a physician practice or a remote location are operated by that practice s administrative staff 
as the complexity and number of health benefit plan payer rules has increased  the ability of locally or remotely installed software solutions to keep up with new and revised payer rules has lagged behind this trend  leading to higher levels of unpaid claims  prolonged billing cycles  increased clinical inefficiencies  and missed opportunities for reimbursements for participation in pp programs 
while locally or remotely installed software has been shown to provide improvement in physician practice efficiency and collections relative to paper based systems  we believe that such standalone software is not suited for today s dynamic and increasingly complex healthcare system 
despite advances in practice management and ehr software to address the administrative needs of physician practices  the billing  collections  and medical record management functions remain expensive  inefficient  and challenging for many physician practice groups 
we believe that established locally or remotely installed physician practice management and ehr software has generally suffered from the following challenges software is static and isolated 
payer rules change continuously  and the systems used to seek reimbursement require constant updating to remain accurate 
if it is not linked to a centrally hosted  continuously updated knowledge base of payer rules  software typically cannot reflect real time changes based upon health benefit plan specific requirements 
additionally  since most software vendors are not in the business of processing claims  they are often unaware of the creation of new payer rules and 
table of contents changes to existing payer rules 
as a result  physician practices typically have the responsibility to navigate this complex and dynamic reimbursement system in order to submit accurate and complete claims 
we believe that their inability to keep current on these rule changes is the single largest factor leading to claims denials and diverting time and resources away from revenue and clinical cycle workflow 
software requires reliance on physician practice personnel 
physician practices have difficulty managing the increased complexity of billing  collections  and medical record management because they lack the necessary infrastructure and suffer from significant staff turnover rates 
despite attempts to automate workflow  many software solutions still require that a number of healthcare supply chain interactions be executed manually via paper  fax  or phone 
these manual interactions include insurance product monitoring  insurance eligibility  claims submission  claims tracking  remittance posting  denials management  payment processing  formatting of lab requisitions  submitting of lab requisitions  and monitoring and classification of all inbound faxes 
these tasks are prone to human error  are inefficient  and generally require the accumulation of rules and claims processing knowledge by the individuals involved 
high employee turnover in physician practices leads to critical reimbursement and transaction processing knowledge being lost 
software vendors are not paid on results 
most established practice management and ehr software companies operate under a business model that does not directly incentivize them to improve their clients financial and operational results 
the established software business model involves a substantial upfront license payment in addition to ongoing maintenance fees 
while the goal of practice management and ehr software is to improve reimbursement and clinical efficiency  the responsibility for realizing these efficiencies still largely rests on physician practices administrative and clinical staff 
we believe that the use of traditional outsourced back office service providers does not adequately compensate for the deficiencies of the locally or remotely installed software model 
such service providers generally rely on third party software that suffers from the same deficiencies that physicians experience when they perform their own back office processing operations 
the software often is not connected to payer rules that can be enforced in real time by office staff throughout the patient workflow 
in addition  these service providers typically operate discrete databases and sometimes utilize separate processes for each client they serve  which affords limited advantages of scale  thereby conferring limited cost advantages to physician practices 
without either control over the software application or an integrated rules database  outsourced service providers cannot offer physicians the benefits of our internet based business service model 
the payer universe is dynamic and continuously growing in complexity as rules are changed and new rules are added  making it extremely difficult for physician practices  and even payers  to effectively manage the reimbursement rules landscape 
in addition  clinical data management and reporting is also beginning to impact reimbursement for physician practices 
while locally or remotely installed software has struggled to meet these challenges  the internet has developed in the broader economy into a reliable and efficient medium that opens the door to entirely new ways of performing business functions 
the internet is ideally suited to centralization of the large scale research needed to stay current with payer rules and to the instantaneous dissemination of this information 
the internet also allows real time consolidation and centralized execution of administrative work across many medical practice locations 
as a result  the health care industry is well suited to benefit from the efficiency and effectiveness of the internet as a delivery platform 
our solution the dynamic and increasingly complex healthcare market requires an integrated solution to manage the reimbursement and clinical landscape effectively 
we believe that we are the first company to integrate web based software  a continually updated database of payer rules  back office service operations  and automated and live patient communication services into a single internet based business service for physician practices 

table of contents we seek to deliver these services at each critical step in the revenue and clinical cycle workflow through a combination of software  knowledge  and work software 
athenanet  our proprietary web based practice management and ehr application  is a workflow management tool used to properly handle billing  collections  patient communications  and medical record management related functions 
all users across our client base simultaneously use the same version of our software application  which connects them to our continually updated database of payer rules and to our services team 
knowledge 
athenarules  our proprietary database of payer reimbursement process rules  enforces physician practice workflow requirements and is continually updated with payer specific coding and documentation information 
this knowledge continues to grow as a result of our years of experience managing back office service operations for hundreds of physician practices  including processing medical claims with tens of thousands of health benefit packages 
athenarules is also designed to access medication formularies  identify potential medication errors such as drug to drug interactions or allergy reactions  and identify the specific clinical activities that are required to comply with pp programs 
work 
the athenahealth service operations  consisting of approximately people  interact with clients at all key steps of the revenue and clinical cycle workflow 
these operations include setting up medical providers for billing  checking the eligibility of scheduled patients electronically  submitting electronic and paper based claims to payers directly or through intermediaries  processing clinical orders  receiving and processing checks and remittance information from payers  documenting the result of payers responses  and evaluating and resubmitting claims denials 
we are economically aligned with our physician practice clients because payment for our services in most cases is dependent on the results our services achieve for our clients 
the positive results of our approach are seen in the significant growth in the number of clients serviced  collections under management  and overall revenue in each of the preceding nine years 
key advantages of our solution include low total cost of the athenahealth solutions 
the cost of our services includes a modest upfront expenditure for implementation and training  with ongoing monthly service fees typically based on a percentage of client collections 
this approach differs from the established model that requires upfront investments in software  hardware  implementation service and support  and additional information technology staff 
we continually update our web based software and add or revise over rules on average each month in our shared payer knowledge base  which enables our clients to use these new features with minimal disruption and no incremental cost 
once implemented  our clients access our services by using an internet connection and a web browser 
we believe that our services based model provides advantages to our clients based on the elimination of future upgrade  training  and extra follow up costs associated with the established model 
comprehensive payer rules engine that is continuously expanded and updated 
we believe that we have the largest and most comprehensive continually updated database of payer reimbursement process rules in the united states 
we collect health benefit plan specific processing information so that the medical office workflow and the work of our service operations can be tailored to the requirements of each health benefit plan 
real time error alerts automatically triggered by our rules engine enable our clients in many cases to catch billing related errors immediately at the beginning of the reimbursement cycle  fix these errors quickly  and generate medical claims that achieve high first pass success rates 
payer rules change frequently and are not commonly published by payers  therefore most rules must be learned from experience 
we have full time staff focused on finding  researching  documenting  and implementing new rules  enabling our solution to consistently deliver quantifiably improved financial results for our clients 
additionally  we discover and implement even more new rules as new clients connect to our rules engine and expose our staff to new reimbursement scenarios 
our other clients 
table of contents benefit from the addition of these new rules  and this continuous updating increases our value proposition benefiting both current and future clients 
real time workflow and process optimization result in improved financial and operational outcomes 
our solution enables real time communications between the physician practice s staff and our service operations staff throughout the patient encounter and billing processes 
we believe that this online interaction is vital for delivering the financial and operational performance our clients enjoy 
the monitoring and managing of physician practice workflows allows us to stay close to client needs and constantly upgrade our offerings in order to improve the effectiveness of our overall service 
these elements allow us to identify and influence critical practice workflow steps to maximize billing performance and deliver improved financial and operational outcomes for our clients 
critical mass and access to superior scale and capabilities 
we have taken physician back office tasks that would otherwise be performed on a local or regional basis and have brought them together on a single national platform 
our platform was designed and constructed to enable us to assume responsibility for the completion of automated and manual tasks in the revenue and clinical workflow cycles  while providing critical tools and knowledge to effectively assist clients in completing those tasks that must be done on site in the physician practice 
as a result of our centralized infrastructure  we can apply a broad array of resources from athenahealth  our clients  and our off shore partners to address the myriad of discrete tasks within the revenue and clinical workflow cycles in a cost effective manner 
this approach allows us to deliver services and performance superior to what any particular physician practice could achieve on its own 
our strategy our mission is to be the most trusted business service to medical groups 
key elements of our strategy include remaining intensely focused on our clients success 
our business model aligns our goals with our clients goals and provides an incentive for us to improve the performance of our clients continually 
we believe that this approach enables us to maintain client loyalty  enhance our reputation  and improve the quality of our solutions 
maintaining and growing our payer rules database 
our rules engine development work is designed to increase the percentage of transactions that are successfully executed on the first attempt and to reduce the time to resolution after claims or other transactions are submitted 
we continue to develop our centralized payer reimbursement process rules database  athenarules  by learning from experience gained across our national network of clients 
attracting new clients 
we expect to continue with current and expanded sales and marketing efforts to address our market opportunity by aggressively seeking new clients 
we believe that our internet based business services provide significant value for physician practices of any size 
with more than  practicing physicians in the united states  we estimate that our client base currently represents less than three percent of the us addressable market for revenue cycle management and clinical cycle management services 
increasing revenue per client by adding new service offerings 
we expanded our offerings in september by acquiring the assets of crest line technologies  llc  which provided our remindercall service  and in october by acquiring anodyne  which developed our anodyne analytics service 
in  we beta launched our athenacommunicator services suite that combined remindercall with other automated patient messaging services  live operator services  and a patient web portal  and we expect to offer athenacommunicator commercially in the first half of we continue to explore additional services to address other administrative tasks within physician practices 
expanding operating margins by reducing the costs of providing our services 
we believe that we can increase our operating margins as we increase the scalability of our service operations 
our integrated operations enable us to deploy efficient and effective resources in providing our services

this web based software as a service platform organizes and analyzes billing and claims based data  allowing physician practices to quickly and easily visualize that data through a wide array of business performance metrics 
these metrics can be provided either as broad  practice wide summaries or as discrete  highly specific analyses based on complex user defined requests 
in the future  we plan to further leverage the efficiencies currently provided by athenanet with the additional detail and analysis offered by anodyne analytics and the anodyne intelligence platform 
sales and marketing we have developed a sales and marketing capability aimed at expanding our network of physician clients and expect to expand these efforts in the future 
we have a significant direct sales effort  which we augment through our indirect channel relationships 
direct sales as of december   we employed a direct sales and sales support force of employees 
of these employees  were sales professionals 
due to of our ongoing service relationship with clients  we conduct a consultative sales process 
this process includes understanding the needs of prospective clients  developing service proposals  and negotiating contracts to enable the commencement of services 
our sales team can be divided into three groups the enterprise team who are dedicated to physician practices with or more physicians  the group team who are dedicated to physician practices with four to physicians  and the small group team who are dedicated to physician practices with one to three physicians 
this sales force includes quota carrying sales representatives  five members of the enterprise team  members of the group team  and members of the small group team 
our sales force is supported by personnel in our marketing organization who provide specialized support for promotional and selling efforts 
channel partners in addition to our employed sales force  we maintain business relationships with individuals and organizations that promote or support our sales or services within specific industries or geographic regions  which we refer to as channels 
we refer to these individuals and organizations as our channel partners 
in most cases  these relationships are generally agreements that compensate channel partners for providing us sales lead information that results in sales 
these channel partners generally do not make sales but instead provide us with leads that we use to develop new business through our direct sales force 
other channel relationships permit third parties to act as value added resellers or as independent sales representatives 
in some instances  the channel relationship involves endorsement or promotion of our services by these third parties 
in  channel based leads were associated with approximately half of our new business 
our channel relationships include state medical societies  healthcare information technology product companies  healthcare product distribution companies  and consulting firms 
examples of these types of channel relationships include the ohio state medical society  eclipsys corporation  and worldmed shared services  inc d b a pss world medical shares services  inc  or pss 
in may  we entered into a marketing and sales agreement with pss for the marketing and sale of athenaclinicals and athenacollector 
the agreement has an initial term of three years and may be terminated by either party for cause or convenience 
the agreement shall automatically renew after the initial term for 
table of contents successive one year periods unless athenahealth or pss gives notice of termination no later than sixty days prior to expiration of the then current term 
under the terms of the agreement  we will pay pss sales commissions based upon the estimated contract value of orders placed with pss  which will be adjusted months after the date the service begins for each client  in order to reflect actual revenue received by us from clients 
subsequent commissions will be based upon a specified percentage of actual revenue generated from orders placed with pss 
we funded million toward the establishment of an incentive plan for the pss sales representatives during the first twelve months of the agreement and are responsible for co sponsoring training sessions and conducting on line education for pss sales representatives 
under the terms of the agreement  athenahealth s revenue cycle services and clinical cycle services are now the exclusive revenue and clinical cycle solutions sold by pss  except that pss may sell clinical cycle services not based on an application service provider model 
additionally  the terms of the agreement prohibit us from entering into a similar agreement with any business that has  as its primary source of revenue  revenue from the business of distributing medical and surgical supplies to the physician ambulatory care market in the united states 
none of our existing channel relationships are affected by our exclusive arrangement with pss  and while our agreement with pss precludes us from entering into similar arrangements with other distributors of medical and surgical supplies to the physician ambulatory care market in the united states  we believe that pss is of sufficient size so as to offer us a compelling opportunity to market our services to prospective clients that would otherwise be difficult for us to reach 
according to pss  they are the largest provider of medical and surgical supplies to the physician market in the united states  with a sales force consisting of more than sales consultants who distribute medical supplies and equipment to more than  offices in all states 
marketing initiatives since our service model is new to most physicians  our marketing and sales objectives are designed to increase awareness of our company  establish the benefits of our service model  and build credibility with prospective clients so that they will view our company as a trustworthy long term service provider 
to execute on this strategy  we have designed and implemented specific activities and programs aimed at converting leads to new clients 
our marketing initiatives are generally targeted towards specific segments of the physician practice market 
these marketing programs primarily consist of traditional print advertising  sponsoring pay per click search advertising and other internet focused awareness building efforts such as social media  online videos  webinars  and destination websites covering compliance and other issues of interest to physician practices  engaging in public relations activities aimed at generating media coverage  participating in industry focused trade shows  disseminating targeted mail  e mail  and phone calls to physician practices  conducting informational meetings such as strategic retreats with targeted potential clients  and dinner seminar series 
in june  we introduced our annual payerview rankings in order to provide an industry unique framework to systematically address what we believe is administrative complexity existing between payers and providers 
payerview is designed to look at payers performance based on a number of categories  which combine to provide an overall ranking aimed at quantifying the ease of doing business with the payer 
all data used for the rankings come from actual claims performance data of our clients and depict our experience in dealing with individual payers across the nation 
the rankings include national payers that meet a minimum yearly threshold of  charge lines of data and regional payers that meet a minimum yearly threshold of  charge lines

we refer to this as a horizontal scaling architecture  which means that hardware to support new clients is added alongside existing clients hardware and does not directly affect existing clients 
we devote significant resources to innovation 
we execute monthly releases of new software functionality to our clients each year 
our software development life cycle methodology ensures that each software release is properly designed  built  tested  and rolled out 
our clients all operate on the same version of our software  although some rules are designed to take effect only locally for particular clients 
our software development activities involve approximately technologists employed by us in the united states as of december  we complement this team s work with software development services from third party technology development providers in huntsville  alabama and pune  india  and with our own direct employees at our development centers operated through our subsidiaries located in alpharetta  georgia  and chennai  india 
in addition to our core software development activities  we dedicate full time staff to our ongoing development and maintenance of the athenarules database 
on average  over rules are added or revised in our rules engine each month 
we also employ process program management and product management personnel  who work continually on improvements to our service operations processes and our service design  respectively 
once our clients are live on our service  we collaborate with them to generate business results 
we employed approximately people in our service operations dedicated to providing these services to our clients as of december  these employees assist our clients at each critical step in the revenue cycle and clinical cycle workflow process and provide services that include insurance benefits packaging  insurance eligibility confirmation  claims submission  claims tracking  remittance posting  denials management  payment processing  formatting of lab requisitions  submission of lab requisitions  and monitoring and classification of all inbound faxes 
additionally  we use third parties for data entry  data matching  data characterization  and outbound telephone services 
currently  we have contracted for these services with international business machines corporation and vision business process solutions inc  a subsidiary of dell  inc 
formerly perot systems corporation  to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in india and the philippines to support our client service operations 
these services are generally commercially available at comparable rates from other service providers 
during  athenahealth posted approximately billion in physician collections  processed over million medical claims  handled approximately million charge postings  and sorted over million pages of paper  which amounted to approximately  pounds of mail 

table of contents we depend on satisfied clients to succeed 
our client contracts require minimum commitments by us on a range of tasks  including claims submission  payment posting  claims tracking  and claims denial management 
we also commit to our clients that athenanet is accessible of the time  excluding scheduled maintenance windows 
each quarter  our management conducts a survey of clients to identify client concerns and track progress against client satisfaction objectives 
in our most recent survey for athenacollector  of the respondents reported that they would recommend our services to a trusted friend or colleague 
in addition to the services described above  we also provide client support services 
there are several client service support activities that take place on a regular basis  including the following client support by our client services center that is designed to address client questions and concerns rapidly  whether those questions and concerns are registered via a phone call or via an online support case through our customized use of customer relationship management technology  account performance and issue resolution activities performed by the account management organization that are designed to address open issues and focus clients on the financial results of the co sourcing relationship  these activities are intended to aid in client retention  determine appropriate adjustments to service pricing at renewal dates  and provide incremental services when appropriate  and relationship management by regional leaders of the client services organization to ensure that decision makers at client practices are satisfied and that regional performance is managed proactively with regard to client satisfaction  client margins  client retention  renewal pricing  and added services 
the increased burden on patients to pay for a larger percentage of their healthcare services  together with the need for providers to have the ability to determine this patient payment responsibility at the time of service  has led some payers to develop the capability to accept and process claims in real time 
under such a real time adjudication  or rta  system  payers notify physicians immediately upon receipt of billing information if third party claims are accepted or rejected  the amount that will be paid by the payer  and the amount that the patient may owe under the particular health plan involved 
this capability is frequently referred to within the industry as real time adjudication because it avoids the processing time that adjudication of claims by payers has historically involved 
taking advantage of this payer capability  we have designed a platform for transacting with payer rta systems that is payer neutral and designed to integrate the various payer rta processes so that our clients experience the same workflow regardless of payer 
using this platform  we have collaborated with two major payers  humana and united healthcare  to process rta transactions with their systems 
competition we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  intense competition from a number of companies 
our primary competition is the use of locally installed software to manage revenue and clinical cycle workflow within the physician s office 
other nationwide competitors have begun introducing services that they refer to as on demand or software as a service models  under which software is centrally hosted and services are provided from central locations 
software and service companies that sell practice management and ehr software and medical billing and collection services include ge healthcare  sage software healthcare  inc  allscripts misys healthcare solutions  inc  siemens medical solutions usa  inc  eclinical works  llc  and quality systems  inc as a service company that provides revenue cycle services  we also compete against large billing companies such as mckesson corp  ingenix  a division of united healthcare  inc  and regional billing companies 
the principal competitive factors in our industry include ability to quickly adapt to increasing complexity of the healthcare reimbursement system  size and scope of payer rules knowledge  ease of use and rates of user adoption  product functionality and scope of services  
table of contents scope of network connections to support electronic data interactions  performance  security  scalability  and reliability of service  sale and marketing capabilities of the vendor  and financial stability of the vendor 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors 
however  many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technological  and other resources and name recognition than we do  as well as more established distribution networks and relationships with healthcare providers 
as a result  many of these companies may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and standards and changes in customer requirements 
these companies may be able to invest more resources than we can in research and development  strategic acquisitions  sales and marketing  and patent prosecution and litigation and to finance capital equipment acquisitions for their customers 
government regulation although we generally do not contract with us state or local government entities  the services that we provide are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws and regulations  including regulation by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  of the us department of health and human services  as well as additional regulation 
government regulation of health information hipaa privacy and security rules 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  as amended  and the regulations that have been issued under it collectively  hipaa contain substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information 
these are embodied in the privacy rule and security rule portions of hipaa 
the hipaa privacy rule prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual s protected health information unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the privacy rule 
the privacy rule imposes a complex system of requirements on covered entities for complying with this basic standard 
under the hipaa security rule  covered entities must establish administrative  physical  and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality  integrity  and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf 
the hipaa privacy and security rules apply directly to covered entities  such as healthcare providers who engage in hipaa defined standard electronic transactions  health plans  and healthcare clearinghouses 
because we translate electronic transactions to and from the hipaa prescribed electronic forms and other forms  we are considered a clearinghouse  and as such are a covered entity 
in addition  our clients are also covered entities 
in order to provide clients with services that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information  the hipaa privacy and security rules require us to enter into business associate agreements with our clients 
such agreements must  among other things  provide adequate written assurances as to how we will use and disclose the protected health information  that we will implement reasonable administrative  physical  and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse  that we will enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information  that we will report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information  and that we will assist the client in question with certain of its duties under the privacy rule 
hipaa transaction requirements 
in addition to the privacy and security rules  hipaa also requires that certain electronic transactions related to health care billing be conducted using prescribed electronic formats 
for example  claims for reimbursement that are transmitted electronically to payers must comply with 
table of contents specific formatting standards  and these standards apply whether the payer is a government or a private entity 
as a covered entity subject to hipaa  we must meet these requirements  and moreover  we must structure and provide our services in a way that supports our clients hipaa compliance obligations 
hitech act 
the hitech act  which became law in february  and the regulations issued and to be issued under it have provided and are expected to provide  among other things  clarification of certain aspects of both the privacy and security rules  expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the security rule  and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with hipaa 
as these additional requirements are adopted  we will be required to comply with them 
state laws 
in addition to the hipaa privacy and security rules and the requirements imposed by the hitech act  most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information  and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area  including privacy safeguards  security standards  and data security breach notification requirements 
such state laws  if more stringent than hipaa and hitech act requirements  are not preempted by the federal requirements  and we must comply with them 
for example  the massachusetts office of consumer affairs and business regulations issued final data security regulations  which became effective in march and establish minimum standards for protecting and storing personal information about massachusetts residents contained in paper or electronic format 
red flag rules 
starting june   medical practices that act as creditors to their patients will need to comply with new federal trade commission rules promulgated under the fair and accurate credit transactions act of that are aimed at reducing the risk of identity theft 
these rules require creditors to adopt policies and procedures that identify patterns  practices  or activities that indicate possible identity theft called red flags  detect those red flags  and respond appropriately to those red flags to prevent or mitigate any theft 
the rules also require creditors to update their policies and procedures on a regular basis 
because most practices treat their patients without receiving full payment at the time of service  our clients are generally considered creditors for purposes of these rules and are required to comply with them 
although we are not directly subject to these rules since we do not extend credit to customers we do handle patient data that  if improperly disclosed  could be used in identity theft 
because the red flag rules were originally slated to take effect in november  we have been assisting in our clients efforts to the extent necessary to implement appropriate procedures for some time and plan on continuing to do so 
government regulation of reimbursement our clients are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies  including those that administer the medicare and medicaid programs 
accordingly  our clients are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in  and limitations on  the government healthcare programs and changes in reimbursement policies  processes  and payment rates 
during recent years  there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs  including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to physicians and other healthcare providers and adjustments that have affected the complexity of our work 
for example  medicare reimbursement was  for a period of time in  reduced with respect to portions of the physician payment fee schedule 
the federal government subsequently rescinded reduction and decided to pay physicians the amount of the reduction that had been applied to claims already processed under the reduced payment fee schedule 
to collect these payments for our clients  we re submitted claims that had previously been processed 
this process required substantial unanticipated processing work by us  and the additional payments for re submitted claims were sometimes very small 
it is possible that the federal or state governments will implement future reductions  increases  or changes in reimbursement under government programs that adversely affect our client base or our cost of providing our services 
any such changes could adversely affect our own financial condition by reducing the reimbursement rates of our clients or by increasing our cost of serving clients 

table of contents fraud and abuse a number of federal and state laws  loosely referred to as fraud and abuse laws  are used to prosecute healthcare providers  physicians  and others that make  offer  seek  or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state healthcare program and  in some instances  any private program 
given the breadth of these laws and regulations  they are potentially applicable to our business  the transactions that we undertake on behalf of our clients  and the financial arrangements through which we market  sell  and distribute our services 
these laws and regulations include anti kickback laws 
there are numerous federal and state laws that govern patient referrals  physician financial relationships  and inducements to healthcare providers and patients 
the federal healthcare programs anti kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering  paying  soliciting  or receiving anything of value  directly or indirectly  for the referral of patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing  purchasing  ordering  or arranging for or recommending the lease  purchase  or order of any item  good  facility  or service covered by these programs 
courts have construed this anti kickback law to mean that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of one of the arrangements is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business  regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement 
there are several limited exclusions known as safe harbors that may protect some arrangements from enforcement penalties 
these safe harbors have very limited application 
penalties for federal anti kickback violations are severe  and include imprisonment  criminal fines  civil money penalties with triple damages  and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs 
many states have similar anti kickback laws  some of which are not limited to items or services for which payment is made by a government healthcare program 
false or fraudulent claim laws 
there are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with the submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement 
in some cases  these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment  for example  by systematic over treatment or duplicate billing for the same services to collect increased or duplicate payments 
these laws and regulations may change rapidly  and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business 
for example  one federal false claim law forbids knowing submission to government programs of false claims for reimbursement for medical items or services 
under this law  knowledge may consist of willful ignorance or reckless disregard of falsity 
how these concepts apply to services such as ours that rely substantially on automated processes has not been well defined in the regulations or relevant case law 
as a result  our errors with respect to the formatting  preparation  or transmission of such claims and any mishandling by us of claims information that is supplied by our clients or other third parties may be determined to  or may be alleged to  involve willful ignorance or reckless disregard of any falsity that is later determined to exist 
in most cases where we are permitted to do so  we charge our clients a percentage of the collections that they receive as a result of our services 
to the extent that liability under fraud and abuse laws and regulations requires intent  it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services has stated that it is concerned that percentage based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices 
stark law and similar state laws 
the ethics in patient referrals act  known as the stark law  prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and healthcare entities 
physicians are prohibited from referring patients for certain designated health services reimbursed under federally funded programs to entities with which they or their immediate family members have a financial relationship or an ownership interest  unless such referrals fall within a specific exception 
violations of the statute can result in civil monetary penalties and or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
furthermore  reimbursement claims for care rendered under forbidden referrals may be deemed false or fraudulent  resulting in liability under other fraud and abuse laws 
laws in many states similarly forbid billing based on referrals between individuals and or entities that have various financial  ownership  or other business relationships 
these laws vary widely from state to state 

table of contents corporate practice of medicine laws  fee splitting laws  and anti assignment laws in many states  there are laws that forbid non licensed practitioners from practicing medicine  prevent corporations from being licensed as practitioners  and forbid licensed medical practitioners from practicing medicine in partnership with non physicians  such as business corporations 
in some states  these prohibitions take the form of laws or regulations forbidding the splitting of physician fees with non physicians or others 
in some cases  these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges 
there are also federal and state laws that forbid or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government funded programs 
some of these laws limit the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and prevent such companies from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges 
in particular  the medicare program specifically requires that billing agents who receive medicare payments on behalf of medical care providers must meet the following requirements the agent must receive the payment under an agreement between the provider and the agent  the agent s compensation may not be related in any way to the dollar amount billed or collected  the agent s compensation may not depend upon the actual collection of payment  the agent must act under payment disposition instructions  which the provider may modify or revoke at any time  and in receiving the payment  the agent must act only on behalf of the provider  except insofar as the agent uses part of that payment to compensate the agent for the agent s billing and collection services 
medicaid regulations similarly provide that payments may be received by billing agents in the name of their clients without violating anti assignment requirements if payment to the agent is related to the cost of the billing service  not related on a percentage basis to the amount billed or collected  and not dependent on collection of payment 
electronic prescribing laws states have differing prescription format and signature requirements 
many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate the methods of e commerce now being developed 
however  due in part to recent industry initiatives  federal law and the laws of all states now permit the electronic transmission of prescription orders 
in addition  on november   the department of health and human services published its final e prescribing and the prescription drug program regulations  referred to below as the e prescribing regulations 
these regulations are required by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of mma and became effective beginning on january  the e prescribing regulations consist of detailed standards and requirements  in addition to the hipaa standards discussed previously  for prescription and other information transmitted electronically in connection with a drug benefit covered by the mma s prescription drug benefit 
these standards cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information 
the standards apply to prescription drug plans participating in the mma s prescription drug benefit 
aspects of our services are affected by such regulation  as our clients need to comply with these requirements 
anti tampering laws for certain prescriptions that cannot or may not be transmitted electronically from physician to pharmacy  both federal and state laws require that the written forms used exhibit anti tampering features 
for example  the us troop readiness  veterans care  katrina recovery  and iraq accountability appropriations act of has since april required that most prescriptions covered by medicaid must demonstrate security features that prevent copying  erasing  or counterfeiting of the written form 
because our clients will  on 
table of contents occasion  need to use printed forms  we must take these laws into consideration for purposes of the prescription functions of our athenaclinicals service 
electronic health records certification requirements the federal office of the national coordinator for health information technology  or onchit  is responsible for promoting the use of interoperable electronic health records and systems 
onchit has introduced a strategic framework and has awarded contracts to advance a national health information network and interoperable ehrs 
one project within this framework is a voluntary private sector based certification commission  cchit  that certifies electronic health record systems as meeting minimum functional and interoperability requirements 
our clinical application functionality is certified by cchit under its criteria 
due to the possible incorporation of cchit s criteria into the meaningful use standards under the hitech act  such certification may become a de facto requirement for selling clinical systems in the future  however  cchit s certification requirement may change substantially 
while we believe our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability  we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements 
united states food and drug administration the fda has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices and a proposed rule for reclassification of medical device data systems under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  as amended  or fdca 
if our computer software functionality is a medical device under the policy or a medical device data system under the rule  we could be subject to the fda requirements discussed below 
although it is not possible to anticipate the final form of the fda s policy or final rule with regard to computer software  we expect that the fda is likely to become increasingly active in regulating computer software intended for use in healthcare settings regardless of whether the draft policy or proposed rule is finalized or changed 
medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the fda under the fdca 
under the fdca  medical devices include any instrument  apparatus  machine  contrivance  or other similar or related article that is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure  mitigation  treatment  or prevention of disease 
fda regulations govern  among other things  product development  testing  manufacture  packaging  labeling  storage  clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  sales and distribution  and import and export 
fda requirements with respect to devices that are determined to pose lesser risk to the public include establishment registration and device listing with the fda  the quality system regulation  or qsr  which requires manufacturers  including third party or contract manufacturers  to follow stringent design  testing  control  documentation  and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of manufacturing  labeling regulations and fda prohibitions against the advertising and promotion of products for uncleared  unapproved off label uses and other requirements related to advertising and promotional activities  medical device reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur  corrections and removal reporting regulations  which require that manufacturers report to the fda any field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the fdca that may present a risk to health  and post market surveillance regulations  which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device 
non compliance with applicable fda requirements can result in  among other things  public warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  
table of contents failure of the fda to grant marketing approvals  withdrawal of marketing approvals  a recommendation by the fda to disallow us from entering into government contracts  and criminal prosecutions 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement  or refund of the cost of any device 
foreign regulations our subsidiary in chennai  india  is subject to additional regulations by the government of india  as well as its regional subdivisions 
these regulations include indian federal and local corporation requirements  restrictions on exchange of funds  employment related laws  and qualification for tax status and tax incentives 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  copyright  and trade secret laws in the united states as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology  databases  and our brand 
despite these reliances  we believe the following factors are more essential to establishing and maintaining a competitive advantage the statistical and technological skills of our service operations and research and development teams  the healthcare domain expertise and payer rules knowledge of our service operations and research and development teams  the real time connectivity of our solutions  the continued expansion of our proprietary rules engine  and a continued focus on the improved financial results of our clients 
our first patent application described and documented our unique patient workflow process  including the athenanet rules engine  which applies proprietary rules to practice and payer inputs on a live  ongoing basis to produce cleaner healthcare claims  which can be adjudicated more quickly and efficiently 
this patent application was granted in november and expires in december we have filed seven subsequent patent applications and two provisional patent applications that describe and document other unique aspects of our functionality and workflow processes during calendar years through and are currently pending before the united states patent and trademark office 
we also acquired one patent application each in connection with the acquisitions of medicalmessaging 
net in september and anodyne in october we also rely on a combination of registered and unregistered service marks to protect our brands 
athenahealth  athenanet  and the athenahealth logo are registered service marks of athenahealth 
in  we applied for the registration of athenaclinicals  athenacollector  athenacommunicator  and payerview as service marks of athenahealth  and we are currently corresponding with the examiner to resolve some technical issues 
additionally  athenaenterprise  athenarules  and remindercall are service marks of athenahealth  and in connection with the acquisition of anodyne we acquired anodyne analytics and anodyne intelligence platform as service marks 
we have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us 
in addition  we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non disclosure agreements 
our agreements with clients include confidentiality and non disclosure provisions 
employees as of december   we had  employees

item a 
risk factors 
our operating results and financial condition have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on a number of factors 
except for the historical information in this report  the matters contained in this report include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward looking statements made in this report and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
such factors  among others  may have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations  and financial condition 

table of contents risks related to our business our operating results have in the past and may continue to fluctuate significantly  and if we fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  our stock price and the value of your investment could decline substantially 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate  and if we fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
moreover  our stock price may be based on expectations of our future performance that may be unrealistic or that may not be met 
some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include the extent to which our services achieve or maintain market acceptance  our ability to introduce new services and enhancements to our existing services on a timely basis  new competitors and the introduction of enhanced products and services from new or existing competitors  the length of our contracting and implementation cycles  the financial condition of our current and potential clients  changes in client budgets and procurement policies  the amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities  technical difficulties or interruptions in our services  our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and maintain an adequate rate of expansion of our sales force  changes in the regulatory environment related to healthcare  regulatory compliance costs  the timing  size  and integration success of potential future acquisitions  and unforeseen legal expenses  including litigation and settlement costs 
many of these factors are not within our control  and the occurrence of one or more of them might cause our operating results to vary widely 
as such  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
a significant portion of our operating expense is relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based in part on expectations regarding future revenue 
accordingly  unexpected revenue shortfalls may decrease our gross margins and could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our future quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time 
we operate in a highly competitive industry  and if we are not able to compete effectively  our business and operating results will be harmed 
the provision by third parties of revenue cycle services to physician practices has historically been dominated by small service providers who offer highly individualized services and a high degree of specialized knowledge applicable in many cases to a limited medical specialty  a limited set of payers  or a limited geographical area 
we anticipate that the software  statistical  and database tools that are available to such service providers will continue to become more sophisticated and effective and that demand for our services could be adversely affected 

table of contents revenue cycle software for physician practices has historically been dominated by large  well financed and technologically sophisticated entities that have focused on software solutions 
some of these entities are now offering on demand services or a software as a service model under which software is centrally administered  and administrative services may be provided on a vendor basis 
the size  financial strength  and breadth of offerings of these entities is increasing as a result of continued consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries 
we expect large integrated technology companies to become more active in our markets  both through acquisition and internal investment 
as costs fall and technology improves  increased market saturation may change the competitive landscape in favor of competitors with greater scale than we possess 
some of our current large competitors  such as ge healthcare  sage software healthcare  inc  allscripts misys healthcare solutions  inc  quality systems  inc  siemens medical solutions usa  inc  and mckesson corp 
have greater name recognition  longer operating histories  and significantly greater resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards  or client requirements 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established  and may in the future establish  cooperative relationships with vendors of complementary products  technologies  or services to increase the availability of their products to the marketplace 
current or future competitors may consolidate to improve the breadth of their products  directly competing with our integrated offerings 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances may emerge that have greater market share  larger client bases  more widely adopted proprietary technologies  broader offerings  greater marketing expertise  greater financial resources  and larger sales forces than we have  which could put us at a competitive disadvantage 
further  in light of these advantages  even if our services are more effective than the product or service offerings of our competitors  current or potential clients might accept competitive products and services in lieu of purchasing our services 
increased competition is likely to result in pricing pressures  which could negatively impact our sales  profitability  or market share 
in addition to new niche vendors  who offer stand alone products and services  we face competition from existing enterprise vendors  including those currently focused on software solutions  which have information systems in place with clients in our target market 
these existing enterprise vendors may now  or in the future  offer or promise products or services with less functionality than our services  but that offer ease of integration with existing systems and that leverage existing vendor relationships 
the market for our services is relatively immature and volatile  and if it does not develop further or if it develops more slowly than we expect  the growth of our business will be harmed 
the market for internet based business services is still relatively new and narrowly based  and it is uncertain whether these services will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance 
our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of enterprises  large and small  to increase their use of on demand business services in general  and for their revenue and clinical cycles in particular 
many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses  and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to an on demand application service 
furthermore  some enterprises may be reluctant or unwilling to use on demand application services  because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with security capabilities  among other things  of the technology delivery model associated with these services 
if enterprises do not perceive the benefits of our services  then the market for these services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect  either of which would significantly adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  as a relatively new company in the healthcare business services market  we have limited insight into trends that may develop and affect our business 
we may make errors in predicting and reacting to relevant business trends  which could harm our business 
if any of these risks occur  it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
if we do not continue to innovate and provide services that are useful to users  we may not remain competitive  and our revenues and operating results could suffer 
our success depends on providing services that the medical community uses to improve business performance and quality of service to patients 
our competitors are constantly developing products and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our clients 
as a result  we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing services and introduce new 
table of contents high quality services that clients will want 
if we are unable to predict user preferences or industry changes  or if we are unable to modify our services on a timely basis  we may lose clients 
our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our clients  are not appropriately timed with market opportunity  or are not effectively brought to market 
as technology continues to develop  our competitors may be able to offer results that are  or that are perceived to be  substantially similar to or better than those generated by our services 
this may force us to compete on additional service attributes and to expend significant resources in order to remain competitive 
as a result of our variable sales and implementation cycles  we may be unable to recognize revenue to offset expenditures  which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations or otherwise harm our future operating results 
the sales cycle for our services can be variable  typically ranging from three to five months from initial contact to contract execution 
during the sales cycle  we expend time and resources  and we do not recognize any revenue to offset such expenditures 
our implementation cycle is also variable  typically ranging from three to five months from contract execution to completion of implementation 
some of our new client set up projects are complex and require a lengthy delay and significant implementation work 
each client s situation is different  and unanticipated difficulties and delays may arise as a result of failure by us or by the client to meet our respective implementation responsibilities 
in some cases  especially those involving larger clients  the sales cycle and the implementation cycle may exceed the typical ranges by substantial margins 
during the implementation cycle  we expend substantial time  effort  and financial resources implementing our services  but accounting principles do not allow us to recognize the resulting revenue until the service has been implemented  at which time we begin recognition of implementation revenue over an expected attribution period of the longer of the estimated expected customer life  currently twelve years  or the contract term 
this could harm our future operating results 
after a client contract is signed  we provide an implementation process for the client during which appropriate connections and registrations are established and checked  data is loaded into our athenanet system  data tables are set up  and practice personnel are given initial training 
the length and details of this implementation process vary widely from client to client 
typically  implementation of larger clients takes longer than implementation for smaller clients 
implementation for a given client may be cancelled 
our contracts typically provide that they can be terminated for any reason or for no reason in days 
despite the fact that we typically require a deposit in advance of implementation  some clients have cancelled before our services have been started 
in addition  implementation may be delayed or the target dates for completion may be extended into the future for a variety of reasons  including the needs and requirements of the client  delays with payer processing  and the volume and complexity of the implementations awaiting our work 
if implementation periods are extended  our provision of the revenue cycle or clinical cycle services upon which we realize most of our revenues will be delayed  and our financial condition may be adversely affected 
in addition  cancellation of any implementation after it has begun may involve loss to us of time  effort  and expenses invested in the cancelled implementation process and lost opportunity for implementing paying clients in that same period of time 
these factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  particularly in the near term and during any period in which our sales volume is relatively low 
as a result  in future quarters our operating results could fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  in which event our stock price would likely decrease 
if the revenue of our clients decreases  or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts  our revenue will decrease 
under most of our client contracts  we base our charges on a percentage of the revenue that the client realizes while using our services 
many factors may lead to decrease in client revenue  including interruption of client access to our system for any reason  our failure to provide services in a timely or high quality manner  
table of contents failure of our clients to adopt or maintain effective business practices  actions by third party payers of medical claims to reduce reimbursement  government regulations and government or other payer actions reducing or delaying reimbursement  and reduction of client revenue resulting from increased competition or other changes in the marketplace for physician services 
the current economic situation may give rise to several of these factors 
for example  patients who have lost health insurance coverage due to unemployment or who face increased deductibles imposed by financially struggling employers or insurers could reduce the number of visits those patients make to our physician clients 
patients without health insurance or with reduced coverage may also default on their payment obligations at a higher rate than patients with coverage 
added financial stress on our clients could lead to their acquisition or bankruptcy  which could cause the termination of some of our service relationships 
further  despite the cost benefits that we believe our services provide  prospective clients may wish to delay contract decisions due to implementation costs or be reluctant to make any material changes in their established business methods in the current economic climate 
with a reduction in tax revenue  state and federal government health care programs  including reimbursement programs such as medicaid  may be reduced or eliminated  which could negatively impact the payments that our clients receive 
also  although we currently estimate our expected customer life to be twelve years  this is only an estimate and there can be no assurance that our clients will elect to renew their contracts for this period of time 
our clients typically purchase one year contracts that  in most cases  may be terminated on days notice without cause 
if our clients revenue decreases for any of the above or other reasons  or if our clients cancel or elect not to renew their contracts  our revenue will decrease 
we may not see the benefits of  or have our services approved under  government programs initiated to counter the effects of the current economic situation or foster the adoption of certain health information technologies  which could reduce client demand  trigger certain guarantee obligations  and affect our access to the market 
although government programs have been initiated to counter the effects of the current economic situation and foster the adoption of certain health information technologies  we cannot assure you that we will receive any funds from  or have our services approved under  those programs 
for example  the hitech act has authorized approximately billion in expenditures to further adoption of electronic health records  and entities such as the massachusetts healthcare consortium have offered to subsidize such adoption  as permitted by recent changes in federal regulations 
while we believe that our service offerings will meet the requirements of the hitech act and other programs in order for our clients to qualify for additional reimbursement for implementing and using our services  there can be no certainty that any of the planned additional reimbursements  if made  will be made in regard to our services 
to the extent that we do not qualify for or participate in such subsidy programs  demand for our services may be reduced  which may result in decreased revenues  perhaps material decreases 
furthermore  we have offered certain existing and prospective clients a guarantee that they will receive medicare incentive reimbursement under the hitech act program year for meaningful use of our athenaclinicals ehr service 
if such reimbursements are delayed or not made because of a failure on our part  we could be obligated to credit up to six months of our ehr services fees for each client participating in our guarantee program 
in addition  if our services are not approved or included as a preferred solution under certain programs  our access to the market could be reduced 
for example  the health information technology extension program under the hitech act provides for or more regional centers that will assist local healthcare providers in selecting and using ehr products and services 
if any of our services are not approved  or not included in a list of preferred products and services  under one or more programs  demand for our services and our access to the market could be reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  including a material decrease in revenues and possibly market share 

table of contents if participants in our channel marketing and sales lead programs do not maintain appropriate relationships with current and potential clients  our sales accomplished with their help or data may be unwound and our payments to them may be deemed improper 
we maintain a series of relationships with third parties that we term channel relationships 
these relationships take different forms under different contractual language 
some relationships help us identify sales leads 
other relationships permit third parties to act as value added resellers or as independent sales representatives for our services 
in some cases  for example in the case of some membership organizations  these relationships involve endorsement of our services as well as other marketing activities 
in each of these cases  we require contractually that the third party disclose information to and or limit their relationships with potential purchasers of our services for regulatory compliance reasons 
if these third parties do not comply with these regulatory requirements or if our requirements are deemed insufficient  sales accomplished with the data or help that they have provided as well as the channel relationship themselves may not be enforceable  may be unwound  and may be deemed to violate relevant laws or regulations 
third parties that  despite our requirements  exercise undue influence over decisions by current and prospective clients  occupy positions with obligations of fidelity or fiduciary obligations to current and prospective clients  or who offer bribes or kickbacks to current and prospective clients or their employees may be committing wrongful or illegal acts that could render any resulting contract between us and the client unenforceable or in violation of relevant laws or regulations 
any misconduct by these third parties with respect to current or prospective clients  any failure to follow contractual requirements  or any insufficiency of those contractual requirements may result in allegations that we have encouraged or participated in wrongful or illegal behavior and that payments to such third parties under our channel contracts are improper 
this misconduct could subject us to civil or criminal claims and liabilities  require us to change or terminate some portions of our business  require us to refund portions of our services fees  and adversely affect our revenue and operating margin 
even an unsuccessful challenge of our activities could result in adverse publicity  require costly response from us  impair our ability to attract and maintain clients  and lead analysts or investors to reduce their expectations of our performance  resulting in reduction in the market price of our stock 
failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could increase our expenses  decrease our revenue  and prevent us from implementing our business strategy 
we have been experiencing a period of rapid growth 
to manage our anticipated future growth effectively  we must continue to maintain  and may need to enhance  our information technology infrastructure and financial and accounting systems and controls  as well as manage expanded operations in geographically distributed locations 
we also must attract  train  and retain a significant number of qualified sales and marketing personnel  professional services personnel  software engineers  technical personnel  and management personnel 
failure to manage our rapid growth effectively could lead us to over invest or under invest in technology and operations  result in weaknesses in our infrastructure  systems  or controls  give rise to operational mistakes  losses  or loss of productivity or business opportunities  and result in loss of employees and reduced productivity of remaining employees 
our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects  such as the development of new services 
if our management is unable to effectively manage our growth  our expenses may increase more than expected  our revenue could decline or may grow more slowly than expected  and we may be unable to implement our business strategy 
we depend upon two third party service providers for important processing functions 
if either of these third party providers does not fulfill its contractual obligations or chooses to discontinue its services  our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed 
we have entered into service agreements with international business machines corporation and vision business process solutions inc  a subsidiary of dell  inc formerly perot systems corporation  to provide data entry and other services from facilities located in india and the philippines to support our client service operations 
among other things  these providers process critical claims data and clinical documents 
if these services fail or are of poor quality  our business  reputation  and operating results could be harmed 
failure of 
table of contents either service provider to perform satisfactorily could result in client dissatisfaction  disrupt our operations  and adversely affect operating results 
with respect to these service providers  we have significantly less control over the systems and processes involved than if we maintained and operated them ourselves  which increases our risk 
in some cases  functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary systems and software to which we have no access 
if we need to find an alternative source for performing these functions  we may have to expend significant money  resources  and time to develop the alternative  and if this development is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business  we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to clients or the expectations of clients  with the attendant potential for liability claims and a loss of business reputation  loss of ability to attract or maintain clients  and reduction of our revenue or operating margin 
various risks could affect our worldwide operations  exposing us to significant costs 
we conduct operations throughout the world  including the united states  india  and the philippines  either directly or through our service providers 
such worldwide operations expose us to potential operational disruptions and costs as a result of a wide variety of events  including local inflation or economic downturn  currency exchange fluctuations  political turmoil  terrorism  labor issues  natural disasters  and pandemics 
any such disruptions or costs could have a negative effect on our ability to provide our services or meet our contractual obligations  the cost of our services  client satisfaction  our ability to attract or maintain clients  and  ultimately  our profits 
because competition for our target employees is intense  we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees we need to support our planned growth 
to continue to execute on our growth plan  we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  especially for senior sales executives and engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing software and internet related services 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have 
in addition  in making employment decisions  particularly in the internet and high technology industries  job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment 
volatility in the price of our stock may  therefore  adversely affect our ability to attract or retain key employees 
furthermore  the requirements to expense equity awards may discourage us from granting the size or type of equity awards that job candidates require to join our company 
if we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel  our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed 
if we acquire companies or technologies in the future  they could prove difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value  and adversely affect our operating results and the value of our common stock 
as part of our business strategy  we may acquire  enter into joint ventures with  or make investments in complementary companies  services  and technologies in the future 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks  including difficulties in identifying and acquiring products  technologies  or businesses that will help our business  difficulties in integrating operations  technologies  services  and personnel  diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations  the risk of entering new markets in which we have little to no experience  risks related to the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  
table of contents the risk of write offs and the amortization of expenses related intangible assets and delays in client purchases due to uncertainty and the inability to maintain relationships with clients of the acquired businesses 
as a result  if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions  we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate  and management resources and attention may be diverted from other necessary or valuable activities 
we may require additional capital to support business growth  and this capital might not be available 
we intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities  including the need to develop new services or enhance our existing service  enhance our operating infrastructure  or acquire complementary businesses and technologies 
accordingly  we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences  and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or as a result of the current condition of the equity and debt markets limited financing may be available  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
if we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the services we sell in additional jurisdictions  we may be subject to liability for past sales and incur additional related costs and expenses  and our future sales may decrease 
we may lose sales or incur significant expenses should states be successful in imposing state sales and use taxes on our services 
a successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales  decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers  and otherwise harm our business 
each state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes  and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time 
we review these rules and regulations periodically and  when we believe our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state  voluntarily engage state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations 
for example  in april we entered into a settlement agreement with the ohio department of taxation after it determined that we owed sales and use taxes for sales made in the state of ohio between july and january in connection with this settlement  we paid the state of ohio million in taxes  interest  and penalties 
additionally  in november  we began paying sales and use taxes in the state of texas 
we cannot assure you that we will not be subject to sales and use taxes or related penalties for past sales in states where we believe no compliance is necessary 
vendors of services  like us  are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales and similar taxes 
if one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have  but have not  been paid with respect to our services  we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward 
liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges 
our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes 
nevertheless  clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes 
if we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties  and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts  we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial 
moreover  imposition of such taxes on our services going forward 
table of contents will effectively increase the cost of such services to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing clients or to gain new clients in the areas in which such taxes are imposed 
we may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pay sales and use taxes 
for example  in october  we received an audit notification from the commonwealth of massachusetts department of revenue requesting materials relating to the amount of use tax we paid on account of our purchases for the audit periods between january   and december  the audit was resolved in we paid a liability of approximately million in connection with this audit 
the incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with  and the assessment of taxes  interest  and penalties as a result of  audits  litigation  or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time we may become subject to income tax audits or similar proceedings  and as a result we may incur additional costs and expenses or owe additional taxes  interest  and penalties in amounts that may be material 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states at both the federal and state levels 
in determining our provision for income taxes  we are required to exercise judgment and make estimates where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
while we believe that our estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination of any tax audit or tax related litigation will not be materially different from that reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
the incurrence of additional accounting and legal costs and related expenses in connection with  and the assessment of taxes  interest  and penalties as a result of  audits  litigation  or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the irs completed the audit of our   and tax returns commenced earlier in the year and found that no amounts were due from us in connection with either return 
unanticipated changes in our tax rates or our exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our operating results and financial condition 
our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by unanticipated changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  the geographic mix of our revenue  or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance  however  that the outcomes from these continuous examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
additionally  due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and our ability to realize our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the results of our review of our revenue recognition practices and resulting restatement may continue to have adverse effects on our financial results 
our review of our revenue recognition practices and our restatement of our historical financial statements have resulted in the deferral of previously recognized revenue and have required and may continue to require us to expend significant management time and incur significant accounting  legal  and other expenses  all of which may have an adverse effect on our financial results 
as a result of our revenue recognition review and related restatement  approximately million of implementation services revenue previously recognized through september   will be deferred to periods after that date 
see the explanatory note regarding restatement immediately preceding item of part i  part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and note  restatement and reclassification of previously issued consolidated financial statements  and note  summarized quarterly unaudited financial data  in notes to consolidated 
table of contents financial statements in part ii  item for further discussion 
the accounting  legal  and other expenses associated with this restatement may also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  future private or government actions may be brought against us or our current or former officers relating to a failure to apply generally accepted accounting principles in the reporting of quarterly and annual financial statements and securities prospectuses from the time of our initial public offering to our most recent filing with the sec 
such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows and the trading price for our securities 
litigation would be time consuming  expensive  and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the defense of any litigation would result in significant expenditures and the continued diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business 
in addition  while we maintain standard directors and officers insurance  all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any or all of these claims may not be covered by insurance 
we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken that address this restatement will ensure that restatements will not occur in the future 
execution of restatements like the one described above could create a significant strain on our internal resources  cause delays in our filing of quarterly or annual financial results  increase our costs  and cause management distraction 
we have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  which has required us to incur substantial costs and diverted management resources in connection with our efforts to remediate this material weakness in connection with our internal accounting policy review of our revenue recognition policies for the fiscal year ended december   and as discussed in item a  controls and procedures  of this annual report on form k  we have identified a control deficiency relating to the application of generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition 
management has concluded that this control deficiency constituted a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of december  a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is one or more deficiencies in process that create a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
the deficiency in the application of our controls relating to the review of our revenue recognition policy resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements would not have been prevented or detected by us in the normal course of our financial statement close process 
we have discussed the identified control deficiency in our financial reporting and the remediation of such deficiency with the audit committee of our board of directors and will continue to do so as necessary 
we believe that recent key additions to our financial staff  the use of external experts  and revisions to our internal training programs have remediated this control deficiency 
however  we cannot be certain that the remedial measures that we have taken will ensure that we maintain adequate controls over our financial reporting in the future and  accordingly  additional material weaknesses could occur or be identified 
any future deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information  and the current and future deficiencies may impact investors confidence in our internal controls and our company  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we may be unable to adequately protect  and we may incur significant costs in enforcing  our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
our success depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
we rely upon a combination of trademark  trade secret  copyright  patent  and unfair competition laws  as well as license and access agreements and other contractual provisions  to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights 
in addition  we attempt to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring certain of our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality  noncompetition  and assignment of inventions agreements 
our attempts to protect our intellectual property may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
while we have one issued us patent and have nine 
table of contents more us patent applications and two provisional patent applications pending  we may be unable to obtain further meaningful patent protection for our technology 
in addition  any patents issued in the future may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be successfully challenged by third parties 
agreement terms that address non competition are difficult to enforce in many jurisdictions and may not be enforceable in any particular case 
to the extent that our intellectual property and other proprietary rights are not adequately protected  third parties might gain access to our proprietary information  develop and market products or services similar to ours  or use trademarks similar to ours  each of which could materially harm our business 
existing us federal and state intellectual property laws offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we now or may in the future conduct operations or contract for services may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
further  our platform incorporates open source software components that are licensed to us under various public domain licenses 
while we believe that we have complied with our obligations under the various applicable licenses for open source software that we use  there is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses  and therefore the potential impact of such terms on our business is somewhat unknown 
the failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights could materially harm our business 
in addition  if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  even if we were to prevail 
any litigation that may be necessary in the future could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights 
the software and internet industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  trademarks  and copyrights and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
moreover  our business involves the systematic gathering and analysis of data about the requirements and behaviors of payers and other third parties  some or all of which may be claimed to be confidential or proprietary 
we have received in the past  and may receive in the future  communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others 
for example  in  billingnetwork patent  inc sued us in florida federal court alleging infringement of its patent issued in entitled integrated internet facilitated billing  data processing and communications system 
although we settled this case in  the prospect of similar litigation remains 
our technologies may not be able to withstand third party claims of rights against their use 
any intellectual property claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and expensive to resolve  divert management attention from executing our business plan  and require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  many of our contracts contain warranties with respect to intellectual property rights  and some require us to indemnify our clients for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling on such a claim 
moreover  any settlement or adverse judgment resulting from such a claim could require us to pay substantial amounts of money or obtain a license to continue to use the technology or information that is the subject of the claim  or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology or information 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  from third parties asserting an infringement claim  that we would be able to develop alternative technology on a timely basis  if at all  or that we would be able to obtain a license to use a suitable alternative technology to permit us to continue offering  and our clients to continue using  our affected services 
accordingly  an adverse determination could prevent us from offering our services to others 
in addition  we may be required to indemnify our clients for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which would increase the cost to us of an adverse ruling for such a claim 
we are bound by exclusivity provisions that restrict our ability to enter into certain sales and marketing relationships in order to market and sell our services 
our marketing and sales agreement with worldmed shared services  inc d b a pss world medical shared services  inc  or pss  restricts us during the term of the agreement from certain sales and marketing relationships  including relationships with certain competitors of pss and certain distributors and 
table of contents manufacturers of medical  surgical  or pharmaceutical supplies 
this restriction may make it more difficult for us to realize sales  distribution  and income opportunities with certain potential clients in particular small physician practices which could adversely affect our operating results 
our loan and capital lease agreements contain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities 
we have loan and capital lease agreements with million outstanding at december  borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets  including our intellectual property 
our loan agreements restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  make investments  sell assets  pay dividends or make distributions on and  in certain cases  repurchase our stock  or consolidate or merge with other entities 
in addition  our credit facilities require us to meet specified minimum financial measurements 
the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in these credit facilities  as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into  may restrict our ability to finance our operations  engage in business activities  or expand or fully pursue our business strategies 
our loan agreements also contain certain financial and nonfinancial covenants  including limitations on our consolidated leverage ratio and capital expenditures  as well as defaults relating to non payment  breach of covenants  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  default under other indebtedness including a cross default with our interest rate swap  bankruptcy and insolvency  inability to pay debts  attachment of assets  adverse judgments  erisa violations  invalidity of loan and collateral documents  and change of control 
our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control  and we may not be able to meet those covenants 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under either or both of the loan agreements  which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under both credit facilities to become immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
we have entered into a derivative contract with a financial counterparty  the effectiveness of which is dependent on the continued viability of this financial counterparty  and its nonperformance could harm our financial condition 
we have entered into an interest rate swap contract as part of our strategy to mitigate risks related to fluctuations in cash flow from movement in interest rates 
the effectiveness of our hedging programs using this instrument is dependent  in part  upon the counterparty to this contract honoring its financial obligations 
the recent upheaval in the capital markets has caused the viability of certain counterparties to be questioned 
while we have not experienced any losses due to counterparty nonperformance  if our counterparty is unable to perform its obligations in the future  we could be exposed to increased earnings and cash flow volatility 
we may incur additional costs as a result of continuing to operate as a public company  and our management may be required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company  and greater expenditures may be necessary in the future with the advent of new laws and regulations pertaining to public companies 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and the nasdaq global select market  have imposed various requirements on public companies  including requiring changes in corporate governance practices 
our management and other personnel continue to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives  and additional laws and regulations may divert further management resources 
moreover  if we are not able to comply with the requirements of new compliance initiatives in a timely 
table of contents manner  the market price of our stock could decline  and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the nasdaq global select market  the securities and exchange commission  or other regulatory authorities  which would require additional financial and management resources 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements 
our financial statements are subject to the application of us gaap  which are periodically revised or expanded 
accordingly  from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb and the sec 
it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
current and future litigation against us could be costly and time consuming to defend 
we are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business  such as claims brought by our clients in connection with commercial disputes and employment claims made by our current or former employees 
litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources  which may seriously harm our business  overall financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  legal claims that have not yet been asserted against us may be asserted in the future 
insurance may not cover such claims  be sufficient for one or more such claims  or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us 
a claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs  thereby reducing our operating results and leading analysts or potential investors to reduce their expectations of our performance resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock 
risks related to our service offerings our proprietary software or our services may not operate properly  which could damage our reputation  give rise to claims against us  or divert application of our resources from other purposes  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
proprietary software development is time consuming  expensive  and complex 
unforeseen difficulties can arise 
we may encounter technical obstacles  and it is possible that we discover additional problems that prevent our proprietary athenanet application from operating properly 
if athenanet does not function reliably or fails to achieve client expectations in terms of performance  clients could assert liability claims against us and or attempt to cancel their contracts with us 
this could damage our reputation and impair our ability to attract or maintain clients 
moreover  information services as complex as those we offer have in the past contained  and may in the future develop or contain  undetected defects or errors 
we cannot assure you that material performance problems or defects in our services will not arise in the future 
errors may result from receipt  entry  or interpretation of patient information or from interface of our services with legacy systems and data that we did not develop and the function of which is outside of our control 
despite testing  defects or errors may arise in our existing or new software or service processes 
because changes in payer requirements and practices are frequent and sometimes difficult to determine except through trial and error  we are continuously discovering defects and errors in our software and service processes compared against these requirements and practices 
these defects and errors and any failure by us to identify and address them could result in loss of revenue or market share  liability to clients or others  failure to achieve market acceptance or expansion  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  and increased service and maintenance costs 
defects or errors in our software and service processes might discourage existing or potential clients from purchasing services from us 
correction of defects or errors could prove to be impossible or impracticable 
the costs incurred in correcting any defects or errors or in responding to resulting claims or liability may be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents in addition  clients relying on our services to collect  manage  and report clinical  business  and administrative data may have a greater sensitivity to service errors and security vulnerabilities than clients of software products in general 
we market and sell services that  among other things  provide information to assist care providers in tracking and treating ill patients 
any operational delay in or failure of our technology or service processes may result in the disruption of patient care and could cause harm to patients and thereby harm our business and operating results 
our clients or their patients may assert claims against us alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect  error  or other failure of our software or service processes 
a product liability claim or errors or omissions claim could subject us to significant legal defense costs and adverse publicity  regardless of the merits or eventual outcome of such a claim 
if our security measures are breached or fail  and unauthorized access is obtained to a client s data  our services may be perceived as not being secure  clients may curtail or stop using our services  and we may incur significant liabilities 
our services involve the storage and transmission of clients proprietary information and protected health information of patients 
because of the sensitivity of this information  security features of our software are very important 
if our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance  insufficiency  defective design  or otherwise  someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to client or patient data 
as a result  our reputation could be damaged  our business may suffer  and we could face damages for contract breach  penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations  and significant costs for remediation and remediation efforts to prevent future occurrences 
we rely upon our clients as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it  such as administration of client side access credentialing and control of client side display of data 
on occasion  our clients have failed to perform these activities 
failure of clients to perform these activities may result in claims against us that this reliance was misplaced  which could expose us to significant expense and harm to our reputation 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients 
in addition  our clients may authorize or enable third parties to access their client data or the data of their patients on our systems 
because we do not control such access  we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems 
failure by our clients to obtain proper permissions and waivers may result in claims against us or may limit or prevent our use of data  which could harm our business 
we require our clients to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive  and we require contractual assurances from them that they have done so and will do so 
if they do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers  then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws 
this could impair our functions  processes  and databases that reflect  contain  or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data 
in addition  this could interfere with or prevent creation or use of rules  and analyses or limit other data driven activities that benefit us 
moreover  we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of lack of valid notice  permission  or waiver 
these claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our operating results 
various events could interrupt clients access to athenanet  exposing us to significant costs 
the ability to access athenanet is critical to our clients administering care  cash flow  and business viability 
our operations and facilities are vulnerable to interruption and or damage from a number of sources  many of which are beyond our control  including  without limitation i power loss and telecommunications failures  ii fire  flood  hurricane  and other natural disasters  iii software and hardware errors  failures  or crashes in our own systems or in other systems  and iv computer viruses  hacking  and similar disruptive problems in our own systems and in other systems 
we attempt to mitigate these risks through various means  
table of contents including redundant infrastructure  disaster recovery plans  business continuity plans  separate test systems  and change control and system security measures  but our precautions will not protect against all potential problems 
if clients access is interrupted because of problems in the operation of our facilities  we could be exposed to significant claims by clients or their patients  particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to clients or medical information relevant to patient care 
our plans for disaster recovery and business continuity rely upon third party providers of related services  and if those vendors fail us at a time that our systems are not operating correctly  we could incur a loss of revenue and liability for failure to fulfill our obligations 
any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our services  which would adversely impact our revenues 
in addition  retention and availability of patient care and physician reimbursement data are subject to federal and state laws governing record retention  accuracy  and access 
some laws impose obligations on our clients and on us to produce information to third parties and to amend or expunge data at their direction 
our failure to meet these obligations may result in liability that could increase our costs and reduce our operating results 
interruptions or delays in service from our third party data hosting facilities could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business 
we currently serve our clients from a third party data hosting facility located in bedford  massachusetts  operated by digital middlesex  llc as successor to sentinel properties bedford  llc 
in addition  in december we signed a contract with a major provider of disaster recovery services  sungard availability services  lp  to store our disaster recovery plans  deepen the resiliency of our technology recovery infrastructure  and provide disaster recovery testing services 
in the case of a significant event at our primary data center  we could become operational in a reasonable timeframe at our backup data center 
however  we do not control the operation of any of these facilities  and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunications failures  and similar events 
they are also subject to break ins  sabotage  intentional acts of vandalism  and similar misconduct 
despite precautions taken at these facilities  the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism  a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice  or other unanticipated problems at both facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service 
even with the disaster recovery arrangements  our services could be interrupted 
we rely on internet infrastructure  bandwidth providers  data center providers  other third parties  and our own systems for providing services to our users  and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users  adversely affecting our brand and our business 
our ability to deliver our internet and telecommunications based services is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the internet and other telecommunications services by third parties 
this includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed  data capacity  and security for providing reliable internet access and services and reliable telephone  facsimile  and pager systems 
our services are designed to operate without interruption in accordance with our service level commitments 
however  we have experienced and expect that we will in the future experience interruptions and delays in services and availability from time to time 
we rely on internal systems as well as third party vendors  including data center  bandwidth  and telecommunications equipment providers  to provide our services 
we do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services 
in the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities  we may experience an extended period of system unavailability  which could negatively impact our relationship with users 
to operate without interruption  both we and our service providers must guard against damage from fire  power loss  and other natural disasters  communications failures  
table of contents software and hardware errors  failures  and crashes  security breaches  computer viruses  and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
any disruption in the network access  telecommunications  or co location services provided by these third party providers or any failure of or by these third party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business 
we exercise limited control over these third party vendors  which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide 
any errors  failures  interruptions  or delays experienced in connection with these third party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and adversely affect our business and could expose us to third party liabilities 
although we maintain insurance for our business  the coverage under our policies may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
in addition  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at an acceptable cost 
the reliability and performance of the internet may be harmed by increased usage or by denial of service attacks 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damages to portions of its infrastructure  and it could face outages and delays in the future 
these outages and delays could reduce the level of internet usage as well as the availability of the internet to us for delivery of our internet based services 
we rely on third party computer hardware and software that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors or failures of our services  which could damage our reputation  harm our ability to attract and maintain clients  and decrease our revenue 
we rely on computer hardware purchased or leased and software licensed from third parties in order to offer our services  including database software from oracle corporation and storage devices from international business machines corporation and emc corporation 
these licenses are generally commercially available on varying terms  however  it is possible that this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services until equivalent technology is either developed by us  or  if available  is identified  obtained  and integrated  which could harm our business 
any errors or defects in third party hardware or software could result in errors or a failure of our services  which could damage our reputation  harm our ability to attract and maintain clients  and decrease our revenue 
we are subject to the effect of payer and provider conduct that we cannot control and that could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses 
we offer certain electronic claims submission services for which we rely on content from clients  payers  and others 
while we have implemented certain features and safeguards designed to maximize the accuracy and completeness of claims content  these features and safeguards may not be sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims data from being submitted to payers 
should inaccurate claims data be submitted to payers  we may experience poor operational results and may be subject to liability claims  which could damage our reputation with clients and result in liability claims that increase our expenses 
if our services fail to provide accurate and timely information  or if our content or any other element of any of our services is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment  we could have liability to clients  clinicians  or patients  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our software  content  and services are used to assist clinical decision making and provide information about patient medical histories and treatment plans 
if our software  content  or services fail to provide accurate and timely information or are associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment  then clients  clinicians  or their patients could assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us  harm our reputation in the industry  and cause demand for our services to decline 

table of contents our proprietary athenaclinicals service is utilized in clinical decision making  provides access to patient medical histories  and assists in creating patient treatment plans  including the issuance of prescription drugs 
if our athenaclinicals service fails to provide accurate and timely information  or if our content or any other element of that service is associated with faulty clinical decisions or treatment  we could have liability to clients  clinicians  or patients 
the assertion of such claims and ensuing litigation  regardless of its outcome  could result in substantial cost to us  divert management s attention from operations  damage our reputation  and decrease market acceptance of our services 
we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages and to require that our clients assume responsibility for medical care and approve key system rules  protocols  and data 
despite these precautions  the allocations of responsibility and limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable  be binding upon patients  or otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
we maintain general liability and insurance coverage  but this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us 
in addition  the insurer might disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
one or more large claims could exceed our available insurance coverage 
our proprietary software may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released 
it is challenging for us to test our software for all potential problems because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments or treatment methodologies that our clients may deploy or rely upon 
from time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our software  and such defects or errors can be expected to appear in the future 
defects and errors that are not timely detected and remedied could expose us to risk of liability to clients  clinicians  and patients and cause delays in introduction of new services  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications  or decrease market acceptance or client satisfaction with our services 
if any of these risks occur  they could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
we may be liable for use of incorrect or incomplete data that we provide  which could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we store and display data for use by healthcare providers in treating patients 
our clients or third parties provide us with most of these data 
if these data are incorrect or incomplete or if we make mistakes in the capture or input of these data  adverse consequences  including death  may occur and give rise to product liability and other claims against us 
in addition  a court or government agency may take the position that our storage and display of health information exposes us to personal injury liability or other liability for wrongful delivery or handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information 
while we maintain insurance coverage  we cannot assure that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
even unsuccessful claims could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources 
a claim brought against us that is uninsured or under insured could harm our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks related to regulation government regulation of healthcare creates risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  legislative  regulatory  and other influences 
existing and new laws and regulations affecting the healthcare industry could create unexpected liabilities for us  cause us to incur additional costs  and restrict our operations 
many healthcare laws are complex  and their application to specific services and relationships may not be clear 
in particular  many existing healthcare laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate the healthcare information services that we provide  and these laws and regulations may be applied to our services in ways that we do not anticipate 
our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations  or our other 
table of contents failure to comply  could create liability for us  result in adverse publicity  and negatively affect our business 
some of the risks we face from healthcare regulation are described below false or fraudulent claim laws 
there are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement 
in some cases  these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment 
any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability including  but not limited to  criminal liability  adversely affect demand for our services  and force us to expend significant capital  research and development  and other resources to address the failure 
errors by us or our systems with respect to entry  formatting  preparation  or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations 
any determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties  invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts  require us to change or terminate some portions of our business  require us to refund portions of our services fees  cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers  and have an adverse effect on our business 
in most cases where we are permitted to do so  we calculate charges for our services based on a percentage of the collections that our clients receive as a result of our services 
to the extent that violations or liability for violations of these laws and regulations require intent  it may be alleged that this percentage calculation provides us or our employees with incentive to commit or overlook fraud or abuse in connection with submission and payment of reimbursement claims 
the us centers for medicare and medicaid services has stated that it is concerned that percentage based billing services may encourage billing companies to commit or to overlook fraudulent or abusive practices 
in addition  we may contract with third parties that offer software relating to the selection or verification of codes used to identify and classify the services for which reimbursement is sought 
submission of codes that do not accurately reflect the services provided or the location or method of their provision may constitute a violation of false or fraudulent claims laws 
our ability to comply with these laws depends on the coding decisions made by our clients and the accuracy of our vendors software and services in suggesting possible codes to our clients and verifying that proper codes have been selected 
hipaa and other health privacy regulations 
there are numerous federal and state laws related to patient privacy 
in particular  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  includes privacy standards that protect individual privacy by limiting the uses and disclosures of individually identifiable health information and implementing data security standards that require covered entities to implement administrative  physical  and technological safeguards to ensure the confidentiality  integrity  availability  and security of individually identifiable health information in electronic form 
hipaa also specifies formats that must be used in certain electronic transactions  such as claims  payment advice  and eligibility inquiries 
because we translate electronic transactions to and from hipaa prescribed electronic formats and other forms  we are a clearinghouse and  as such  a covered entity 
in addition  our clients are also covered entities and are mandated by hipaa to enter into written agreements with us known as business associate agreements that require us to safeguard individually identifiable health information 
business associate agreements typically include a description of our permitted uses of individually identifiable health information  a covenant not to disclose the information except as permitted under the agreement and to make our subcontractors  if any  subject to the same restrictions  assurances that appropriate administrative  physical  and technical safeguards are in place to prevent misuse of the information  an obligation to report to our client any use or disclosure of the information other than as provided for in the agreement  
table of contents a prohibition against our use or disclosure of the information if a similar use or disclosure by our client would violate the hipaa standards  the ability of our clients to terminate the underlying support agreement if we breach a material term of the business associate agreement and are unable to cure the breach  the requirement to return or destroy all individually identifiable health information at the end of our support agreement  and access by the department of health and human services to our internal practices  books  and records to validate that we are safeguarding individually identifiable health information 
we may not be able to adequately address the business risks created by hipaa implementation 
furthermore  we are unable to predict what changes to hipaa or other laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance 
for example  the provisions of the hitech act and the regulations issued under it have provided and are expected to provide clarification of certain aspects of both the privacy and security rules  expansion of the disclosure requirements for a breach of the security rule  and strengthening of the civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with hipaa 
in addition  the federal office of the national coordinator for health information technology  or onchit  is coordinating the ongoing development of national standards for creating an interoperable health information technology infrastructure based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the healthcare sector 
we are unable to predict what  if any  impact the changes in such standards will have on our compliance costs or our services 
in addition  some payers and clearinghouses with which we conduct business interpret hipaa transaction requirements differently than we do 
where clearinghouses or payers require conformity with their interpretations as a condition of effecting transactions  we seek to comply with their interpretations 
the hipaa transaction standards include proper use of procedure and diagnosis codes 
since these codes are selected or approved by our clients  and since we do not verify their propriety  some of our capability to comply with the transaction standards is dependent on the proper conduct of our clients 
among our services  we provide telephone reminder services to patients  internet and telephone based access to medical test results  pager and email notification to practices of patient calls  and patient call answering services 
we believe that reasonable efforts to prevent disclosure of individually identifiable health information have been and are being taken in connection with these services  including the use of multiple password security 
however  any failure of our clients to provide accurate contact information for their patients or physicians or any breach of our telecommunications systems could result in a disclosure of individually identifiable health information 
in addition to the hipaa privacy and security rules and the hitech act requirements  most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information  and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area  including privacy safeguards  security standards  and data security breach notification requirements 
such state laws  if more stringent than hipaa and hitech act requirements  are not preempted by the federal requirements  and we are required to comply with them 
failure by us to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy may subject us to penalties  including civil monetary penalties and  in some circumstances  criminal penalties 
in addition  such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients 
we are subject to a variety of other regulatory schemes  including red flag rules 
although the federal and state laws regarding patient privacy help to maintain the confidentiality of personal information that could be used in identity theft  they were not drafted with that risk in mind 
to fill this gap  the federal trade commission has issued new rules under the fair and accurate credit transactions act of that go into effect on june  these rules require medical practices that act as creditors to their patients to adopt policies and procedures that identify 
table of contents patterns  practices  or activities that indicate possible identity theft called red flags  detect those red flags  and respond appropriately to those red flags to prevent or mitigate any theft 
the rules also require creditors to update their policies and procedures on a regular basis 
because most practices treat their patients without receiving full payment at the time of service  our clients are generally considered creditors for purposes of these rules and are required to comply with them 
although we are not directly subject to these rules since we do not extend credit to customers we do handle patient data that  if improperly disclosed  could be used in identity theft 
if we are not successful in assisting our clients in implementing necessary procedures  such failure may injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain clients and attract new clients 
anti kickback and anti bribery laws 
there are federal and state laws that govern patient referrals  physician financial relationships  and inducements to healthcare providers and patients 
for example  the federal healthcare programs anti kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering  paying  soliciting  or receiving anything of value  directly or indirectly  for the referral of patients covered by medicare  medicaid  and other federal healthcare programs or the leasing  purchasing  ordering  or arranging for or recommending the lease  purchase  or order of any item  good  facility  or service covered by these programs 
many states also have similar anti kickback laws that are not necessarily limited to items or services for which payment is made by a federal healthcare program 
moreover  both federal and state laws forbid bribery and similar behavior 
any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our activities or those of our clients  vendors  or channel partners violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties  require us to change or terminate some portions of our business  require us to refund a portion of our service fees  disqualify us from providing services to clients doing business with government programs  and have an adverse effect on our business 
even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us 
anti referral laws 
there are federal and state laws that forbid payment for patient referrals  patient brokering  remuneration of patients  or billing based on referrals between individuals and or entities that have various financial  ownership  or other business relationships with health care providers 
in many cases  billing for care arising from such actions is illegal 
these vary widely from state to state  and one of the federal laws called the stark law is very complex in its application 
any determination by a state or federal regulatory agency that any of our clients violate or have violated any of these laws may result in allegations that claims that we have processed or forwarded are improper 
this could subject us to civil or criminal penalties  require us to change or terminate some portions of our business  require us to refund portions of our services fees  and have an adverse effect on our business 
even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us 
corporate practice of medicine laws and fee splitting laws 
many states have laws forbidding physicians from practicing medicine in partnership with non physicians  such as business corporations 
in some states  including new york  these take the form of laws or regulations forbidding splitting of physician fees with non physicians or others 
in some cases  these laws have been interpreted to prevent business service providers from charging their physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges 
we have varied our charge structure in some states to comply with these laws  which may make our services less desirable to potential clients 
any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties  invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts  require us to change or terminate some portions of our business  require us to refund portions of our services fees  and have an adverse effect on our business 
even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us 
anti assignment laws 
there are federal and state laws that forbid or limit assignment of claims for reimbursement from government funded programs 
in some cases  these laws have been interpreted in regulations or policy statements to limit the manner in which business service companies may handle checks or other payments for such claims and to limit or prevent such companies from charging their 
table of contents physician clients on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges 
any determination by a state court or regulatory agency that our service contracts with our clients violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties  invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts  require us to change or terminate some portions of our business  require us to refund portions of our services fees  and have an adverse effect on our business 
even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us 
prescribing laws 
the use of our software by physicians to perform a variety of functions relating to prescriptions  including electronic prescribing  electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies  and dispensing of medication  is governed by state and federal law  including fraud and abuse laws  drug control regulations  and state department of health regulations 
states have differing prescription format requirements  and  due in part to recent industry initiatives  federal law and the laws of all states now provide a regulatory framework for the electronic transmission of prescription orders 
regulatory authorities such as the us department of health and human services centers for medicare and medicaid services may impose functionality standards with regard to electronic prescribing and ehr technologies 
any determination that we or our clients have violated prescribing laws may expose us to liability  loss of reputation  and loss of business 
these laws and requirements may also increase the cost and time necessary to market new services and could affect us in other respects not presently foreseeable 
electronic medical records laws 
a number of federal and state laws govern the use and content of electronic health record systems  including fraud and abuse laws that may affect how such technology is provided 
as a company that provides ehr functionality  our systems and services must be designed in a manner that facilitates our clients compliance with these laws 
because this is a topic of increasing state and federal regulation  we expect additional and continuing modification of the current legal and regulatory environment 
we cannot predict the content or effect of possible future regulation on our business activities 
the software component of our athenaclinicals service complies with the cchit criteria for ambulatory electronic health records for due to the possible incorporation of cchit s criteria into the meaningful use standards under the hitech act such certification may become a de facto requirement for selling ehr systems in the future  however  cchit s certification requirements may change substantially 
onchit may approve another certification body for ehrs and we plan on meeting onchit certification criteria 
while we believe that our system is well designed in terms of function and interoperability  we cannot be certain that it will meet future requirements 
claims transmission laws 
our services include the manual and electronic transmission of our client s claims for reimbursement from payers 
federal and various state laws provide for civil and criminal penalties for any person who submits  or causes to be submitted  a claim to any payer including  without limitation  medicare  medicaid  and any private health plans and managed care plans that is false or that overbills or bills for items that have not been provided to the patient 
although we do not determine what is billed to a payer  to the extent that such laws apply to a service that merely transmits claims on behalf of others  we could be subject to the same civil and criminal penalties as our clients 
prompt pay laws 
laws in many states govern prompt payment obligations for healthcare services 
these laws generally define claims payment processes and set specific time frames for submission  payment  and appeal steps 
they frequently also define and require clean claims 
failure to meet these requirements and timeframes may result in rejection or delay of claims 
failure of our services to comply may adversely affect our business results and give rise to liability claims by clients 
medical device laws 
the us food and drug administration fda has promulgated a draft policy for the regulation of computer software products as medical devices under the medical device amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
to the extent that computer software is a medical device under the policy  we  as a provider of application functionality  could be required  depending on the functionality  to register and list our products with the fda  
table of contents notify the fda and demonstrate substantial equivalence to other products on the market before marketing our functionality  or obtain fda approval by demonstrating safety and effectiveness before marketing our functionality 
the fda can impose extensive requirements governing pre and post market conditions such as service investigation and others relating to approval  labeling  and manufacturing 
in addition  the fda can impose extensive requirements governing development controls and quality assurance processes 
potential healthcare reform and new regulatory requirements placed on our software  services  and content could impose increased costs on us  delay or prevent our introduction of new services types  and impair the function or value of our existing service types 
our services may be significantly impacted by healthcare reform initiatives and are subject to increasing regulatory requirements  either of which could affect our business in a multitude of ways 
if substantive healthcare reform or applicable regulatory requirements are adopted  we may have to change or adapt our services and software to comply 
reform or changing regulatory requirements may render our services obsolete or may block us from accomplishing our work or from developing new services 
this may in turn impose additional costs upon us to adapt to the new operating environment or to further develop services or software 
it may also make introduction of new service types more costly or more time consuming than we currently anticipate 
such changes may even prevent introduction by us of new services or make the continuation of our existing services unprofitable or impossible 
potential additional regulation of the disclosure of health information outside the united states may adversely affect our operations and may increase our costs 
federal or state governmental authorities may impose additional data security standards or additional privacy or other restrictions on the collection  use  transmission  and other disclosures of health information 
legislation has been proposed at various times at both the federal and the state level that would limit  forbid  or regulate the use or transmission of medical information outside of the united states 
such legislation  if adopted  may render our use of our off shore partners  such as our data entry and customer service providers  international business machines corporation and vision business process solutions inc  for work related to such data impracticable or substantially more expensive 
alternative processing of such information within the united states may involve substantial delay in implementation and increased cost 
changes in the healthcare industry could affect the demand for our services  cause our existing contracts to terminate  and negatively impact the process of negotiating future contracts 
as the healthcare industry evolves  changes in our client and vendor bases may reduce the demand for our services  result in the termination of existing contracts  and make it more difficult to negotiate new contracts on terms that are acceptable to us 
for example  the current trend toward consolidation of healthcare providers within hospital systems may cause our existing client contracts to terminate as independent practices are merged into hospital systems 
such larger healthcare organizations may also have their own practice management services and health it systems  reducing demand for our services 
similarly  client and vendor consolidation results in fewer  larger entities with increased bargaining power and the ability to demand terms that are unfavorable to us 
if these trends continue  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to maintain or expand our client base  negotiate contracts with acceptable terms  or maintain our current pricing structure  and our revenues may decrease 
errors or illegal activity on the part of our clients may result in claims against us 
we require our clients to provide us with accurate and appropriate data and directives for our actions 
we also rely upon our clients as users of our system to perform key activities in order to produce proper claims for reimbursement 
failure of our clients to provide these data and directives or to perform these activities may result in claims against us alleging that our reliance was misplaced or unreasonable or that we have facilitated or otherwise participated in submission of false claims 

table of contents our services present the potential for embezzlement  identity theft  or other similar illegal behavior by our employees or subcontractors with respect to third parties 
among other things  our services involve handling mail from payers and from patients for many of our clients  and this mail frequently includes original checks and or credit card information and occasionally includes currency 
even in those cases in which we do not handle original documents or mail  our services also involve the use and disclosure of personal and business information that could be used to impersonate third parties or otherwise gain access to their data or funds 
if any of our employees or subcontractors takes  converts  or misuses such funds  documents  or data  we could be liable for damages  and our business reputation could be damaged or destroyed 
in addition  we could be perceived to have facilitated or participated in illegal misappropriation of funds  documents  or data and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability 
potential subsidy of services similar to ours may reduce client demand 
recently  entities such as the massachusetts healthcare consortium have offered to subsidize adoption by physicians of electronic health record technology 
in addition  federal regulations have been changed to permit such subsidy from additional sources subject to certain limitations  and the current administration has passed the hitech act  which will provide federal support for ehr initiatives 
to the extent that we do not qualify or participate in such subsidy programs  demand for our services may be reduced  which may decrease our revenues 
risks related to ownership of our common stock an orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to remain highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition to the factors discussed in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  these factors include our operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies  the overall performance of the equity markets  announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions  business plans  or commercial relationships  threatened or actual litigation  changes in laws or regulations relating to the sale of health insurance  any major change in our board of directors or management  publication of research reports or news stories about us  our competitors  or our industry or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts  large volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders  and general political and economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for internet related companies in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company s securities 
this litigation  if instituted against us  could result in very substantial costs  divert our management s attention and resources  and harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 

table of contents if a substantial number of shares become available for sale and are sold in a short period of time  the market price of our common stock could decline 
if our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock or the public market perceives that these sales may occur  the market price of our common stock could decline 
as of december   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding 
moreover  the holders of shares of common stock have rights  subject to some conditions  to require us to file registration statements covering the shares they currently hold  or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders 
we have also registered all common stock that we may issue under our stock plan  stock plan  stock option and incentive plan  and employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had outstanding options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock approximately million of which were exercisable at december  that  if exercised  will result in those shares becoming available for sale in the public market 
if a large number of these shares are sold in the public market  the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock 
actual or potential sales of our stock by our employees  including members of our senior management team  pursuant to pre arranged stock trading plans could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons  and actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors 
in accordance with the guidelines specified under rule b of the securities and exchange act of and our policies regarding stock transactions  a number of our employees  including members of our senior management team  have adopted and will continue to adopt pre arranged stock trading plans to sell a portion of our common stock 
generally  stock sales under such plans by members of our senior management team and directors require public filings 
actual or potential sales of our stock by such persons could cause our stock price to fall or prevent it from increasing for numerous reasons 
for example  a substantial amount of our common stock becoming available or being perceived to become available for sale in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to fall or prevent it from increasing 
also  actual or potential sales by such persons could be viewed negatively by other investors 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws or delaware law might discourage  delay  or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and  therefore  depress the trading price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws and delaware law may discourage  delay  or prevent a merger  acquisition  or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock 
these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management 
these provisions include limitations on the removal of directors  advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings  and the ability of our board of directors to make  alter  or repeal our by laws 
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote is necessary to amend or repeal the above provisions of our certificate of incorporation 
as our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval  the effective number of votes required to make such changes could increase 
also  absent approval of our board of directors  our by laws may only be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of our shares of capital stock entitled to vote 

table of contents in addition  section of the delaware general corporation law prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder generally an entity that  together with its affiliates  owns  or within the last three years has owned  or more of our voting stock for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the entity became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
the existence of the foregoing provisions and anti takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
they could also deter potential acquirers of our company  thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock  and  consequently  your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not currently intend to do so for the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to invest our future earnings  if any  to fund our growth 
therefore  you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future  and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value 
there is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our stockholders have purchased their shares

overview athenahealth is a leading provider of internet based business services for physician practices 
our service offerings are based on four integrated components our proprietary internet based software  our continually updated database of payer reimbursement process rules  our back office service operations that perform administrative aspects of billing and clinical data management for physician practices  and our automated and live patient communication services 
our principal offering  athenacollector  automates and manages billing related functions for physician practices and includes a medical practice management platform 
we have also developed a service offering  athenaclinicals  that automates and manages medical record related functions for physician practices and includes an electronic health record  or ehr  platform 
remindercall  which we added to our service suite in september  is our automated appointment reminder system that allows patients to 
table of contents either confirm the appointment or request rescheduling 
we have now combined remindercall with other automated patient messaging services  live operator services  and a patient web portal in the first edition of our athenacommunicator services suite that we beta launched in and expect to offer commercially in the first half of we refer to athenacollector as our revenue cycle management service  athenaclinicals as our clinical cycle management service  and athenacommunicator as our patient cycle management service 
as a complement to these services  our newest offering  anodyne analytics  is a web based  software as a service business intelligence platform that organizes and displays detailed and insightful practice performance data for decision makers at our client practices 
our services are designed to help our clients achieve faster reimbursement from payers  reduce error rates  increase collections  lower operating costs  improve operational workflow controls  improve patient satisfaction and compliance  and more efficiently manage clinical and billing information 
in  we generated revenue of million from the sale of our services compared to million in and million in given the scope of our market opportunity  we have increased our spending each year on growth  innovation  and infrastructure 
despite increased spending in these areas  higher revenue and lower direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue have led to greater operating income 
however  the reversal of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that occurred in the fourth quarter of has had and will have an impact on net profits as our results are now fully taxed 
our revenues are predominately derived from business services that we provide on an ongoing basis 
this revenue is generally determined as a percentage of payments collected by us on behalf of our clients  so the key drivers of our revenue include growth in the number of physicians working within our client accounts and the collections of these physicians 
to provide these services  we incur expense in several categories  including direct operating  selling and marketing  research and development  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization expense 
in general  our direct operating expense increases as our volume of work increases  whereas our selling and marketing expense increases in proportion to our rate of adding new accounts to our network of physician clients 
our other expense categories are less directly related to growth of revenues and relate more to our planning for the future  our overall business management activities  and our infrastructure 
as our revenues have grown  the difference between our revenue and our direct operating expense also has grown  which has afforded us the ability to spend more in other categories of expense and to experience an increase in operating margin 
we manage our cash and our use of credit facilities to ensure adequate liquidity  in adherence to related financial covenants 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue from two sources from business services associated with our revenue cycle and clinical cycle offerings and from implementation and other services 
implementation and other services consist primarily of professional services fees related to assisting clients with the initial implementation of our services and for ongoing training and related support services 
business services accounted for approximately   and of our total revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively 
business services fees are typically to of a practice s total collections depending upon the size  complexity  and other characteristics of the practice  plus a per statement charge for billing statements that are generated for patients 
accordingly  business services fees are largely driven by the number of physician practices we serve  the number of physicians and other medical providers working in those physician practices  the volume of activity and related collections of those physicians and other medical providers  and our contracted rates 
there is moderate seasonality in the activity level of physician practices 
typically  discretionary use of physician services declines in the late summer and during the holiday season  which leads to a decline in collections by our physician clients about to days later 
none of our clients accounted for more than of our total revenues for the years ended december    or operating expense direct operating expense 
direct operating expense consists primarily of salaries  benefits  claim processing costs  other direct costs  and stock based compensation related to personnel who provide services to clients  including staff who implement new clients 
we expense implementation costs as incurred 
although 
table of contents we expect that direct operating expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future  the direct operating expense is expected to decline as a percentage of revenues as we further increase the percentage of transactions that are resolved on the first attempt and as we decrease the cost of implementation for new clients 
in addition  over the longer term  we expect to increase our overall level of automation and to reduce our direct operating expense as a percentage of revenues as we become a larger operation  with higher volumes of work in particular functions  geographies  and medical specialties 
in and  we include in direct operating expense the service costs associated with our athenaclinicals offering  which includes transaction handling related to lab requisitions  lab results entry  fax classification  and other services 
we also expect these costs to increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future but to decline as a percentage of revenue 
this decrease will be driven by increased levels of automation and by economies of scale 
direct operating expense does not include allocated amounts for rent  depreciation  and amortization  except for amortization related to purchased intangible assets 
selling and marketing expense 
selling and marketing expense consists primarily of marketing programs including trade shows  brand messaging  and on line initiatives and personnel related expense for sales and marketing employees including salaries  benefits  commissions  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense 
although we recognize substantially all of our revenue when services have been delivered  we recognize a large portion of our sales commission expense at the time of contract signature and at the time our services commence 
accordingly  we incur a portion of our sales and marketing expense prior to the recognition of the corresponding revenue 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing by hiring additional direct sales personnel to add new clients and increase sales to our existing clients 
we also plan to expand our marketing activities in certain areas  such as attending trade shows  expanding user groups  and creating new printed materials 
as a result  we expect that  in the future  sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute terms but remain relatively consistent over time as a percentage of revenue 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel related expenses for research and development employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense and consulting fees for third party developers 
we expect that  in the future  research and development expense will increase in absolute terms but not as a percentage of revenue as new services and more mature products require incrementally less new research and development investment 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel related expense for administrative employees including salaries  benefits  stock based compensation  non billable travel  lodging  and other out of pocket employee related expense  occupancy and other indirect costs including building maintenance and utilities  and insurance  as well as software license fees  outside professional fees for accountants  lawyers  and consultants  and compensation for temporary employees 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute terms for the foreseeable future as we invest in infrastructure to support our growth and incur additional expense related to being a publicly traded company 
though expenses are expected to continue to rise in absolute terms  we expect general and administrative expense to decline as a percentage of overall revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense consists primarily of depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of capitalized software development costs  which we amortize over a two year period from the time of release of related software code 
because our core revenue cycle application is relatively mature  we expense those costs as incurred  and  as a result  in approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized 
in the year ended december   approximately were expensed rather than capitalized 
in the year ended december   approximately were expensed rather than capitalized 
as we grow  we will continue to make capital investments in the infrastructure of the business  and we will continue to develop software that we capitalize 
at the same time  because we are spreading fixed costs over a larger client base  we expect related depreciation and amortization expense to decline as a percentage of revenues over time 

table of contents other income expense 
interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our former working capital line of credit  our equipment related term leases  our term loan and revolving loans under our credit facility  and our former subordinated term loan  offset by interest income on investments 
interest income represents earnings from our cash  cash equivalents  and investments 
the gain or loss on interest rate derivative contract represents the change in the fair market value of a derivative instrument that is not designated a hedge under the authoritative accounting guidance 
although this derivative has not been designated for hedge accounting  we believe that such instrument is correlated with the underlying cash flow exposure related to variability in interest rate movements on our term loan 
in  the unrealized loss on warrant liability represents the change in the fair value of our warrants to purchase shares of our preferred stock at the end of each reporting period 
this warrant liability and associated accounting to recognize this liability at its fair value  ceased upon the completion of our initial public offering  at which time the associated liability converted to additional paid in capital 
acquisitions acquisition in october  the company acquired anodyne health partners  inc  a software as a service business intelligence company based in alpharetta  georgia 
we believe that the acquisition of anodyne provides us with expanded service offerings that will better enable us to compete in the large medical group market 
the anodyne software as a service business intelligence tool enhances customers ability to view all facets of its revenue cycle information and to access and extract critical operational and administrative information from various data systems 
consideration for this transaction was million plus potential additional consideration of million which will be paid over a three year period if anodyne achieves certain business and financial milestones 
acquisition in september  we acquired specified assets and assumed specified liabilities of crest line technologies  llc dba medicalmessaging 
net 
medicalmessaging is a provider of live and automated calling services for healthcare professionals 
the purpose of the acquisition is to augment our core business service offering with medicalmessaging s automated and live communication services 
we believe the purchase of medicalmessaging gave us access to a developed technology that could speed the time to market versus internal development of our own similar product 
in addition  we plan to leverage its existing customer base to increase revenues of the medicalmessaging services 
consideration for this transaction was million plus potential additional consideration of million which will be paid over a three year period if medicalmessaging achieves certain financial milestones 
as of december   we have paid million of the additional consideration 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors we believe to be relevant at the time we prepared our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and 
table of contents liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
significant estimates and assumptions are used for  but are not limited to revenue recognition  including our estimated expected customer life  allowance for doubtful accounts  asset impairments depreciable lives of assets  economic lives and fair value of leased assets  income tax reserves and valuation allowances  fair value of stock options  allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales  and litigation reserves 
future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty  and accordingly  our accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations 
actual results could differ from the estimates we have used 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  as they require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions revenue recognition we derive its revenue from business services associated with our revenue cycle and clinical cycle offerings and from implementation and other services 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the client  the collection of the fees is reasonably assured  and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
our arrangements do not contain general rights of return 
all revenue  other than implementation revenue  is recognized when the service is performed 
relative to our business services offering that is based on the collections of amounts by our customers  we do not recognize revenue until our customers have been paid 
as the implementation service is not separable from the ongoing business services  we record implementation fees as deferred revenue until the implementation service is complete  at which time we recognize revenue ratably on a monthly basis over the longer of the estimated expected customer life or contract life 

table of contents effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions our clients typically purchase one year contracts that renew automatically upon completion 
in most cases  our clients may terminate their agreements with days notice without cause 
we typically retain the right to terminate client agreements in a similar timeframe 
our clients are billed monthly  in arrears  based either upon a percentage of collections posted to athenanet  minimum fees  flat fees  or per claim fees where applicable 
invoices are generated within the first two weeks of the month and delivered to clients primarily by email 
for most of our clients  fees are then deducted from a pre defined bank account one week after invoice receipt via an auto debit transaction 
amounts that have been invoiced are recorded as revenue or deferred revenue  as appropriate  and are included in our accounts receivable balances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based on an assessment of the collectability of specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  and other economic information on both an historical and prospective basis 
customer account balances are charged against the allowance when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
changes in the allowance during fiscal and were not material 
there is no off balance sheet credit exposure related to customer receivable balances 
we are required to recognize our non refundable up front fees over the contract term or estimated expected customer life  whichever is longer 
the determination of the amount of revenue we can recognize each accounting period requires management to make estimates and judgments on the estimated expected customer life 
we determined the estimated customer life considering the following key factors renewal rate considerations economic life of the product or service industry data marketing studies data used to set the pricing terms of the arrangement 
our estimate of expected customer life may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the revenue recognized in an accounting period 
for example  if in the future  we need to increase our estimated expected performance period to a period longer than years  the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would decrease 
on the other hand  if in the future  we need to decrease our estimated expected customer life to a period shorter than years  the amount we would recognize in each accounting period would increase 
the amount of deferred revenue related to non refundable up front fees is million as of december  
table of contents effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are also recorded with respect to net operating losses and other tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income of the period that includes the enactment date 
a high degree of judgment is required to determine if  and the extent to which  valuation allowances should be recorded against deferred tax assets 
since december   we have not had a valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
contingent tax liabilities are based on our assessment of the likelihood that we have incurred a liability 
such liabilities are reviewed based on recent changes in tax laws and regulations  including judicial rulings 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in income taxes that could be material 
in addition  we are required to establish reserves for tax contingencies 
share based compensation athenahealth grants various nonqualified stock based compensation awards  including stock options 
the share based compensation expense and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in fiscal year was million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options  which is expected to be recognized through we estimate the fair value of each stock option award on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model  which requires us to make estimates regarding expected option life  stock price volatility and other assumptions 
we have not had sufficient history as a publicly traded company to evaluate its volatility factor and expected term 
as such  we analyzed the volatilities and expected terms of a group of peer companies to support the assumptions used in its calculations for the years ended december    and we averaged the volatilities of the peer companies with in the money options  sufficient trading history and similar vesting terms to generate the assumptions detailed above 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
in addition  we are required to utilize an estimated forfeiture rate when calculating the expense for the period 
we believe that there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under the authoritative guidance 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of the authoritative guidance in future periods than those currently  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what we have historically reported for future grants 
if the volatility percentage used in calculating our stock compensation expense had fluctuated by  the total stock compensation expense to be recognized over the stock options four year vesting period would have increased or decreased by approximately million 
if the forfeiture rate used in calculating our stock compensation expense had fluctuated by  the total stock compensation expense to be recognized over the stock options four year vesting period would have decreased or increased by approximately million 

table of contents effect if actual results description judgments and uncertainties differ from assumptions software development costs software development costs for internal use are expensed or capitalized based on the stage of development for the software 
under this guidance  costs related to the preliminary project stage of subsequent versions of athenanet and or other technology are expensed as incurred 
costs incurred in the application development stage are capitalized 
such costs are amortized over the software s estimated economic life of two years 
in  approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized  based upon the stage of development of the software 
in the year ended december   approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized 
in the year ended december   approximately of our software development expenditures were expensed rather than capitalized 
although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in software development costs that could be material 
contingent consideration contingent consideration in a business combination is measured at fair value at the acquisition date  with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings 
significant judgment is employed in determining the appropriateness of these assumptions as of the acquisition date and for each subsequent period 
accordingly  future business and economic conditions  as well as changes in any of the assumptions described above  can materially impact the amount of contingent consideration expense we record in any given period 
each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain acquisitions to their then fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and record decreases in the fair value as a reduction of contingent consideration expense 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations can result from changes in assumed discount periods and rates  changes in the assumed timing and amount of revenue and expense estimates 
we recorded potential contingent consideration of million in the initial purchase price allocation at its estimated fair value of million related to the anodyne health partners  inc acquisition in october

we believe that the acquisitions provide us with expanded service offerings that will better enable it to compete in this market 
given our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  and funds available under our existing revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our business and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months 
we may increase our capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in infrastructure and personnel and as we expand our national presence 
in addition  we may pursue acquisitions or investments in complementary businesses or technologies or experience unexpected operating losses  in which case we may need to raise additional funds sooner than expected 
accordingly  we may need to engage in private or public equity or debt financings to secure additional funds 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities  our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution  and any new equity securities we issue could have rights  preferences  and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock 
any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters  which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities  including potential acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain required financing on terms satisfactory to us  our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited 
beyond the twelve month period  we intend to maintain sufficient liquidity through continued improvements in the size and profitability of our business and through prudent management of our cash resources and our credit arrangements

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on business combinations 
this guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements significant aspects of a business combination 
under this guidance  acquisition costs are generally expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development ipr d is recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination are generally expensed rather than capitalized  contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date  with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the measurement period will affect income tax expense 
we adopted this guidance on january  and during the year ended december   expensed approximately million of acquisition costs that  prior to the change in accounting  would have been included as part of the purchase price 
in addition  under the provisions of guidance  future reversal of our current acquisition related tax reserves of approximately million excluding interest and penalties will be recorded in earnings  rather than as an adjustment to goodwill or acquisition related other intangible assets and will affect the company s annual effective income tax rate 
the potential contingent consideration of million was recorded in the initial purchase price allocation at its estimated fair value of million 
the contingent consideration will be accreted to the amount payable when  and if  earned 
the difference between the estimated and earn out amount will be charged or credited to expense 
the contingent consideration for acquisitions which occurred prior to this change will be recorded as additional goodwill when it is earned 
in october  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective for periods beginning january   with earlier adoption permitted 
under the new guidance on arrangements that include software elements  tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
additionally  the fasb issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the new guidance includes new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this authoritative guidance might have on our financial statements  if any 
from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb and are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued 
table of contents accounting pronouncements will not have a material impact on consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  or do not apply to our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the indian rupee 
none of our consolidated revenues are generated outside the united states 
none of our vendor relationships  including our contracts with our offshore service providers  international business machines corporation and vision process business solutions inc  for work performed in india or the philippines  is denominated in any currency other than the us dollar 
although the contracts are denominated in us dollars  the fees in one of our vendor contracts are subject to adjustment based upon fluctuation in exchange rates between the india rupees and the us dollar 
in and  and  respectively  of our expenses occurred in our direct subsidiary in chennai  india  and were incurred in indian rupees 
we therefore believe that the risk of a significant impact on our operating income from foreign currency fluctuations is not substantial 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million at december  these amounts are held for working capital purposes and were invested primarily in deposits  money market funds  and short term  interest bearing  investment grade securities 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the value of these securities  however  will be subject to interest rate risk and could fall in value if interest rates rise 
interest rate risk as of december   we had long term debt and capital lease obligations totaling million  which have both variable and fixed interest rate components 
we have entered into interest rate swaps as a hedge relating to variability in interest rate movements on our term loan 
for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant
