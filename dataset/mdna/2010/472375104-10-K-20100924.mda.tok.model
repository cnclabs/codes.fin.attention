item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the objective of this section is to help shareholders and potential investors understand our views on our results of operations and financial condition 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this report 

table of contents overview 
income we have two primary sources of pre tax income 
the first is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments and interest expense which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
our second principal source of pre tax income is fee income the compensation we receive from providing products and services 
most of our fee income comes from service charges on now accounts and fees for late loan payments 
we also earn fee income from atm charges  insurance commissions  safe deposit box rentals and other fees and charges 
we occasionally recognize gains or losses as a result of sales of investment securities or foreclosed real estate 
these gains and losses are not a regular part of our income 
expenses the expenses we incur in operating our business consist of compensation and benefits expenses  occupancy expenses  equipment and data processing expense  deposit insurance premiums  advertising expenses  expenses for foreclosed real estate and other miscellaneous expenses 
compensation and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees  fees paid to our directors and expenses for retirement and other employee benefits 
occupancy expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of building and equipment  consist primarily of lease payments  real estate taxes  depreciation charges  maintenance and costs of utilities 
equipment and data processing expense includes fees paid to our third party data processing service and expenses and depreciation charges related to office and banking equipment 
deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the federal deposit insurance corporation for insurance of our deposit accounts 
expenses for foreclosed real estate include maintenance and repairs on foreclosed properties prior to sale 
other expenses include expenses for attorneys  accountants and consultants  payroll taxes  franchise taxes  charitable contributions  insurance  office supplies  postage  telephone and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
we consider the following to be our critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses and deferred income taxes 
allowance for loan losses 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
management reviews the level of the allowance on a monthly basis and establishes the provision for loan losses based on the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency levels  loss experience  economic condition and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors 
in addition  tennessee department of financial institutions and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 

table of contents deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is established 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change

the company determined that it was appropriate to reduce the level of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of state of franklin bancshares  based on an annual review of goodwill performed by an independent third party 
results for fiscal were also negatively impacted by a significant increase in the provision for loan losses during fiscal year due to continued decline in real estate values  higher levels of both net charge offs and nonperforming assets and continued deterioration in local and national economic conditions

the deposit base is comprised of checking  savings  money market and time deposits 
these deposits are provided primarily by individuals and businesses within our market area 
we do not use brokered deposits as a source of funding 
total deposits decreased million  to million at june  primarily due to planned runoff of higher costing time deposits which more than offset increases in transaction accounts 
management monitors the deposit mix and deposit pricing on a regular basis and has focused on growth in lower cost transaction accounts

unrealized gains and losses  net of taxes  in the available for sale investment portfolio are reflected as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
at june   the adjustment to stockholders equity was a net unrealized gain of million compared to a net unrealized gain of  at june  allowance for loan losses and asset quality allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish reserves against losses on loans on a monthly basis 
when additional reserves are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
in connection with assessing the allowance  we have established a systematic methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology utilizes a loan grading system which segments loans with similar risk characteristics 
management performs a monthly assessment of the allowance for loan losses based on the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  the amount of impaired and classified loans and historical loan loss experience 
in addition  management considers other qualitative factors  including delinquency trends  economic conditions and loan considerations 
the tennessee department of financial institutions and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
the tennessee department of financial institutions and fdic may require us to make additional provisions for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
the allowance for loan losses increased million to million at june  the increase in the allowance for loan losses reflects higher levels of net charge offs  increases in nonperforming assets  continued decline in real estate values  and continued deterioration in local and national economic conditions 
primarily as a result of management s evaluation of credit quality and current economic conditions  the provision for loan losses was million for fiscal  compared to a provision of  for fiscal net charge offs were million for fiscal compared to  for fiscal at june   our allowance for loan losses represented of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans  compared to of total gross loans and of nonperforming loans at june  although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations 
furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to increase our allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations

when a loan becomes days delinquent  the loan is placed on nonaccrual status at which time the accrual of interest ceases and the reserve for any uncollectible accrued interest is established and charged against operations 
typically  payments received on a nonaccrual loan are applied to the outstanding principal and interest as determined at the time of collection of the loan 
we consider repossessed assets and loans that are days or more past due to be nonperforming assets 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lower of its cost  which is the unpaid balance of the loan plus foreclosure costs  or fair market value at the date of foreclosure 
holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
nonperforming assets increased to million  or of total assets  at june   compared to million  or at june  as a result of the economic downturn 
foreclosed real estate increased million to million at june  at june   foreclosed real estate consisted of million of single family homes  million of vacant land and million of commercial real estate 
nonaccrual loans totaled million at june  compared to million at june  the increase in nonaccrual loans is primarily due to an increase in both nonaccrual commercial and residential real estate loans 
under current accounting guidelines  a loan is defined as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we consider consumer installment loans to be homogeneous and  therefore  do not separately evaluate them for impairment 
all other loans are evaluated for impairment on an individual basis 
at june   impaired loans totaled million

we review and classify our assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the tennessee department of financial institutions has the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention 
when we classify an asset as substandard or doubtful we must establish a general allowance for loan losses 
if we classify an asset as loss  we must either establish specific allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss or charge off such amount 

table of contents the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our classified assets at the dates indicated 
at june  in thousands substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total classified assets at each of the dates in the above table  substandard assets consisted of nonperforming assets plus other loans that we believed exhibited weakness 
these substandard but performing loans totaled million  million and million at june   and  respectively 
at june   we also had million of loans that we were monitoring because of concerns about the borrowers ability to continue to make payments in the future  none of which were nonperforming or classified as substandard

at june   delinquent loans consisted primarily of loans secured by residential real estate 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of investment securities and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are invested generally in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term us government agency obligations 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at june   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  interest bearing deposits totaled million  and fed funds sold totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at june  at june   fhlb advances were million and represented full utilization of the company s borrowing capacity with the fhlb 
additional eligible collateral may

the company also maintains federal funds lines with two banks totaling million under which no borrowings were outstanding 
in addition  the company maintains borrowing capacity with the federal reserve bank of atlanta  which amounted to approximately million at june  at june   we had million in commitments to extend credit 
in addition  we had million in unused letters of credit and million in unused lines of credit 
certificates of deposit due within one year of june  totaled million 
we believe  based on past experience  that a significant portion of those deposits will remain with us 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered

in the year ended june   we originated million of loans 
in fiscal  we originated million of loans and in fiscal we originated million of loans 
financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net decrease in total deposits of million in the year ended june   a net decrease in total deposits of million for the year ended june  and a net increase in total deposits of million for the year ended june   respectively 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors and other factors 
we generally manage the pricing of our deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit relationships 
occasionally  we offer promotional rates on certain deposit products in order to attract deposits 
federal home loan bank advance activity reflected a decrease of million at june  and a decrease of  and million at june  and  respectively 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal prompt corrective action regulations  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at june   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see regulation of the bank capital requirements 
jefferson bancshares is a separate entity and apart from jefferson federal and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  jefferson bancshares is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its shareholders  and interest and principal on outstanding debt 
at times  jefferson bancshares has redeemed and returned its stock 
substantially all of jefferson bancshares revenues are obtained from subsidiary service fees and dividends 
payment of such dividends to jefferson bancshares by jefferson federal is limited under tennessee law 
the amount that can be paid in any calendar year  without prior approval from the tennessee department of financial institutions  cannot exceed the total of jefferson federal s net income for the year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years 
jefferson bancshares believes that such restriction will not have an impact on its ability to meet its ongoing cash obligations 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments  unused lines of credit  amounts due mortgagors on construction loans  amounts due on commercial loans and commercial letters of credit 
for the three months and year ended june   we engaged in no off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of new accounting pronouncements the impact of new accounting pronouncements is discussed in note to the company s audited consolidated financial statements beginning on page f and incorporated herein by reference 
effect of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this prospectus have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qualitative aspects of market risk 
our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
pursuant to this strategy  we actively originate adjustable rate mortgage loans for retention in our loan portfolio 
these loans generally reprice beginning after five years and annually thereafter 
most of our residential adjustable rate mortgage loans may not adjust downward below their initial interest rate 
although historically we have been successful in originating adjustable rate mortgage loans  the ability to originate such loans depends to a great extent on market interest rates and borrowers preferences 
this product enables us to compete in the fixed rate mortgage market while maintaining a shorter maturity 
fixed rate mortgage loans typically have an adverse effect on interest rate sensitivity compared to adjustable rate loans 
in recent years  we have used investment securities with terms of seven years or less and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities to help manage interest rate risk 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of off balance sheet derivative financial instruments 
we have established an asset liability committee to communicate  coordinate and monitor all aspects involving asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
we monitor the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and present value of equity using rate shock analysis 
the present value of equity is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities 
this analysis assesses the risk of loss in market risk sensitive instruments in the event of a sudden and sustained to basis point increase or to basis point 
table of contents decrease in market interest rates with no effect given to any steps that we might take to counter the effect of that interest rate movement 
because of the low level of market interest rates  this analysis is not performed for decreases of more than basis points 
we measure interest rate risk by modeling the changes in net portfolio value over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
the following table presents the estimated impact on net interest income and equity due to immediate changes in interest rates at the specified levels at june  change in change in interest rates in basis points net interest income economic value of equity change change market value change no change we use certain assumptions in assessing interest rate risk that relate to interest rates  loan prepayment rates  deposit decay rates and the market values of certain assets under differing interest rate scenarios  among others 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates
