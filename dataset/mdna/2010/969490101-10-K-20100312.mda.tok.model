item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration  development  acquisition  and production company 
our basic business model is to increase shareholder value by finding and developing oil and gas reserves through exploration and development activities  and selling the production from those reserves at a profit 
to be successful  we must  over time  be able to find oil and gas reserves and then sell the resulting production at a price that is sufficient to cover our finding costs  operating expenses  administrative costs and interest expense  plus offer us a return on our capital investment 
from time to time  we may also acquire producing properties if we believe the acquired assets offer us the potential for reserve growth through additional developmental or exploratory drilling activities 
our business in was adversely affected by the recession that began in and continues to impact the united states and other global economies 
reduced demand for energy caused oil and gas prices to fall sharply  resulting in a significant deterioration in our operating margins oil and gas sales less production costs 
the effects of lower operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the present value of our proved oil and gas reserves 
these factors have an adverse effect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base 
lower operating margins also offer us less incentive to assume the drilling risks that are inherent in our business 
as a result  we suspended our developmenta l drilling program in the permian basin and the austin chalk trend in late and turned our business focus toward preserving short term liquidity and conserving capital resources 
by the end of the second quarter of  operating margins on oil prone properties had begun to improve somewhat due to a combination of higher oil prices and lower costs of field services caused by decreased demand for those services 
since most of our developmental drilling locations are oil prone  we elected to resume drilling developmental oil wells primarily in andrews county  texas in the permian basin and burleson and robertson counties  texas in the austin chalk trend 
in connection with the return to drilling activities in these areas  we have taken the following actions which we believe will enhance the development of these core areas entered into year agreements with selected service providers to fix unit costs covering approximately of the drilling and completion services provided by third parties  improved drilling efficiencies by acquiring the noncontrolling interest in desta drilling  giving us full control over the management and operation of drilling services  purchased casing and tubing for more than wells at discounts to current market prices  and entered into derivative contracts for most of our estimated proved developed oil production for and at average prices of and per barrel  respectively 
key factors to consider the following summarizes the key factors considered by management in the review of our financial condition and operating performance for and the outlook for our oil and gas sales decreased million  or  from  comprised of million in price variances and million in volume variances 
during  we increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million from million at december  to million at december  in august  we repaid in full all amounts outstanding under the secured term loan of desta drilling with borrowings of approximately million under the revolving credit facility see liquidity and capital resources 
we spent million on exploration and development activities during fiscal  of which approximately was on exploratory prospects 
we currently plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development for fiscal  with approximately applied to developmental activities 
exploration costs were million for  of which approximately million related to unsuccessful exploratory well costs  million related to impairment of unproved acreage and the remaining million was spent on seismic related activities 
most of the abandonment and impairment costs in related to prospects in east texas bossier area  south louisiana and utah 
we recorded a non cash charge during of million for impairments of property and equipment which included million for impairments of certain drilling rigs held for sale and million for impairments of proved oil and gas properties to reduce the carrying values to their estimated fair value based on applicable accounting standards 
at december   our capitalized unproved oil and gas properties totaled million  of which approximately million was attributable to unproved acreage 
unproved properties are subject to a valuation impairment to the extent the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated fair value 
therefore  our results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by unproved property impairments 
we recorded a million net loss on derivatives in fiscal  consisting of a million realized loss on settled contracts and a million loss for changes in mark to market valuations 
since we do not presently designate our derivatives as cash flow hedges under applicable accounting standards  we recognize the full effect of changing prices on mark to market valuations as a current charge or credit to our results of operations 
our estimated proved oil and gas reserves at december  were  mboe compared to  mboe at december  in  we added  mboe through extensions and discoveries  had downward net revisions of  mboe see item properties reserves 
proved oil and gas reserves in  the sec issued its final rule on the modernization of oil and gas reporting  and the fasb adopted conforming changes to asc topic  extractive industries  to align the fasb s reserves requirements with those of the sec 
the final rule is now in effect for companies with fiscal years ending on or after december  as it affects our reserve estimates and disclosures  the final rule amends the definition of proved reserves to require the use of average commodity prices based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices  expands the type of technologies available to establish reserve estimates and categories  modifies certain definitions used in estimating proved reserves  permits disclosure of probable and possible reserves  requires disclosure of internal controls over reserve estimations and the qualifications of technical persons primarily responsible for the preparation or audit of reserve estimates  permits disclosure of reserves based on different price and cost criteria  such as futures prices or management forecasts  and requires disclosure of material changes in proved undeveloped reserves  including a discussion of investments and progress made to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
the following table summarizes changes in our estimated proved reserves during proved reserves mboe as of december  extensions and discoveries revisions production as of december  extensions and discoveries 
extensions and discoveries in added  mboe of proved reserves  replacing of our production 
these additions resulted primarily from our drilling activities in the permian basin and the austin chalk trend despite curtailments of capital spending during the first half of due to recessionary uncertainties 
of the total reserve additions  proved developed reserves accounted for  mboe  while the remaining mboe were proved undeveloped reserves 
revisions 
net downward revisions of  mboe consisted of downward revisions of  mboe related to performance and upward revisions of mboe related to pricing 
substantially all of the downward performance revisions resulted from the reclassification of certain permian basin reserves from proved undeveloped to probable see discussion below regarding changes in proved undeveloped reserves 
net upward revisions of mboe were attributable to the effects of higher product prices on the estimated quantities of proved reserves 
proved undeveloped reserves decreased  mboe in from  mboe at the beginning of the year to  mboe at december  due primarily to the reclassification of  mboe of permian basin reserves from proved undeveloped to probable 
these reclassified reserves relate to undrilled locations acquired in in connection with the purchase of southwest royalties  inc these undrilled locations are on leases which are held by existing production from other wells 
although we expect to develop these reserves in the future  the reserves were downgraded to probable due to a provision in the new sec reserves rule that requires proved undeveloped reserves to be developed within five years from their date of origin 
we added mboe of proved reserves from extensions and discoveries related to nine proved undeveloped locations that we plan to drill in at an expected cost of approximately million 
net downward revisions to proved undeveloped reserves of mboe resulted primarily from the loss of one drilling location due to expiration of drilling rights  offset in part by upward revisions in estimates due to price increases 
we did not convert any proved undeveloped reserves at december  to proved developed reserves during supplemental information the following unaudited information is intended to supplement the consolidated financial statements included in this form k with data that is not readily available from those statements

operating results compared to the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  unless otherwise indicated  references to and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
oil and gas operating results oil and gas sales in decreased million  or  from price variances accounted for a million decrease  and production variances accounted for a million decrease 
in  our realized oil price was lower than while our realized gas price was lower than historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
production in on a boe basis was lower than oil production decreased and gas production decreased in from production costs  consisting of lease operating expenses  production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs  decreased in as compared to some of the key components for the reduction in costs include lower production taxes caused by decreases in commodity prices  lower oilfield service costs and decreases in our overall activity level 
after giving effect to a decrease in oil and gas production on a boe basis  production costs per boe decreased from per boe in to per boe in oil and gas depletion expense increased million from to  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for an million decrease 
on a boe basis  depletion expense increased from per boe in to per boe in due to a combination of higher depletable cost basis and higher depletion rates caused by lower estimated reserves 
depletion expense per boe of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production 
we may realize higher oil and gas depletion rates in future periods if our exploration and development activities result in higher fin ding costs 
we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of million during  of which million related to impairment of certain drilling rigs and related equipment of desta drilling to reduce the carrying value of the equipment to its estimated fair value  and the remaining million related to a provision for impairment of proved properties relating primarily to south louisiana 
exploration costs since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in at december   our capitalized unproved oil and gas properties totaled million  of which approximately million was attributable to unproved acreage 
unproved properties are subject to a valuation impairment to the extent the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated fair value 
therefore  our results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by unproved property impairments 
we plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities in  of which approximately is expected to be allocated to exploration activities  most of which are in oil prone areas 
contract drilling services in  cwei formed a joint venture with lariat services  inc lariat to construct  own  and operate new drilling rigs 
until april   cwei owned a equity interest in this joint venture that we have historically referred to as larclay jv and which we now refer to as desta drilling 
effective april   cwei acquired the remaining equity interest in desta drilling 
as primary beneficiary of desta drilling s expected cash flows  prior to april   we fully consolidated the accounts of desta drilling in our financial statements and accounted for the equity interest owned by lariat as a noncontrolling interest 
we utilize drilling rigs owned by desta drilling to drill wells in our exploration and development activities 
all intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation to the extent of our equity ownership in desta drilling 
accordingly  consolidated drilling services revenues and drilling services costs may vary significantly based on our equity ownership and the percentage of revenues derived from cwei 
since april  desta drilling has worked exclusively for cwei 
as a result  all drilling services revenues received by desta drilling subsequent to april  along with the related drilling services costs  have been eliminated in our consolidated statements of operations 
in april  we adopted a plan of disposition to sell eight of the drilling rigs owned by desta drilling 
as a result  we recorded a million impairment of property and equipment during the second quarter of to write down the rigs to their estimated fair value of million 
in december  we modified the plan of disposition to move six of the previous eight rigs back into operations 
the decision to keep these six drilling rigs was based on an increased requirement for drilling rigs in our developmental drilling program 
as a result  we have recorded million for the remaining two designated rigs as assets held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
general and administrative general and administrative g a expenses decreased from million in to million in excluding employee compensation related to non equity incentive plans  g a expenses decreased from million in to million in due primarily to a one time charge in for cash bonuses paid to employees relating to the sale of certain properties in south louisiana 
employee compensation expense related to non equity incentive plans was million in compared to million in interest expense interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to a combination of reduced consolidated debt levels and lower interest rates 
lower interest rates during were a major component of the decrease in interest expense from the average interest rate for was compared to in the average daily principal balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility for was million compared to million for in addition  capitalized interest for was  compared to million in  and interest expense associated with desta drilling s term loan during was million compared to million in gain loss on derivatives we did not designate any derivative contracts in or as cash flow hedges  therefore all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark to market valuations have been recorded as gain loss on derivatives 
for the year ended december   we reported a million net loss on derivatives  consisting of a million realized loss on settled contracts and a million non cash loss to mark our derivative positions to their fair value at december  for the year ended december   we reported a million net gain on derivatives  consisting of a million realized gain on settled contracts and a million non cash gain to mark our derivative positions to their fair value at december  because oil and gas prices are volatile  and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges  the effect of mark to market valuations on our gain loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations 
gain loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory we recorded a net loss of million on sales of assets and impairment of inventory for related primarily to the impairment of inventory to its estimated market value at december  in  we recorded a net gain on sales of assets and impairment of inventory of million  which included a million gain on sales of properties in south louisiana  a million gain on the sale of a north louisiana prospect  and a million gain on the sales of two drilling rigs and a surplus well servicing unit 
income tax expense benefit our effective income tax rate in of differed from the statutory federal rate of due primarily to increases related to the effects of the texas margin tax and tax benefits derived from statutory depletion deductions  offset by the effects of certain non deductible expenses 
compared to the following discussion compares our results for the year ended december  to the year ended december  unless otherwise indicated  references to and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
oil and gas operating results oil and gas sales in increased million  or  from price variances accounted for million of this increase and production volume variances accounted for the remaining million of incremental sales 
production in on a boe basis was higher than oil production increased and gas production decreased in from the comparability of production between and was affected by two primary factors 
certain south louisiana properties were sold during the second quarter of and south louisiana production in was curtailed due to hurricanes gustav and ike 
in  our realized oil price was higher than  while our realized gas price was higher 
production costs  consisting of lease operating expenses  production taxes and other miscellaneous marketing costs  increased in as compared to some of the key components giving rise to the higher costs included increases in oilfield service costs  higher repair and maintenance costs and increased production tax costs related to higher product prices 
after giving effect to a increase in oil and gas production on a boe basis  production costs per boe increased from per boe in to per boe in oil and gas depletion expense increased million from to  of which rate variances accounted for a million increase and production variances accounted for a million increase 
on a boe basis  depletion expense increased from per boe in to per boe in due to a combination of higher depletable costs and lower estimated reserve quantities in compared to the period 
depletion expense per boe of oil and gas production is an operating metric that is indicative of our weighted average cost to find or acquire a unit of equivalent production 
we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of million during  including million related to the margarita well in our east texas bossier area 
we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of million during  of which million related to write downs of two  horsepower drilling rigs and related components  million related to well service equipment  and million related to producing properties in the permian basin 
exploration costs since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations are adversely affected during any accounting period in which significant seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved acreage impairments are expensed 
in  we charged to expense million of exploration costs  as compared to million in at december   our capitalized unproved oil and gas properties totaled million  of which approximately million was attributable to unproved acreage 
unproved properties are subject to a valuation impairment to the extent the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated fair value 
therefore  our results of operations in future periods may be adversely affected by unproved property impairments 
contract drilling services during  we included contract drilling revenues of million  other operating expenses of million  depreciation expense of million and interest expense of million in our statement of operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since the desta drilling rigs were partially utilized by us  the reported amounts are net of any intercompany profits eliminated in consolidation 
general and administrative g a expenses increased from million in to million in excluding non cash employee compensation  g a expenses increased from million in to million in due in part to cash bonuses paid to employees in connection with our sale of properties in south louisiana and higher personnel costs 
in  we recorded a million non cash compensation charge related to our after payout incentive plan and  for stock based compensation to directors 
in  we recorded a million non cash compensation charge related to our after payout incentive plan and  for stock based compensation to directors 
interest expense interest expense decreased from million in to million in due to a combination of reduced debt levels and lower interest rates 
the average daily principal balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility for was million compared to million for debt reductions on our revolving credit facility accounted for million of the decrease in interest expense  while lower interest rates resulted in a decrease of approximately million 
in addition  capitalized interest for was million compared to million in  and interest expense associated with desta drilling during was million compared to million in gain loss on derivatives we did not designate any derivative contracts in or as cash flow hedges  therefore all cash settlements and changes resulting from mark to market valuations have been recorded as gain loss on derivatives 
for  we reported a million net gain on derivatives  consisting of a million non cash gain to mark our derivative positions to their fair value and a million realized gain on settled contracts 
for  we reported a million net loss on derivatives  consisting of an million non cash loss to mark our derivative positions to their fair value at december  and a million realized loss on settled contracts 
because oil and gas prices are volatile  and because we do not account for our derivatives as cash flow hedges  the effect of mark to market valuations on our gain loss on derivatives can cause significant volatility in our results of operations 
gain loss on sales of assets and impairment of inventory we recorded a net gain on sales of assets and impairment of inventory of million for  which included a million gain on sales of properties in south louisiana  a million gain on the sale of a north louisiana prospect  and a million gain on the sales of two drilling rigs and a surplus well servicing unit 
in  we recorded a net gain of million  which included the sale of all of our producing and non producing acreage in pecos county  texas for million  net of closing costs  and recorded a gain of approximately million in connection with this sale  offset by a million loss due primarily to the write down of inventory to its market value 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate in of differed from the statutory federal rate of due primarily to increases in the tax provision related primarily to the effects of the texas margin tax and certain non deductible expenses  offset in part by tax benefits derived from statutory depletion deductions 
liquidity and capital resources our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to a group of banks to secure our revolving credit facility 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on the revolving credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration and development programs in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
however  the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
our business in was adversely affected by the recession that began in and continues to impact the united states and other global economies 
reduced demand for energy caused oil and gas prices to fall sharply  resulting in a significant deterioration in our operating margins oil and gas sales less production costs 
the effects of lower operating margins on our business are significant since they reduce our cash flow from operations and diminish the pv value of our proved oil and gas reserves 
these factors have an adverse affect on our ability to access the capital resources we need to grow our reserve base 
lower cash flow from operations can limit our ability to incur indebtedness under the indenture d iscussed below  and downward revisions in the pv value of our estimated proved reserves can adversely affect the amount of funds we can borrow on the credit facility 
lower operating margins also offer us less incentive to assume the drilling risks that are inherent in our business 
the indenture governing the issuance of our senior notes due contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness 
one covenant establishes a minimum ratio of consolidated ebitdax to consolidated interest expense as these terms are defined in the indenture 
if we are restricted from incurring indebtedness under this covenant  we may still borrow funds under the revolving credit facility provided that our outstanding balance on the facility does not exceed the greater of million and of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets as defined in the indenture 
based on our pv value at december   this alternative to the ebitdax coverage test would not be available since our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility currently exceed the maxim um permitted 
we currently have  and expect to have in  sufficient ebitdax coverage under the indenture to permit us to borrow funds as needed in to fund our exploration and development activities 
capital expenditures the following table summarizes  by area  our planned expenditures for exploration and development activities during  as compared to our actual expenditures in actual planned expenditures expenditures year ended year ended percentage december  december  of total in thousands permian basin austin chalk trend south louisiana california other a a includes expenditures in in the following areas in thousands east texas bossier  north louisiana  utah  and other  our planned exploration and development activities for are significantly higher than fiscal actual expenditures due to additional planned developmental drilling in the permian basin and the austin chalk trend based on improved operating margins 
however  our actual expenditures during fiscal may vary significantly from these estimates if our plans for exploration and development activities change during the year 
factors  such as changes in operating margins and the availability of capital resources could increase or decrease our ultimate level of expenditures during fiscal we spent million on exploration and development activities during  of which approximately was on developmental drilling 
we currently plan to spend approximately million for fiscal  of which approximately is estimated to be spent on developmental drilling 
we financed these expenditures in with cash flow from operating activities and advances under the revolving credit facility 
based on preliminary estimates  our internal cash flow forecasts indicate that our anticipated operating cash flow will be sufficient to finance our exploration and development activities through although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable  we are unable to predict the extent and duration of lower operating margins resulting fr om the current economic depression 
accordingly  cash flow may be less than expected  the availability of funds under the credit facility may be less than expected  or capital expenditures may be more than expected 
in the event we lack adequate liquidity to finance our expenditures through fiscal  we will consider options for obtaining alternative capital resources  including selling assets or accessing capital markets 
because of significant uncertainties regarding the current economic environment  we can give no assurance that these alternative capital resources can be obtained on terms acceptable to us 
cash flow provided by operating activities substantially all of our cash flow from operating activities is derived from the production of our oil and gas reserves 
we use this cash flow to fund our on going exploration and development activities in search of new oil and gas reserves 
variations in cash flow from operating activities may impact our level of exploration and development expenditures 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  decreased million  or  as compared to the corresponding period in due primarily to a drop in oil and gas sales caused by lower commodity prices 
credit facility we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by jpmorgan chase bank  na we have historically relied on the revolving credit facility for both our short term liquidity working capital and our long term financial needs 
the funds available to us at any time under the revolving credit facility are limited to the amount of the borrowing base determined by the banks 
as long as we have sufficient availability under the revolving credit facility to meet our obligations as they become due  we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and will be able to fund any short term working capital deficit 
the banks redetermine the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility on a semi annual basis  in may and november 
in addition  we or the banks may request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination at other times during the year 
if at any time  the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding credit exposure under the revolving credit facility  we will be required to pledge additional collateral  prepay the principal amount of the loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the excess or prepay the excess in six equal monthly installments 
in october  the borrowing was affirmed by the banks at million 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  including at least of the adjusted engineered value as defined in the revolving credit facility of our oil and gas interests evaluated in determining the borrowing base for the revolving credit facility 
the obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries  excluding wcep  llc 
at our election  interest under the revolving credit facility is determined by reference to libor plus an applicable margin between and per annum or the greatest of a the prime rate  b the federal funds rate plus 
or c one month libor plus plus  in any of a  b or c  an applicable margin between and per annum 
we also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility equal to 
interest and fees are payable quarterly  except that interest on libor based traunches are due at maturity of each traunche but no less frequently than quarterly 
the effective annual interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility  excluding bank fees and amortization of debt issue costs  for the year ended decembe r  was 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which may  among other things  limit our ability to sell assets  incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
one such covenant requires that we maintain a ratio of consolidated current assets to consolidated current liabilities the consolidated current ratio of at least to in computing the consolidated current ratio at any balance sheet date  we must include the amount of funds available under this facility as a current asset  exclude current assets and liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives  exclude current maturities of loans under the revolving credit facility  if any  and exclude current assets and liabilities attributable to vendor financing transactions  if any 
working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital in accordance with gaap 
since compliance with financial covenants is a material requirement under the credit facilities  we consider the loan compliance working capital to be useful as a measure of our liquidity because it includes the funds available to us under the revolving credit facility and is not affected by the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives 
our gaap reported working capital increased from million at december  to million at december  after giving effect to the adjustments  our working capital computed for loan compliance purposes was million at december   as compared to million at december  the following table reconciles our gaap working capital to the working capital computed for loan compliance purposes at december  and december  december  in thousands working capital per gaap add funds available under the revolving credit facility exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities exclude current assets and current liabilities of desta drilling a working capital per loan covenant a in august  we repaid all of the secured term loan of desta drilling with borrowings under our secured bank credit facility due may the revolving credit facility provides that the ratio of our consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated ebitdax the leverage ratio determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter for the then most recently ended four fiscal quarters may not be greater than to for any fiscal quarter ending on or prior to december   to for any fiscal quarter ending on or after march  through december  and to for any fiscal quarter thereafter 
we were in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants at december  however  our increased leverage and reduced liquidity may result in our failing to comply with one or more of these covenants in the future 
if we fail to meet any of these loan covenants  we would ask the banks to waive compliance  amend the loan agreement to allow us to become compliant or grant us sufficient time to obtain additional capital resources through alternative means 
if a suitable arrangement could not be reached with the banks  the banks could accelerate the indebtedness and seek to foreclose on the pledged assets 
the lending group under the revolving credit facility includes the following institutions jpmorgan chase bank  na  union bank of california  na  bank of scotland  bnp paribas  fortis capital corp  compass bank  natixis  bank of texas  na  and frost bank 
from time to time  we engage in other transactions with lenders under the revolving credit facility 
such lenders or their affiliates may serve as counterparties to our commodity and interest rate derivative agreements 
as of december   jpmorgan chase bank  na was the only counterparty to our commodity derivative agreements 
our obligations under existing derivative agreements with our lenders are secured by the security documents executed by the parties under the revolving credit facility 
during  we increased indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility by million 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility  leaving million available on the facility after allowing for outstanding letters of credit totaling  the revolving credit facility matures in may senior notes due in july  we issued  in a private placement  million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at face value and bear interest at per year  payable semi annually on february and august of each year  beginning february  we may redeem some or all of the senior notes at redemption prices expressed as percentages of principal amount equal to for the twelve month period beginning on august   for the twelve month period beginning on august   and beginning on august   for any period thereafter  in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries to borrow money  issue redeemable or preferred stock  pay distributions or dividends  make investments  create liens without securing the senior notes  enter into agreements that restrict dividends from subsidiaries  sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into transactions with affiliates  guarantee indebtedness  and enter into new lines of business 
one such covenant provides that we may only incur indebtedness if the ratio of consolidated ebitdax to consolidated interest expense as these terms are defined in the indenture exceeds to for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters 
however  this restriction does not prevent us from borrowing funds under the revolving credit facility provided that our outstanding balance on the facility does not exceed the greater of million and of adjusted consolidated net tangible assets as defined in the indenture 
these covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications as described in the indenture 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  desta drilling term loan in  desta drilling formerly larclay jv obtained a million secured term loan facility from a lender to finance the construction and equipping of new drilling rigs 
in august  we repaid in full all amounts outstanding under the secured term loan of desta drilling with borrowings of approximately million under our revolving credit facility 
all of the assets of desta drilling were pledged as collateral under our revolving credit facility 
alternative capital resources although our base of oil and gas reserves  as collateral for our revolving credit facility  has historically been our primary capital resource  we have in the past  and we believe we could in the future  use alternative capital resources  such as asset sales  vendor financing arrangements  and or public or private issuances of common stock 
we could also issue senior or subordinated debt or preferred stock in a public or a private placement if we choose to raise capital through either of these markets 
while we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternatives  if needed  there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us 
contractual obligations and contingent commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  by payment due date 
payments due by period total to to in thousands contractual obligations senior notes a secured bank credit facility a lease obligations other total contractual obligations a in addition to the principal payments presented  we expect to make annual interest payments of million on the senior notes and approximately million on the secured bank credit facility based on the balances and interest rates at december  
known trends and uncertainties operating margins we analyze  on a boe produced basis  those revenues and expenses that have a significant impact on our oil and gas operating margins 
our weighted average oil and gas sales per boe have fluctuated from per boe in  to per boe in and to per boe in however  our expenses per boe have been on an upward trend and are resulting in narrowing operating margins 
our oil and gas dd a per boe has increased from per boe in  to per boe in and to per boe in an upward trend in dd a per boe indicates that our cost to find and or acquire reserves is increasing at a faster rate than the reserves we are adding 
although we replaced of our production in  our cost to find those reserves was significantly higher t han our historical combined rate 
also affecting our operating margins is the cost of producing our reserves 
our production costs per boe have fluctuated from per boe in  to per boe in  to per boe in the decrease in operating costs per boe in was due primarily to lower costs of field services and decreased production taxes resulting from lower commodity prices 
during the last half of  operating margins  particularly on oil prone properties  began to improve due to higher oil prices and lower costs of field services 
in recent months  our costs to drill and equip wells in the permian basin and austin chalk trend areas have been significantly lower than the costs we incurred to drill similar wells in as a result of lower service and equipment costs and improved drilling efficiencies obtained through desta drilling 
lower drilling and completion costs should improve our operating margins for as compared to however  any ultimate improvement in our operating margins will be dependent on the quantities of proved reserves and production added through our drilling program 
oil and gas production as with all companies engaged in oil and gas exploration and production  we face the challenge of natural production decline since oil and gas reserves are a depletable resource 
with each unit of oil and gas we produce  we are depleting our proved reserve base  so we must be able to conduct successful exploration and development activities or acquire properties with proved reserves in order to grow our reserve base 
prior to our production had been on a gradual decline since due to the effects of natural production decline  offset in part by reserve additions through exploration and development and acquisitions 
although we increased our production by in over levels  our production in decreased to mmboe from mmboe in  and we replaced only of our oil and gas production through extensions and discoveries 
while these reserve additions will contribute favorably to our production in  we do not expect this production to be sufficient to fully offset the natural production declines from our existing base of oil and gas reserves 
to grow our production in  we will need to add production from wells drilled in through our developmental drilling program 
as discussed above  operating margins began to improve during the last half of as a result  we currently plan to increase capital spending during fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal higher spending levels  if successful  should positively impact our ability to replace production with new reserves 
failure to maintain or grow our oil and gas reserves may result in lower production and may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates summary in this section  we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies estimates or assumptions accounts affected successful efforts accounting reserve estimates oil and gas properties for oil and gas properties valuation of unproved accumulated dd a properties provision for dd a judgment regarding status of in progress exploratory wells impairment of unproved properties abandonment costs dry hole costs impairment of proved reserve estimates and related oil and gas properties properties and long present value of future net contract drilling equipment lived assets revenues proved properties accumulated dd a estimates of future undiscounted impairment of proved properties cash flows long lived assets and long lived assets asset retirement obligations estimates of the present value abandonment obligations of future abandonment costs non current liability oil and gas properties accretion of discount expense inventory stated at average cost estimates of market value of impairment of inventory or estimated market value tubular goods and other well equipment significant estimates and assumptions oil and gas reserves reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of and the interpretation of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
annually  we engage independent petroleum engineering firms to evaluate our oil and gas reserves 
as a part of this process  our internal reservoir engineer and the independent engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions 
the techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data  and the accuracy of the estimates may vary accordingly 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table 
type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed non producing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves 
but more significantly  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
current sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be the arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the month period preceding the effective date of the reserve report 
varying pricing can result in significant changes in reserves and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from period to period  as illustrated in the following table 
standardized measure proved reserves average price of discounted oil a gas oil a gas future mmbbls bcf bbl mcf net cash flows in millions as of december a includes crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids 
valuation of unproved properties estimating fair market value of unproved properties also known as prospects is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects 
the negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect  including the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs  available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity  and other critical services  the nature and extent of geological and geophysical data on the prospect  the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect  such as ownership interests  expiration terms  delay rental obligations  depth limitations  drilling and marketing restrictions  and similar terms  the prospect s risk adjusted potential for return on investment  giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered  drilling and completion costs  prevailing commodity prices  and other economic factors  and the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect s chances of success 
asset retirement obligations we estimate the present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we compute our liability for asset retirement obligations by calculating the present value of estimated future cash flows related to each property 
this requires us to use significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligations 
effects of estimates and assumptions on financial statements generally accepted accounting principles do not require  or even permit  the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates unless such estimates were unreasonable or did not comply with applicable sec accounting rules 
we are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions  taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate 
at each accounting period  we make a new estimate using new data  and continue the cycle 
you should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional information 
while an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date  both may be proper due to the differences in available information or assumptions 
in this section  we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our financial statements 
provision for dd a we compute our provision for dd a on a unit of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for each of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate current period production reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
impairment of unproved properties each quarter  we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been  in our judgment  an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant 
to the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties  and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our statement of operations 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that per iod 
impairment of proved properties and long lived assets each quarter  we assess our producing properties for impairment 
if we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities  we will estimate the value of each affected property 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the value for this purpose is a fair value using level inputs instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the sec 
we attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use 
these parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing  and they may also include th e risk adjusted value of reserves 
to the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated fair value  we make a provision for impairment of proved properties 
if the fair value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated fair value 
if the fair value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
accordingly  the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from and often will be less than the present value of proved reserves for these properties 
judgment regarding status of in progress wells on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each in progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting 
cumulative costs on in progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known 
if an in progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful often referred to as a dry hole prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we write off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and impairments expense  a component of exploration costs 
costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred 
occasionally  we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we leave the well classified as in progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent geological and geophysical and engineering data obtained 
at the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well s productive status  the well is removed from the in progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded 
asset retirement obligations our asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to oil and gas properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the statement of operations 
during  we had an upward revision of our estimated asset retirement obligations by million based on a review of current plugging and abandonment costs 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion expense 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of o ur wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates

in december  the sec released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require companies to report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor  file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than year end prices 
in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance to align the reserve estimation and disclosure requirements within generally accepted accounting principles with the final rule 
all of these rule changes became effective december  we have adopted these changes and conformed our reserve estimation and disclosure practices in accordance with the guidance contained in the releases 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities vies 
this new guidance revises previous guidance by replacing the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a vie with a qualitative approach focused on identifying which enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the righ t to receive benefits that could be significant to the entity 
in addition  this guidance requires reconsideration of whether an entity is a vie when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk  as a group  lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
it also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie and additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  accordingly  we will adopt the provisions of the new guidance in the first quarter of we are c urrently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe our strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a decline in the price per bbl of oil and a 
decline in the price per mcf of gas from year end would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending december  by million 
from time to time  we utilize commodity derivatives  consisting primarily of swaps  floors and collars to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
when using swaps to hedge our oil and natural gas production  we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract generally nymex futures prices  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
when purchasing floors  we receive a fixed price put strike price if the market price falls below the put strike price for the respective commodity 
if the market price is greater than the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
costless collars are a co mbination of puts and calls  and contain a fixed floor price put strike price and ceiling price call strike price 
if the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  no payments are due from either party 
the commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
we do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes 
in addition to commodity derivatives  we may  from time to time  sell a portion of our gas production under short term contracts at fixed prices 
the decision to initiate or terminate commodity hedges is made by management based on its expectation of future market price movements 
we have no set goals for the percentage of our production we hedge and we do not use any formulas or triggers in deciding when to initiate or terminate a hedge 
if we enter into swaps or collars and the floating market price at the settlement date is higher than the fixed price or the fixed ceiling price  we will forego revenue we would have otherwise received 
if we terminate a swap  collar or floor because we anticipate future increases in market prices  we may be exposed to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
the following summarizes information concerning our net positions in open commodity derivatives applicable to periods subsequent to december  the settlement prices of commodity derivatives are based on nymex futures prices 
swaps oil gas bbls price mmbtu a price production period st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter a one mmbtu equals one mcf at a btu factor of  in march  we terminated certain fixed priced oil swaps covering  barrels at a price of from january through december  resulting in an aggregate loss of approximately million  which will be paid to the counterparty monthly as the applicable contracts are settled 
interest rates we are exposed to interest rate risk on our long term debt with a variable interest rate 
at december   our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million  based on current market quotes 
we estimate that the hypothetical change in the fair value of our long term debt resulting from a basis point change in interest rates would be approximately million 
based on our outstanding variable rate indebtedness at december  of million  a change in interest rates of basis points would affect annual interest payments by million
