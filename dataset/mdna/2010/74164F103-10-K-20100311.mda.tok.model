as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  on july   we completed a merger of rhapsody acquisition corp 
and former primoris 
unless specifically noted otherwise  as used throughout this management s discussion and analysis section  primoris  the company or we  our  or us refers to the business  operations and financial results of former primoris prior to  and primoris subsequent to  the closing of the merger on july   between rhapsody and former primoris as the context requires 
rhapsody refers to the operations or financial results of rhapsody acquisition corp 
prior to the closing of the merger 
the july merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition 
under this method of accounting  we were treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes 
this determination was primarily based on the operations and management of former primoris comprising the ongoing operations and management of the company after the merger 
in accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances  the merger was considered to be a capital transaction in substance 
accordingly  for accounting purposes  the merger was treated as the equivalent of former primoris issuing stock for our net assets  accompanied by a recapitalization 
our pre merger net assets are stated at historical cost  with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded 
we provide services in the following two segments construction services segment the construction services segment specializes in a range of services that include designing  building installing  replacing  repairing rehabilitating and providing management services for construction related projects 
our services include providing installation of underground pipeline  cable and conduits for entities in the petroleum  petrochemical and water industries  providing installation and maintenance of industrial facilities for entities in the petroleum  petrochemical and water industries  and providing installation of complex commercial and industrial cast in place structures 
providing large earthwork and site development  site remediation and mining support services  and since the acquisition of jcg  services also include heavy civil construction projects  including highway and bridge construction  concrete paving  levee construction  airport runway and taxiway construction and marine facility construction 
engineering segment the engineering group specializes in designing  supplying and installing high performance furnaces  heaters  burner management systems  and related combustion and process technologies for clients in the oil refining  petrochemical  and power generation industries 
it also furnishes turnkey project management with the technical expertise and the ability to deliver custom engineering solutions worldwide 
outlook in  we experienced a significant reduction in revenues  especially in our california industrial and florida water markets  as we were affected by the economic downturn and volatile capital markets 
many of our customers reduced spending and the awarding of new contracts in  and we expect that economic conditions will remain challenging for the next few quarters 
as a result  while we expect the first half of to be less robust than seen in prior years  we remain positive about the long term opportunities in the industries we serve 
constructions services west our legacy business is focused primarily on infrastructure projects in california 
we anticipate that our utility customers will continue their efforts to improve their underground pipeline and cable and conduit projects  however  if economic conditions worsen  spending on these projects could be reduced 
activity in industrial above ground projects will remain at reduced levels for the next several quarters as the economic slowdown has reduced the need for additional power plants and the fluctuating oil prices have put pressure on refinery margins and refinery capital projects 
while currently at reduced levels  we expect a recovery and longer term growth in this sector 
in addition  demand in this sector could increase significantly depending on the impact of renewable energy initiatives 
california renewable portfolio standards require that one third of energy usage in the state be from renewable sources by since current estimates are that to of the state s energy meets the renewable portfolio standards  significant potential opportunities exist 
in addition  certain portions of the american recovery and reinvestment act arra of may increase demand for our services 
the arra includes incentives for renewable energy in the form of grants  tax cuts  tax credits and loans 
at this time  we cannot predict the timing of these projects that would implement the renewable standards or incentive programs 

table of contents construction services east the economic downturn significantly reduced the revenues of our water and wastewater facility construction company in  which is our largest contributor of revenues in the state of florida 
while there may be a positive impact of the arra on this market segment in  we anticipate that significant improvements may not occur until there is an improvement in the residential housing market in the southeastern united states 
with the acquisition of jcg in december  we anticipate an increase in primoris revenues in in calendar  revenues for jcg were approximately million  and based on jcg s backlog and the status of its projects  we anticipate no reduction in that revenue level in the general economic climate will impact the future level of highway construction in jcg s markets  and there can be no assurance that contract awards in will allow jcg to maintain that level in future years 
we believe that the infrastructure needs in the gulf coast region will provide us with a long term growth opportunity 
engineering our product engineering segment experienced a significant decline in as our customers reacted to the reduced price of oil compared to and a general slowdown in energy usage 
we anticipate continuing market uncertainty during  however  we expect reasonable market growth in non us areas  primarily in asia 
we believe that the operational improvements provided by high performance heaters can provide future opportunities in this segment 
conclusion in  many of our customers reduced capital spending as a result of the recession and capital markets volatility 
it is uncertain when these current unfavorable economic and market conditions will improve  or if they will deteriorate further in the near term 
while some of these issues are expected to persist in the first half of  we are optimistic that with our greater size and available resources  as a result of the jcg acquisition  we are positioned to capitalize on what we believe will be a stronger operating environment in the second half of and into while we increased our gross margin as a percentage of revenues in compared to  we believe that in the near term  margins may decline as competitors bid projects more aggressively in order to maintain their revenue level and cash flow 
in addition  quarterly gross margins may be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions and project delays 
we expect that over the long term we can maintain and improve our margins based on the expected growth opportunities in our markets and our ability to benefit from our increased scale of operations 
in  we will continue to focus on those aspects of our business that we can control 
those aspects include the margins we accept on projects that we bid  our management of cash including collection of receivables  our emphasis on safety programs and quality and our continuing management of all levels of cost 
we expect to maintain a strong competitive position with existing customers and in our current markets 
we will continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions and investments in order to grow our geographic area of operations and services 
while we cannot predict the timing or the overall impact of the growth opportunities  especially in light of the current economic downturn and volatile financial markets  we believe that we have the capability and expertise to continue our growth and capitalize on opportunities in the markets that we serve 
material trends and uncertainties we generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects 
the award of these contracts is dependent on a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
business in the construction industry is cyclical 
we depend in part on spending by companies in the energy  and oil and gas industries  as well as on municipal water and wastewater customers 
over the past several years  both our construction services and engineering segments have benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities and from the strength of the oil and gas industry 
economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts in any particular period 

table of contents we and our customers are operating in a challenging business environment in light of the economic downturn and weak capital markets 
we are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic and market conditions may have on them 
we have experienced reduced spending by our customers in late and throughout  which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions  and we anticipate that these negative conditions will continue to affect demand for our services in the near term until conditions improve 
however  we believe that most of our customers  some of whom are regulated utilities  remain financially stable in general and will be able to continue with their business plans in the long term without substantial constraints 
seasonality and cyclicality our revenues and results of operations can be subject to seasonal and other variations 
these variations are influenced by weather  customer spending patterns  bidding seasons  project schedules and timing and holidays 
typically  our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold  snowy or wet conditions cause delays 
the second quarter is typically better than the first  as some projects begin  but continued cold and wet weather can often impact second quarter productivity 
the third quarter is typically the best of the year  as a greater number of projects are underway and weather is more accommodating to work on projects 
generally  revenues during the fourth quarter of the year are lower than the third quarter but higher than the second quarter 
many projects are completed in the fourth quarter and revenues often are impacted positively by customers seeking to spend their capital budget before the end of the year  however  the holiday season and inclement weather sometimes can cause delays and thereby reduce revenues and increase costs 
additionally  our industry can be highly cyclical 
as a result  our volume of business may be adversely affected by declines or delays in new projects in various geographic regions in the united states 
project schedules  in particular in connection with larger  longer term projects  can also create fluctuations in the services provided  which may adversely affect us in a given period 
the financial condition of our customers and their access to capital  variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular period  regional  national and global economic and market conditions  timing of acquisitions  the timing and magnitude of acquisition assimilation costs  interest rate fluctuations and other factors may also materially affect our periodic results 
accordingly  our operating results for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that can be expected for any other period

segment results the following discussion describes the significant factors contributing to the results of our two operating segments 
construction services segment revenue and gross profit for the construction services segment for the years ending december   and were as follows thousands of revenue thousands of revenue thousands of revenue construction services revenue gross profit construction services segment revenues decreased by million  or for compared to as a result of decreases in our california industrial business of million and our florida water and wastewater construction company of million 
these decreases were due primarily to the substantial completion of refinery and water and wastewater construction projects in which were not replaced with new projects in as the general economy caused potential customers to delay construction projects 
in addition  the impact of the work slowdown and demobilizations at the richmond refinery project  as discussed in the backlog section below  also had an impact on expected revenues for the california industrial business 
the revenue reduction was partially offset by revenue increases of million in california underground projects  including pipeline and cable and conduit projects as well as an increase of million of revenues from the jcg and cravens acquisitions 
construction services segment gross profit increased by million  or  for compared to the increase resulted from improved margins as a percentage of revenue to in from in  as well as the addition of new subsidiaries at the end of  partially offset by reduced profits in the refining sector because of lower revenues  and lower revenues and profits obtained from third party equipment rentals 

table of contents revenue for the construction services segment increased by million  or  for compared to this revenue increase was led primarily by a million increase in construction services for industrial facilities primarily in the refining industry as customers increased their capacity and upgraded their infrastructure in an environment of increasing worldwide petroleum pricing 
the revenue increase was offset by reductions of revenue of million primarily in pipeline  water and wastewater and cable and conduit underground projects and cast in place structure projects reflecting significant work completed at the end of and early  thus affecting revenue comparisons 
construction services segment gross profit increased by million  or  for compared to the increase resulted from both increased revenue and improved margins as a percent of revenue to in from in of the million gross profit increase  approximately million was due to increased revenues and million was due to the improved gross profit percentage 
the primary reasons for the gross profit margin increase were changes from lower margin water and wastewater and underground and structure projects to higher margin industrial projects in the petroleum and power industry 
engineering segment revenue and gross profit for the engineering segment for the years ended december   and were as follows thousands of revenue thousands of revenue thousands of revenue engineering segment revenue gross profit engineering segment revenue decreased by million  or  for compared to the revenue decrease was primarily the result of major alliance work and a major process plant being completed in alliance projects generated revenue in compared to million in engineering segment gross profit increased by million  or  for compared to the increase resulted from increased margin on a major project in thailand and successful completion of a major process plant  partially offset by reduced gross profit margins in alliance work 
revenue increased by million  or  for compared to the primary reason for the increase was the affect of an alliance agreement we made with a major client in november alliance projects generated million in revenue in compared to million in engineering segment gross profit declined by million  or  for compared to the decrease was the result of a significant decrease in the gross profit percentage  which declined to of revenue in from in at the gross profit margin  the gross profit impact from the increase in revenues for was million while the gross profit margin decrease reduced profitability by million 
in  we reversed gross profit on certain alliance projects by million and we recognized a lower gross profit percentage on a million project which was completed in in addition  at the unusually high revenue levels for the segment  we allocated a greater percentage of general and administrative expenses to cost of sales  reducing the gross profit margin 
we expect that the gross profitability in this segment will trend toward higher historical levels in segment reporting for as a result of the acquisition of jcg  management will change primoris reportable segments effective on january  the three new segments will be construction services east  construction services west and engineering 
the construction services east segment will incorporate the jcg construction services business  located primarily in the southern united states  specializing in highway  industrial and environmental projects and will include the current construction services businesses located in the gulf coast region of the united states  which includes cardinal contractors  inc  cardinal mechanical and cravens services  inc the newly formed construction services west segment will include the construction services performed in the western united states  primarily in the state of california 
the current engineering segment will remain unchanged 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  for compared to the increase was due primarily to various factors  including million for acquisition expenses related to the jcg and cravens acquisition due diligence efforts  a lower allocation of million of general and administrative expenses to costs of sales primarily in our engineering segments due to lower revenue levels in in addition  expenses increased by million reflecting additional public company expenses  including increases in directors fees  audit fees  sarbanes oxley compliance costs  consultant fees  legal fees and payroll

merger related stock expense on february   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with former primoris and certain stockholders of former primoris merger agreement 
in connection with the merger agreement  we entered into agreements with two foreign managers that called for the issuance of  shares of our common stock 
in accordance with asc topic compensation stock compensation  we recognized million of non cash expenses and recorded an increase to additional paid in capital 
the issuance of the shares was a non recurring event directly related to the consummation of the merger and therefore  the entire value of the shares at july  was taken as a charge to earnings 
the merger agreement provided for the issuance of additional earn out shares to the former primoris stockholders for both and financial results 
in  we achieved the financial performance target  and in march  we issued  shares to the former primoris stockholders 
we also recorded an expense of million for the  shares issued to the two foreign members

in december  we made the decision to record a million other than temporary impairment of our investment in arb arendal because of a client dispute with an uncertain outcome  resulting in a net loss of million for the year 
in the second quarter of  we made advances to arb arendal of million and we reserved the full amount of these advances 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold our investment in arb arendal to our partner for a minimal sum  and we received repayment of our million advance 
foreign exchange gain for and and foreign exchange loss for reflect currency exchange fluctuations of the united states dollar compared to the canadian dollar 
our contracts in calgary  canada are sold based on united states dollars  but a portion of the work is paid for with canadian dollars  which has created a currency exchange difference 
interest income decreased for and compared to as a result of declining interest rates and our decision to invest our excess cash balances in treasury bills and certificate of deposits cd s purchased through the cdars certificate of deposit account registry service rather than commercial paper

with the change in tax status  our effective tax rate for the year ended december  and december  was and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included the impact of a million tax benefit for establishing our beginning deferred tax assets 
in the years prior to  as an s corporation we had no provision for federal income tax and only minimal provision for state income tax

the fixed assets  consisting mainly of construction equipment  were sold locally or repatriated in related assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses were insignificant at and for the years ended december   and critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available  is dependent on future events  or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
often  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting  the allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives of property and equipment  fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long lived asset impairments  self insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
fixed price contracts fixed price contracts carry certain inherent risks  including underestimation of costs  problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts  which may result in uneven and irregular results 
unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract 
to the extent that original cost estimates are modified  estimated costs to complete increase  delivery schedules are delayed  or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded  cash flow  revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be overstated or understated 
revenue recognition we typically structure contracts as unit price  time and material  fixed price or cost plus fixed fee 
we believe that our operating results should be evaluated over a time horizon during which major contracts in progress are completed and change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and cost recoveries and other claims are negotiated and realized 
we recognize revenue on the percentage of completion method for all of the types of contracts described in the paragraph above 
under the percentage of completion method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  and the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price change associated with such scope change 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than costs related to the unapproved change order 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on the consolidated balance sheets 
unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers 
we consider claims to be amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in asc topic formerly referred to as sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the affect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred income tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  in the judgment of our management  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including recent financial operations  projected future taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and the length of tax asset carryforward periods 
the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions 
if we subsequently determine that the carrying value of these assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 

table of contents effective january   the company also adopted accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as set forth in the accounting guidance asc topic until july   former primoris was taxed as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code and similar codes in states in which former primoris was subject to taxation  which meant that income was taxed for federal income tax purposes to the stockholders 
after the merger  the combined entity became taxable as a c corporation  which changed the level of taxation of former primoris from that of its stockholders to that of the company 
for the twelve months ended december   we computed our provision for income taxes using a tax rate  which reflects the rate necessary to bring the year to date provision for income taxes in line with the estimated annual effective tax rate of 
our deferred income tax provision in included approximately million in net deferred tax benefits resulting from the recognition of beginning deferred tax assets  with realization expected primarily in goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur 
in performing these assessments  management relies on various factors  including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable transactions and other market data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may be overstated 
we elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill 
when testing for goodwill impairment  we follow the guidance prescribed in asc topic intangibles goodwill and other formerly referred to as sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
first  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgets discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows 
other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
disruptions to our business  such as end market conditions  protracted economic weakness  unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future 
as further discussed in note business combinations of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  primarily as a result of the acquisition of jcg in december  the balance of goodwill increased to million as of december  compared to million as of december  long lived assets assets held and used by the company  primarily property  plant and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
we perform undiscounted operation cash flow analyses to determine if impairment exists 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use  we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
the calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 

table of contents reserve for uninsured risks estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to material uninsured risks 
significant judgments by us and reliance on third party experts are utilized in determining probable and or reasonably estimable amounts to be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements 
the results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which the changes are determined 
we self insure worker s compensation claims to a certain level 
we maintained a self insurance reserve totaling approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  our accruals are based on judgment  the probability of losses  and where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel 
the amount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheets 
actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves 
liquidity and capital resources during the past two years  global market and economic conditions have been volatile and have had an adverse impact on financial markets in general 
many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers resulting in severely diminished liquidity and credit availability 
at this time  the extent to which these conditions will persist is unclear 
at this time  the company s cost and availability of funding has not been adversely affected by the credit markets  and we do not expect it to be materially impacted in the near future 
to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our cash or cash equivalents or funds under our credit facility  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our cash  cash equivalents and funds under our credit facility will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
we continue to have borrowing capacity for our foreseeable needs based on our current cash flow forecast 
we currently have a million credit facility which expires october   under which we can issue letters of credit for up to million 
we also have a credit facility of million  which expires october  additionally  the company has a million canadian dollars facility for commercial letters of credit in canada with an expiration date of december  as of december  and  total commercial letters of credit outstanding under this credit facility totaled million and million  respectively

the decrease in restricted cash was related to project completions causing the release of retentions 
the decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings were principally due to the progress and completion status of projects 
the decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings derived from timing of costs incurred versus our contractual ability to bill our customers 
as of december   accounts receivable represented of total assets versus in accounts payable represented of the total liability as opposed to in this reflects the impact from the acquisition of two subsidiaries in late which strengthened our balance sheet position going forward

equipment operating leases with a balance of million at december   including million resulting from the december  acquisition of jcg 
in the ordinary course of our business  we may be required by our customers to post surety bid or completion bonds in connection with services that we provide 
at december  we had million in outstanding bonds  which includes million resulting from the december  acquisition of jcg  backlog in the industries in which we operate  backlog can be considered an indicator of potential future performance because it represents a portion of the future revenue stream 
different companies in our industry define backlog differently 
we consider backlog as the anticipated revenue from the uncompleted portions of existing contracts 
we calculate backlog differently for different types of contracts 
for our fixed price and fixed unit price contracts  we include the full remaining portion of the contract in our calculation 
since their ultimate revenue amount is difficult to determine  we do not include unit price  time and equipment  time and materials and cost plus contracts in the calculation of backlog 
most fixed price contracts may be terminated by our customers on relatively short notice 
in the event of a project cancellation  we may be reimbursed for certain costs  but typically we have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in backlog 
projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time 
as of december   our total backlog was million representing an increase of million  or  from million as of december  backlog from the december  jcg acquisition represented million of this increase 
excluding the jcg backlog  backlog at december  was million  which increased by million from september   but represented a decrease of million from december  we expect that approximately of the total backlog at december   will be recognized as revenue during 
table of contents backlog by operating segment at december   and was as follows segment amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage dollars in millions construction services engineering includes backlog of million as a result of the december  jcg acquisition 
in july  a judge s ruling following opposition from environmental groups in the state of california halted the chevron corporation richmond refinery project in california 
chevron filed an appeal to overturn the judge s order 
the future of the project remains in question until the appeals court can decide the issues 
included in the company s backlog for this project at december  amounted to million  compared to million as of december  backlog should not be considered a comprehensive indicator of future revenues  as a significant portion of our revenues are derived from projects that are not part of a backlog calculation 
during  approximately million of revenue million attributable to primoris and million attributable to jcg during the calendar year was generated by projects completed under master service agreements  time and material contracts  and fixed unit price contracts 
effects of inflation and changing prices our operations are affected by increases in prices  whether caused by inflation or other economic factors 
we attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor  equipment  fuel and materials through price escalation provisions in certain major contracts or by considering the estimated effect of such increases when bidding or pricing new work or by entering into back to back contracts with suppliers and subcontractors 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to risks related to market conditions 
these risks primarily include fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
we may seek to manage these risks through the use of financial derivative instruments 
these instruments may include foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps 
we do not execute transactions or use financial derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into transactions with counter parties that are generally financial institutions in a matter to limit significant exposure with any one party 
as of december   primoris had five derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging future currency exchange in canadian dollars 
the contracts enable primoris to purchase canadian dollars before certain dates in at certain exchange rates 
these contracts expire in january  february  april and june the related canadian dollars purchased are two contracts for million cad each and one purchase and one sales contract for million cad  and one contract for million cad 
the related gain or loss on these contracts is not significant at december  we intend to continue to hedge foreign currency risks in those situations where we believe such transactions are prudent 
at december   our long term debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate instruments 
the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  short term investments  notes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities shown in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value at december   due to the generally short maturities of these items 
at december   we invested primarily in short term dollar denominated bank deposits and other to day certificates of deposits cds through the cdars certificate of deposit account registry service process to provide fdic backing of the cds 
we expect to hold our investments to maturity
