item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are developing high resolution miniature display and imaging engines based upon our proprietary picop display engine platform 
our technology platform utilizes our expertise in two dimensional micro electrical mechanical systems mems  lasers  optics and electronics to create a high quality video or still image from a small form factor device with lower power needs than conventional display technologies 
our strategy is to develop and supply a proprietary display engine called picop to potential oem customers who will embed them into a variety of consumer and automotive products 
the primary objective for consumer applications is to provide users of mobile devices with a large screen viewing experience produced by a small embedded projector 
mobile devices may include cell phones  pdas  gaming consoles and other consumer electronics products 
these potential products would allow users to watch movies  play videos  display images  and other data onto a variety of flat or curved surfaces 
we recently launched the sale of a small accessory projector that is the first commercial product based on the picop display engine 
the accessory projector can display images from a variety of video sources including cell phones  portable media players  pdas  gaming consoles  laptop computers  digital cameras  and other consumer electronics products 
we have been selling the accessory projector in limited quantity through our asian and european based distributors 
in march  we announced the sales launch of the accessory projector to customers in the united states 
we plan to add distribution channels as the production capacity for our manufacturing partner  green laser suppliers and other component suppliers increases 
the picop with some modification could be embedded into a vehicle or integrated into a portable standalone aftermarket device to create a high resolution head up display hud that could project point by point navigation  critical operational  safety and other information important to the driver or pilot 
the picop could be further modified to be embedded into a pair of glasses to provide the mobile user with a see through or occluded personal display to view movies  play games or access other content 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to incur a substantial loss during the fiscal year ending december  key accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the display and image capture industries  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following key accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize contract revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee  and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
our revenue contracts generally include a statement of the work we are to complete and the total fee we will earn from the contract 
when we begin work on the contract and at the end of each accounting period  we estimate the labor  material and other cost required to complete the statement of work compared to cost incurred to date 
we use information provided by our technical team  project mangers  vendors  outside consultants and others to develop our cost estimates 
since our contracts generally require some level of technology development to complete  the actual cost required to complete a statement of work can vary from our estimates 
we have developed processes that allow us to make reasonable estimates of the cost to complete a contract 
historically  we have made only immaterial revisions in the estimates to complete the contract at each reporting period 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion and actual revenue and cost become certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in the future  revisions in these estimates could significantly impact recognized revenue in any one reporting period 
if the us government cancels a contract  we would receive payment for work performed and costs committed to prior to the cancellation 
we recognize product revenue and contract revenue on the sale of prototype units and evaluation kits  upon acceptance of the deliverables by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period  after which there are no rights of return 
in the future  we expect to enter into distribution relationships which involve the distributor taking inventory positions and reselling to multiple customers 
with these distributor relationships  we would not recognize revenue until the distributors sell the product through to their end user customers 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts and producing prototype units  evaluation kits  and rov units 
cost of revenue for the showwx includes the direct costs of manufacturing products sold to customers 
because we are in the early phase of showwx production and the design and manufacturing processes are not yet sufficiently mature to support commercial production  we classify overhead cost allocated to the showwx as research and development expense 
when the showwx design and production processes reach a level to support commercial production  all manufacturing costs will be included in cost of revenue 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract or producing prototype units  evaluation kits  and rov and showwx units 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our manufacturing and technical capabilities and capacity 
our overhead  which includes the costs of procuring  inspecting and storing material  facility and depreciation costs  is allocated to inventory  cost of product revenue  cost of contract revenue  and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct material purchased for the respective activity 
losses on uncompleted contracts 
we establish an allowance for estimated losses if the estimated cost to complete a contract exceeds the remaining contract value 
the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first determined 
we determine the estimated cost to complete a contract through a detailed review of the work to be completed  the resources available to complete the work and the technical difficulty of the remaining work 
if the revised estimated cost to complete the contract is higher than the total contract revenue  the entire contract loss is recognized 
the actual cost to complete a contract can vary significantly from the estimated cost  due to a variety of factors including availability of technical staff  availability of materials and technical difficulties that arise during a project 
most of our development contracts are cost plus fixed fee type contracts 
under these types of contracts  we are not required to spend more than the contract value to complete the contracted work 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible receivables  including accounts receivable  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and receivables from related parties 
we review several factors in determining the allowances including the customer s and related party s past payment history and financial condition 
if the financial condition of our customers or the related parties with whom we have receivables were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis 
we review several factors in determining the market value of our inventory including evaluating the replacement cost of the raw materials and the net realizable value of the finished goods 
if we do not achieve our targeted sales prices  if market conditions for our components or products were to decline or if we do not achieve our sales forecast  additional reductions in the carrying value of the inventory would be required 
investments available for sale and fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions  the authoritative guidance establishes a three level fair value hierarchy  with level being observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets spanning to level where inputs are unobservable by market participants outside of the company and must be estimated using assumptions we develop 
we use market data  assumptions and risks we believe market participants would use in measuring the fair value of the asset or liability  including the risks inherent in the inputs and the valuation techniques 
estimating valuation inputs and selecting and applying valuation methods may require significant judgments by management 
changes in the estimated inputs and valuation methods could result in materially different values  credits and charges presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the investments are stated at fair value and classified as cash and cash equivalents or current investment securities available for sale on the consolidated balance sheets with unrealized gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
we classify investment securities available for sale purchased with days or less remaining until contractual maturity as cash equivalents on the balance sheet in cash and cash equivalents 
interest income  realized gains and losses  and other than temporary impairments are recognized in the period earned or incurred  and presented separately in the consolidated statements of operations 
changes in the fair values of derivatives are realized in the period of remeasurement and recorded in gain loss on derivative instruments  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
employee share based compensation 
we issue share based compensation to employees in the form of options exercisable into our common stock and restricted or unrestricted shares of our common stock 
we account for equity instruments issued to employees using the straight line attribution method of allocating the fair value of share based compensation expense over the requisite service period of the related award 
the value of restricted or unrestricted shares is determined using the fair value method  which is based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on the date of grant 
the value of options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model with estimates of option lives  stock price volatilities and interest rates  then expensed over the periods of service allowing for pre vest forfeitures 
this widely accepted method results in reasonable option values and interperiod expense allocation  and comparability across companies 
changes in the estimated inputs or using other option valuation methods could result in materially different option values and share based compensation expense 
the key accounting policies described above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for us to apply judgment or make estimates 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result to our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our accounting policies  and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles  are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues  or income from continuing operations over the three most recent fiscal years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands government revenue   commercial revenue   total contract revenue   we earn contract revenue from performance on development contracts with the us government and commercial customers and from the sale of prototype units and evaluation kits based on our picop display engine 
our contract revenue in a particular period is dependent upon when we enter into a contract  the value of the contracts we have entered into  and the availability of technical resources to perform work on the contracts 
our contract revenue from sales of prototype units and evaluation kits may vary substantially due to the timing of orders from customers and potential constraints on resources 
contract revenue from government and commercial contracts was substantially lower during than in due to reduced contract activity and lower beginning backlog in compared to the previous year 
we expect that we will have fewer opportunities to enter into new development contracts as we move closer to the commercialization of products based on our picop display engine 
as long as most of our revenue is earned from performance on development contracts  we believe there may be a high degree of variability in revenue from one period to another 
in july  we entered into a month million subcontract with lockheed martin corporation to supply two full color  daylight readable  see through display systems as part of the us government s urban leader tactical response  awareness visualization program 
lockheed martin holds a prime contract with the us government for development of the soldier worn display 
our backlog of development contracts at december  was  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts compared to  in government contracts and  in commercial contracts at december  the decrease in backlog from is primarily attributed to completion of government and commercial development contracts in and reduced contract activity as we move closer to the commercialization of products based on our picop display engine 
we plan to complete the entire contract backlog during product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands bar code revenue  pico projector revenue n a total product revenue   bar code revenue includes the sales of rov and our discontinued flic bar code scanners 
the decrease in bar code revenue for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due to decreased purchasing volume of small and mid sized businesses as a result of the global economic conditions 
as a result of this downturn we have reduced our sales and marketing efforts on the bar code product 
we do not expect to increase our investment in the bar code product in the future and we are currently evaluating opportunities to sell our existing bar code inventory and sell or license our bar code production capability and technology 
pico projector revenue includes the sales of showwx which was launched in september our quarterly revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and availability of components and raw materials 
the backlog of product orders at december  was approximately million  compared to  at december   all of which is scheduled for delivery during cost of contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of contract revenue   cost of contract revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts and producing prototype units and evaluation kits 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract or producing prototype units and evaluation kits 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
cost of contract revenue is determined both by the level of direct costs incurred and by the level of indirect costs incurred in operating and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
both the direct and indirect costs can fluctuate substantially from period to period 
the cost of contract revenue as a percentage of revenue was higher in than in as a result of differences in the cost mix of the contracts during those periods 
the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the contract cost mix and the levels of direct and indirect costs incurred 
however  over longer periods of time we expect modest fluctuations in the cost of contract revenue  as a percentage of contract revenue 
cost of product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of product revenue   cost of product revenue includes the direct costs of manufacturing products sold to customers  and for rov it also includes the allocated indirect cost of manufacturing overhead 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in the manufacture of these products 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
we are in the early phase of showwx production and the design and manufacturing processes are not yet sufficiently mature to support commercial production 
our costs to produce showwx units during were substantially higher than product revenue 
we classified overhead cost allocated to the showwx as research and development expense in when the showwx design and production processes reach a level to support commercial production  all manufacturing costs will be included in cost of revenue 
our overhead  which includes the costs of procuring  inspecting and storing material  facility and depreciation costs  is allocated to inventory  cost of product revenue  cost of contract revenue  and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct material purchased for the respective activity 
during and  we expensed approximately  and  respectively  of manufacturing overhead associated with production capacity in excess of production requirements 
the increase in cost of product revenue for  compared to  was primarily attributed to increased inventory write downs compared to the prior year 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the product mix  the level of overhead expense and the volume of direct materials purchased 
the increase in the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue in compared to the same period in was due to a higher cost structure for the showwx product and an increase in inventory write downs for the rov product 
in  cost of product revenue included  of inventory write downs compared to  for the same period in research and development expense 
change change in thousands research and development    research and development expense consists of compensation related costs of employees and contractors engaged in internal research and product development activities  laboratory operations  outsourced development and processing work  and other operating expenses 
in addition  we allocate our research and development resources based on the business opportunity of the available projects  the skill mix of the resources available and the contractual commitments we have made to customers 
in order to accelerate our time to market and because contract revenue was lower for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  we directed more of our research and development work to internally funded projects compared to the same period last year 
we have increased spending in research and development as part of our strategy to accelerate the time to market for products based on the picop 
the increase in cost is primarily attributable to increases in payroll costs and contracted services 
we believe that a substantial level of continuing research and development expense will be required to develop additional commercial products using the light scanning technology 
accordingly  we anticipate our level of research and development spending will continue to be substantial 
sales  marketing  general and administrative expense

during the period ended december   based on the length of the historical duration of failed slars auctions  the significant uncertainty of the prospective duration of inactivity  and lack of liquidity in the slars market  we determined that the estimated fair values of the slars were less than par value and the impairments were other than temporary 
we used a discounted cash flow model  with rates adjusted for liquidity  to determine the estimated fair values of the slars as of december  we recorded an impairment of investment securities  available for sale of  for the period ended december  there were no adjustments to the fair value of the slars during gain loss on derivative instruments  net

in july  warrants to purchase  shares of common stock expired unexercised 
we record changes in the fair values of the warrants in the statement of operations each period 
we valued the remaining warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at december  using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions expected volatility of  expected dividend yield of  risk free interest rates ranging from to  and contractual lives ranging from years to years 
the change in value of the warrants of  in was recorded as a non operating loss and is included in gain loss on derivative instruments  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
income taxes 
no provision for income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses from inception through december  at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  we have research and development tax credits of million 
the net operating loss carry forwards and research and development credits available to offset future taxable income  if any  will expire in varying amounts from to if not previously utilized 
in certain circumstances  as specified in the internal revenue code  a or more ownership change by certain combinations of our shareholders during any three year period would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we have determined that such a change of ownership occurred during and that the annual utilization of loss carry forwards generated through the period of that change will be limited to approximately  an additional change of ownership occurred in and the annual limitation for losses generated in is approximately million 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits at december  or at december  we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense

at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and investment securities  available for sale  which included million in auction rate securities ars 
there is currently no established primary orderly market for these ars 
if we were required to sell them in a short period of time we may receive less than their current estimated fair values 
however  based on our current operating plan and ability to access our million held in cash and cash equivalents as of december   we do not expect to be required to sell these securities materially below their current estimated fair value 
based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations through the first quarter of we will require additional cash to fund our operating plan past that time 
we plan to obtain additional cash through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that additional cash will be available or that  if available  it will be available on terms acceptable to us on a timely basis 
if adequate funds are not available on a timely basis we may be required to limit our operations substantially 
this limitation of operations could include delaying development projects resulting in reductions in staff  operating costs  capital expenditures and investment in research and development 
cash used in operating activities totaled million during  compared to million during during  the increased cash outlay was primarily driven by the acceleration of research and development activities on our picop and related technologies for planned picop and other product applications

the final payment on the notes was made in march our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the rate at which we can  directly or through arrangements with original equipment manufacturers  introduce products incorporating our technology and the market acceptance and competitive position of such products 
future operating expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress of research and development programs  the progress in commercialization activities and arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to establish cooperative development  joint venture and licensing arrangements 
in order to maintain our exclusive rights under our license agreement with the university of washington  we are obligated to make royalty payments to the university of washington with respect to the virtual retinal display technology 
if we are successful in establishing original equipment manufacturer co development and joint venture arrangements  we expect our partners to fund certain non recurring engineering costs for technology development and or for product development

this standard sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  identifies the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
the standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after june  we adopted this standard during the quarter ended june  and have evaluated any subsequent events through the date of this filing 
the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

the guidance is effective for revenue arrangements that are entered into or are materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that implementation of this guidance will have on our financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued guidance which allows exclusion of software from the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance if the software is included with tangible products and is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
the guidance becomes effective for revenue arrangements that are entered into or are materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that implementation of this guidance will have on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued guidance which improves disclosures about the measurement of the fair value of financial instruments including the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  the valuation techniques and inputs used  the activity in level fair value measurements  and the transfers between levels   and of the fair value inputs hierarchy 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods ended after december  the adoption of the guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market liquidity risks as of the end of  approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale have variable interest rates or are very short term discount notes traded in active markets 
therefore  we believe our exposure to market and interest rate risks is not material 
the remainder is composed of million par student loan auction rate securities slars fair valued at approximately million 
our slars are investment grade long term bonds  structured with variable interest rate resets  with purchases and sales to be determined via a dutch auction process every days 
they were issued to fund us government guaranteed student loans 
beginning in february  the rapid declines in global credit markets and liquidity  and resultant economic recession  led to insufficient investor bids to clear the slars auctions and fund the secondary slars market 
the issuers then began and continue to pay interest at maximum rates  instead of auction rates  in accordance with the bond terms 
given the adverse credit market conditions and slars short term illiquidity  the fair value of the principal became more sensitive to changes in interest rates and the spread between short and long rates than it was in the pre ars credit marketplace 
as a result  we estimated that the fair value of the slars to be approximately million at december  there were no adjustments to the fair value of the slars during if market conditions worsen  we may have to further adjust the estimated fair value and record additional charges to earnings if we believe the adjustment is other than temporary 
in the event we need immediate access to the funds invested in the slars  we could be required to sell them at an amount below our current carrying value 
any of these events could affect our consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
however  based on market stabilization and strengthening during  we do not expect to be required to sell these securities materially below their current estimated fair values 
our investment policy generally directs that the investment managers should select investments to achieve the following goals principal preservation  adequate liquidity and return 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents and investments available for sale securities portfolio are comprised of short term highly rated money market funds and the slars 
the values of cash equivalents and investment securities  available for sale by maturity date as of december   are as follows amount percent cash and cash equivalents  less than one year  one to two years greater than five years  foreign exchange rate risk all of our development contract payments are made in us dollars 
however  in the future we may enter into development contracts in foreign currencies that may subject us to foreign exchange rate risk 
we intend to enter into foreign currency hedges to offset material exposure to currency fluctuations when we can adequately determine the timing and amounts of the exposure
