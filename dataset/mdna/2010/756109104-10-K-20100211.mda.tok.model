item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general realty income corporation  the monthly dividend company  is a maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust  or reit 
our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations  or ffo  per share 
our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to regional and national retail chains 
we have in house acquisition  leasing  legal  credit research  real estate research  portfolio management and capital markets expertise 
over the past years  realty income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate rental revenue under long term lease agreements primarily to years 
in addition  we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and ffo per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties 
at december   we owned a diversified portfolio of  retail properties  with an occupancy rate of  or  properties occupied and only properties available for lease  leased to different retail chains doing business in separate retail industries  located in states  with over million square feet of leasable space  and with an average leasable retail space per property of approximately  square feet 
of the  properties in the portfolio   or  are single tenant  retail properties and the remaining are multi tenant  distribution and office properties 
at december   of the  single tenant properties   were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term excluding extension options of approximately years 
in addition  at december   our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary  crest net lease  inc crest  had an inventory of three properties valued at million  which are classified as held for sale 
crest was created to buy and sell properties  primarily to individual investors who are involved in tax deferred exchanges under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in addition to the three properties  crest also holds notes receivable of million at december  crest did not acquire any properties in liquidity and capital resources capital philosophy historically  we have met our long term capital needs through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and long term unsecured notes and bonds 
over the long term  we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure 
however  we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time 
we may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties 
in addition  we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us 
conservative capital structure we believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure 
therefore  we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
at december   our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes were billion  or approximately of our total market capitalization of billion 

table of contents we define our total market capitalization at december  as the sum of shares of our common stock outstanding of  multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the nyse of per share on december   or billion  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class d preferred stock of million  aggregate liquidation value par value of per share of the class e preferred stock of million  outstanding notes of billion  and outstanding borrowings of million on our credit facility 
mortgage debt we have no mortgage debt on any of our properties 
million acquisition credit facility in may  we entered into a million revolving  unsecured credit facility that replaced our previous million acquisition credit facility 
the term of our credit facility is for three years  until may  plus two  one year extension options 
under our credit facility  our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the london interbank offered rate  commonly referred to as libor  plus basis points with a facility fee of basis points  for all in drawn pricing of basis points over libor 
we also have other interest rate options available to us 
at december   we had a borrowing capacity of million available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of million at an effective interest rate of 
we expect to use the credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and for other corporate purposes 
any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk 
we have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility  up to million  to a total borrowing capacity of million 
any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility 
cash reserves we are organized to operate as an equity reit that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders  in the form of monthly cash distributions  a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our retail properties 
we intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we intend  however  to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility 
acquisitions during during  we invested million in new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 
these properties are located in five states  contain over  leasable square feet  and are leased with an average lease term of years 
the new properties we acquired are net leased to four different retail chains 
there were no acquisitions by crest in we made fewer portfolio acquisitions in and than in previous years because we felt that preserving our capital resources and maintaining a high level of liquidity until property prices adjusted and the general economy improved was the prudent course of action 
in late  we felt that market conditions had become more attractive for acquisitions  and we currently believe that there are many retail chains  with solid operating concepts  that are in need of capital 
we believe that our solid financial position  strong balance sheet and access to capital give us the ability to expand our acquisition activities in and invest in new retail properties that have the potential to contribute to our earnings 
the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income in a net leased property that is equal to the aggregate base cash flow or  in the case of properties under development  the estimated aggregate base cash flow under the lease for the first year of each lease  divided by the estimated total cost of the properties 
since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent  we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above 

table of contents impact of real estate and credit markets in the commercial retail real estate market  property prices generally continued to decline and lease rates rose throughout and likewise  the us credit markets have experienced significant price volatility  dislocations and liquidity disruptions  which have impacted our access to and cost of capital 
we continue to monitor the commercial retail real estate and us credit markets carefully and  if required  will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly 
see our discussion of risk factors in this annual report 
increases in monthly distributions to common stockholders we have continued our year policy of paying distributions monthly 
monthly distributions per share were increased in january by to 
the increase in january was our th consecutive quarterly increase and the th increase in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the new york stock exchange  or nyse  in in  we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of  three in the amount of  three in the amount of and three in the amount of  totaling 
in december and january  we declared distributions of per share  which were paid in january and will be paid in february  respectively 
the monthly distribution of per share represents a current annualized distribution of per share  and an annualized distribution yield of approximately based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse of on february  although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions  we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions  that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share  or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period 
note redemptions upon their maturity in january  we redeemed  using cash on hand  the million outstanding principal amount of our notes due  or notes 
the notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
we have no debt maturities until march universal shelf registration in march  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec  which is effective for a term of three years  to replace our prior shelf registration statement which was set to expire in april our new shelf registration statement expires in march in accordance with the sec rules  the amount of the securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit 
the securities covered by this registration statement include common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  or any combination of these securities 
we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered 
the specifics of any future offerings  along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered  will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement  or other offering materials  at the time of the offering 
credit agency ratings we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes 
fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s investors service has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s ratings group has assigned a rating of bbb to our senior notes 
all of these ratings have stable outlooks 
we have also been assigned credit ratings on our preferred stock 
fitch ratings has assigned a rating of bbb  moody s has assigned a rating of baa and standard poor s has assigned a rating of bb to our preferred stock 
all of these ratings have stable outlooks 
the credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon  among other things  our results of operations and financial condition 
these ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant 
moreover  a rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold our debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 

table of contents notes outstanding our senior unsecured note obligations consist of the following as of december   sorted by maturity date dollars in millions notes  issued in march and due in march notes  issued in november and due in november notes  issued in september and due in september notes  issued in september and due in september notes  issued in september and due in august bonds  issued in march and due in march all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 
interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually 
all of these notes and bonds contain various covenants  including i a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed  ii a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed  iii a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than times  and iv the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than of our outstanding unsecured debt 
we have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes and bonds was issued 
the following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes  as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes 
these calculations  which are not based on us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  measurements  are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance 
the actual amounts as of december  are note covenants required actual limitation on incurrence of total debt limitation on incurrence of secured debt debt service coverage trailing months x x maintenance of total unencumbered assets of unsecured debt the following table summarizes the maturity of each of our obligations as of december  dollars in millions table of obligations ground ground leases leases paid by paid by year of credit realty our maturity facility notes interest income tenants other totals thereafter totals interest on the credit facility and notes has been calculated based on outstanding balances as of december  through their respective maturity dates 
realty income currently pays the ground lessors directly for the rent under the ground leases 
a majority of this rent is reimbursed to realty income as additional rent from our tenants 
our tenants  who are generally sub tenants under the ground leases  are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases 
in the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent  we are primarily responsible 
other consists of  of commitments under construction contracts and million of contingent payments for tenant improvements and leasing costs 

table of contents our credit facility and note obligations are unsecured 
accordingly  we have not pledged any assets as collateral for these obligations 
preferred stock outstanding in  we issued million shares of class d cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
in may  shares of class d preferred stock became redeemable at our option for per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
dividends on shares of class d preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 
in  we issued million shares of class e cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
beginning december   shares of class e preferred stock are redeemable at our option for per share  plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
dividends on shares of class e preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears 
dividends on our class d and class e preferred stock are current 
no off balance sheet arrangements or unconsolidated investments we have no unconsolidated or off balance sheet investments in variable interest entities or off balance sheet financing  nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments 
additionally  we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
as such  our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of off balance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition 
we continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business  as well as other factors  to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by gaap  many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies 
one of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties 
depreciation of buildings and improvements is generally computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
if we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that years is an appropriate estimate of useful life 
no depreciation has been recorded on crest s properties that are classified as held for sale 
when acquiring a property for investment purposes  we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired with in place operating leases to land  building and improvements  identified intangible assets and liabilities  based in each case on their fair values 
intangible assets and liabilities consist of above market and below market leases  the value of in place leases and tenant relationships 

table of contents another significant judgment must be made as to if  and when  impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
generally  a provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges plus estimated disposition proceeds undiscounted are less than the current book value of the property 
key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates  capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates 
if a property is held for sale  it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value  less estimated cost to sell 
the carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet 
if events should occur that require us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment  it could have a material impact on our results of operations 
the following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december   and rental revenue rental revenue was million for versus million for  an increase of  or 
rental revenue was million in the increase in rental revenue in compared to is primarily attributable to the retail properties acquired by realty income in  which generated  of rent in  the retail properties acquired by realty income in  which generated million of rent in compared to million in  an increase of million  same store rents generated on  properties during the entire years of and  increased by million  or  to million from million  net of a net decrease of million relating to the aggregate of i development properties acquired before that started paying rent in  ii properties that were vacant during part of or  iii properties sold during and and iv lease termination settlements  which in aggregate  totaled million in compared to million in  and a decrease in straight line rent and other non cash adjustments to rent of  in as compared to overall  comparing versus  revenue has been generally flat as we own  properties at december   compared to  properties at december  of the  properties in the portfolio at december    or  are single tenant properties and the remaining are multi tenant  distribution and office properties

percentage rent  which is included in rental revenue  was million in  million in and  in excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of  in and  in 
percentage rent in was less than of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than of rental revenue in our portfolio of retail real estate  leased primarily to regional and national chains under net leases  continues to perform well and provide dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders 
at december   our portfolio of  retail properties was leased with properties available for lease as compared to at december  
table of contents as of february   transactions to lease or sell ten of the properties available for lease at december  were underway or completed 
we anticipate these transactions will be completed during the next several months  although we cannot guarantee that all of these properties can be leased or sold within this period 
it has been our experience that approximately to of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time  however  we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was million in versus million in and million in the increases in depreciation and amortization in and were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in  and  which was partially offset by property sales in these years 
as discussed in the section entitled funds from operations available to common stockholders  depreciation and amortization is a non cash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of ffo 
interest expense interest expense was million in versus million in and million in interest expense decreased in primarily due to lower average outstanding balances and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates 
we redeemed  in november  the million outstanding principal amount of our monthly income senior notes and  in january  the million outstanding principal amount of our notes  both of which contributed to the decrease in average outstanding balances and lower average interest rates on our debt 
in may  as a result of entering into our current credit facility  we incurred million of credit facility origination costs that were capitalized and are being amortized over three years 
at december   million of the million is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet

general portfolio costs include  but are not limited to  insurance  legal  bad debt expense  property inspections and title search fees 
at december   properties were available for lease  as compared to at december  and at december  property expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase in property expenses in is primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance and utilities associated with properties available for lease and an increase in bad debt expense  partially offset by lower property taxes and legal fees

the crest tax benefit includes a benefit of  attributable to amendments of certain prior year state tax returns 
discontinued operations crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties 
consequently  we typically classify properties acquired by crest as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them 
the operation of crest s properties is classified as income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income 
if we decide not to sell a property previously classified as held for sale  the property is reclassified as real estate held for investment 
a property that is reclassified to held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of i its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment  and ii the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell

we have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will generate higher returns  enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio  extend our average remaining lease term  or decrease tenant or industry concentration 
at december   we classified real estate with a carrying amount of million as held for sale on our balance sheet  which includes three properties owned by crest  valued at million 
additionally  we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified  from which we anticipate receiving between million and million in proceeds during the next months 
we intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions  if there are attractive opportunities available 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties 
provisions for impairment on real estate acquired for resale by crest in  provisions for impairment of  were recorded by crest on three retail properties held for sale and two properties which were sold in in  provisions for impairment of million were recorded by crest on three properties held for sale 
no provisions for impairment were recorded by crest in these provisions for impairment adjusted the carrying values to the estimated fair market values of those properties  net of estimated selling costs  and are included in income from discontinued operations  real estate acquired for resale by crest on our consolidated statements of income 

table of contents provisions for impairment on realty income investment properties in  we recorded a provision for impairment of  on one property  which is included in income from discontinued operations  real estate held for investment on our consolidated statement of income for  as the property is held for sale 
no provisions for impairment were recorded in in  we recorded a provision for impairment of  on one property  which is included in income from discontinued operations  real estate held for investment on our consolidated statement of income for  as the property was subsequently sold

the calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties

table of contents funds from operations available to common stockholders ffo ffo for increased by million  or  to million  as compared to million in and million in the following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders which we believe is the most comparable gaap measure to ffo 
also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share dollars in thousands  except per share amounts net income available to common stockholders depreciation and amortization continuing operations discontinued operations depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment gain on sales of land and investment properties continuing operations discontinued operations ffo available to common stockholders ffo per common share basic diluted distributions paid to common stockholders ffo in excess of distributions paid to common stockholders weighted average number of common shares used for computation per share basic diluted we define ffo  a non gaap measure  consistent with the national association of real estate investment trust s definition  as net income available to common stockholders  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a reit s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back non cash items such as depreciation 
the historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight line depreciation of buildings and improvements  which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions  presentations of operating results for a reit  using historical accounting for depreciation  could be less informative 
the use of ffo is recommended by the reit industry as a supplemental performance measure 
in addition  ffo is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility 
presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different reits  although it should be noted that not all reits calculate ffo the same way  so comparisons with other reits may not be meaningful 
furthermore  ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance 
in addition  ffo should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity  of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments 

table of contents other non cash items and capitalized expenditures the following information includes non cash items and capitalized expenditures on existing properties in our portfolio 
these items are not included in the adjustments to net income available to common stockholders to arrive at ffo 
analysts and investors often request this supplemental information 
dollars in thousands amortization of share based compensation amortization of deferred note financing costs crest provisions for impairment provisions for impairment amortization of settlements on treasury lock agreements capitalized leasing costs and commissions capitalized building improvements straight line rent revenue amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in october  january  march  november  march  september  september and september these costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes 
no costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included 
the settlement on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk prevention strategy that we used in and  which correlated to pending issuances of senior note securities 
we have not employed this strategy since a negative amount indicates that our straight line rent was greater than our actual cash rent collected 
impact of inflation tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants sales volumes  increases in the consumer price index typically subject to ceilings  and or fixed increases 
we expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time 
during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent  as provided for in the leases  rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation 
of our  retail properties in the portfolio  approximately or  are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses 
net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation 
inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements for information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives we issue long term notes and bonds  primarily at fixed rates 
we were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at december  we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents the following table presents by year of expected maturity  the principal amounts  average interest rates and fair values as of december  this information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes dollars in millions expected maturity data year of maturity fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt variable rate debt average interest rate on variable rate debt thereafter totals fair value the credit facility expires in may million matures in march million matures in november  million matures in september  million matures in september  million matures in august and million matures in march we base the fair value of the fixed rate debt at december  on indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our notes payable 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates 
all of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates 
our credit facility interest rate is variable 
based on our credit facility balance of million at december   a change in interest rates would change our interest costs by  per year
