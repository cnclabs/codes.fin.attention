item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to present a better understanding of our operations and current business environment 
we are a leading global supplier of products and services to lotteries  and a leading provider of gaming technology and content to other gaming operators worldwide 
we also gain access to technology and pursue global expansion through strategic joint ventures and minority investments 
we report our operations in three business segments printed products group  lottery systems group  and diversified gaming group 
our global instant lottery ticket business  inclusive of our licensed property and prepaid phone card businesses  is included in our printed products group 
our customized lottery software  systems and equipment services and sales are included in our lottery systems group 
our wide area gaming and racing and venue management businesses are included in our diversified gaming group 
in order to provide users of our financial statements better visibility into our revenue streams  beginning with our results for the year ended december  and for all prior periods included herein  we have segregated revenues related to our instant ticket fulfillment services businesses from other service revenues 
our customized lottery software  systems and services  our wide area gaming and our racing systems and services and our venue management business will continue to be categorized as service revenues 
our sales of phone cards  lottery systems and terminals  which we view as pure product sales that are typically non recurring in nature and not subject to multi year supply agreements  will continue to be categorized as sales revenues 
overview we begin the md a with a discussion of the significant factors that have impacted our results of operations during  as well as certain trends  demands  constraints  risks and opportunities that have affected or may affect our financial and operating performance 
for additional information  please refer to the business and risk factor sections and the forward looking statements disclosure included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe that the extraordinarily difficult global economic environment and its impact on consumer spending have negatively impacted our results of operations during nevertheless  we believe that the lottery and wide area gaming businesses are less susceptible to reductions in consumer spending than the destination gaming business and other consumer businesses eg  resort casino venues  which are typically less accessible than lottery and wide area gaming retail outlets 
we estimate that during  total us lottery sales increased by approximately  which compares favorably to the reduction in overall us retail sales and food services during the year reported by the us census bureau 
our revenues in decreased approximately million  or approximately  compared to much of this decrease was attributable to recent contract re pricings discussed in the paragraph below  the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the shift in china instant lottery tickets production to our joint venture with the related financial results recognized by us as equity in earnings of joint ventures but no longer included in our consolidated revenues and expenses 
in  we derived approximately of our total revenues from our operations outside of the us the principal foreign currencies to which we have the most exposure are the euro and the british pound sterling  representing approximately and  respectively  of our non us dollar revenues in some of our lottery products and services have been  and are likely to continue to be  subject to intense price based competition 
over the past several quarters  a number of our larger lottery contracts that were up for renewal have been renewed on less favorable pricing terms and or with increased product and service requirements 
these trends in our lottery business have affected and may continue to affect the number and the profitability of the contracts we win 
our strategy to counter balance these industry trends includes selectively bidding on contracts on a basis that is consistent with our internal rate of return requirements  bundling value added products and services eg  player tracking  loyalty programs and second chance drawings with our core lottery offering and pursuing new marketing initiatives such as expanding distribution to big box stores and other retail outlets 
to help offset this pricing pressure  we have also pursued initiatives to improve our cost structure under our profitability improvement program  resulting in approximately million in savings during given the renewal cycle of our lottery contracts  we do not foresee the kind of large scale contract re pricings over the next two years that we have recently experienced 
moreover  we have recently seen indications that lottery authorities in awarding new contracts are giving more weight in their evaluations to factors other than price 
we believe that the indiana online lottery contract that we recently won is an example of a lottery not simply awarding the contract to the low cost provider 
in the lottery systems business  us lotteries recently agreed to begin cross selling powerball and mega millions lottery games  enabling players in all lottery states to play a big jackpot game four days a week 
we believe that this cross selling will grow the online lottery business by exposing a larger population to these games thereby increasing jackpots  and may only be the first step in expanding and differentiating the products offered by lotteries  potentially leading to higher price points 
in italy  our bidding group comprised of members of our consortium  cln tendered for a new nine year concession to operate the gratta e vinci instant ticket lottery upon the termination of cln s existing concession 
in november  an italian administrative court voided the tender process in a ruling that has been appealed by the italian government 
a hearing on the appeal is expected on march  in the event that the appellate court sustains the lower court ruling  there will likely be a new tender process during which time and for a transitional period thereafter we expect that the existing concession would continue 
in the event that the appellate court reinstates the tender process  we expect the monopoli di stato to promptly award the new concession to our bidding group 
in such an event  we expect that we would be required to make our pro rata share of the upfront payments that would be required of our bidding group  which would be million payable shortly after the award is made and million payable on or about november  under the terms of the tender  assuming our ownership interest in the joint venture entity that holds the new concession remains at 
we incurred additional debt in in part to provide us with sufficient liquidity to make these upfront payments 
we believe that the uncertainty related to the results of the tender process has reduced the rate of instant ticket orders cln has recently received from the italian lottery authority  which may have an adverse effect on cln s results of operations for at least a portion of in addition  we expect that the capitalization and amortization of the significant upfront payments that would be payable by our joint venture as the holder of the new concession will negatively impact the earnings from our share of the joint venture 
we also anticipate that increased competition from the proliferation of other forms of gaming in italy may put pressure on the results of operations of cln or the successor joint venture 
in china  retail sales of csl instant tickets grew approximately in our introduction of the higher priced rmb ticket in and expansion of our retail and validation network were the primary drivers of this growth 
we anticipate that growth in will be driven in part by sustained demand for rmb tickets  as well as continued expansion of the retailer network and further optimization of retailer inventories 
we believe the retailer base of approximately  outlets at the end of an increase of approximately compared to the end of has significant room for growth 
we also believe retailer ticket inventory can be more effectively managed so that retailers do not run out of the most desirable and highest priced games  as occurred periodically in finally  during  we observed that retail sales declined in certain provinces after they had met their sales targets set by the csl well in advance of the end of the year  notwithstanding continued product demand 
in  we understand that sales targets were adjusted to be more in line with product demand on a province by province basis 
strategically  we intend to capitalize on trends that we see in the gaming industry 
we believe many of the growth opportunities in the gaming industry will be in wide area gaming venues such as pubs  bars  restaurants  truck stops  betting shops and other easily accessible land based venues  as well as via the internet and other new media 
we anticipate that the gaming industry will be increasingly characterized by demanding players who want the ability to play innovative games anytime and anywhere with one common electronic wallet  or account  to facilitate payment 
as such  we believe the industry will be increasingly characterized by convergence  or the interlinking of land based and virtual eg  internet gaming technologies  networks and content 
we also expect that regulators will play an increasingly important role in this convergence often as sponsors and not just regulators and that we will be well positioned to take advantage of this trend in light of our deep and longstanding relationships with government sponsored gaming entities 
we believe that sciplay  our recently announced internet focused joint ventures with playtech  which marry our gaming experience and government relationships with playtech s content and technological expertise  is the type of strategic initiative that has the potential to capitalize on these trends 
capitalizing on these changes in the industry will also depend in part on the opening of new business opportunities 
although the extent and timing is uncertain  we believe new business opportunities will grow as jurisdictions consider gaming tax revenues as a way to address significant budget shortfalls and fund public programs 
some us states are exploring allowing internet wagering within state lines providing potential opportunities for our sciplay joint venture 
vlt opportunities are opening up in other us states  canada and elsewhere through legislative actions or the passage of voter referendums 
lotteries are increasingly experimenting with selling tickets online  and we increasingly provide services to lotteries in support of other internet based lottery initiatives such as second chance drawings 
on january   we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our racing and venue management businesses to sportech for aggregate consideration of million 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including the closing of sportech s financing arrangements  receipt of certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions

the impairment charges are included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
as described below  the determination of when to recognize revenue for certain revenue transactions requires judgment 
revenue from licensed branded property coupled with a service component whereby we purchase and distribute merchandise prizes on behalf of the lottery authorities to identified winners is recognized on a proportional performance method as this method best reflects the pattern in which the obligations to customer are fulfilled 
a performance measure is used based on total estimated cost allocated to a specific contract 
by accumulating costs for services as they are incurred  and dividing such costs by the total contract costs which is estimated based on a budget prior to contract inception  a percentage is determined 
the percentage determined is applied to the total fixed price of the contract and that proportionate amount of revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue from the sale of lottery and pari mutuel systems that require the production and delivery of terminals and customized software is recognized using cost to cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products 
estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
revenues under percentage of completion contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from our current estimates 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow  using a discount rate equal to our weighted average cost of capital  or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
the estimate of a reporting unit s fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit s future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our goodwill and trademark may change in the future which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
income taxes and deferred income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
we establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is unlikely 
we have established a valuation allowance for foreign tax credits and certain tax loss carryforwards  as we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of these items will not be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance  against our deferred tax assets  our income tax expense will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
we account for income tax contingencies with the recognition of a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and any related accrued interest 
we recognize interest accrued for unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and recognize penalties in income tax expense

we also entered into certain other debt financing transactions during in order to defer certain earn out payments  extend the average maturity of our debt and create additional borrowing capacity 
on may   we entered into an agreement with the principal selling shareholder and key management of global draw related to the earn out and contingent bonuses that were payable to them in connection with the company s acquisition 
based on the performance of the business  the total amount payable was determined to be approximately million of which approximately million was paid in may approximately million of the total amount payable was deferred under the terms of the global draw promissory notes 
the earn out balance of approximately million was paid in september on may   sgi issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the initial notes at an issue price of of the principal amount 
the initial notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of may  the notes indenture among sgi  as issuer  the company  as a guarantor  the company s subsidiary guarantors party thereto and the bank of nova scotia trust company of new york  as trustee 
on november   sgi issued an additional million in aggregate principal amount of its senior subordinated notes due the additional notes and  together with the initial notes  the notes under the notes indenture at an issue price of of the principal amount thereof 
on october   sgi entered into a commitment letter with jp morgan securities inc and jpmorgan  pursuant to which jpmorgan has committed  subject to certain conditions  to provide up to million of senior secured term loans under one or more incremental term loan facilities pursuant to the credit agreement 
any proceeds from borrowings under these incremental term loan facilities would be available to be applied for general corporate purposes  which may include the payment of a portion of potential upfront payment or other obligations in connection with an award of a new italian instant ticket lottery concession 
sgi is not obligated to utilize this commitment or to borrow any amounts thereunder 
this commitment expires on june  during  we retired approximately in aggregate principal amount of our convertible debentures for approximately in cash as a result of repurchases under our previously announced repurchase program and pursuant to a tender offer completed in the fourth quarter 
approximately million of the convertible debentures remain outstanding as of december  also during  we repurchased approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due the notes for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
we may  from time to time  seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt in open market purchases  in privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise 
any such retirement or purchase of debt may be funded by cash flows from operations  borrowings or other sources and will depend upon prevailing market conditions  liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors  and the amounts involved may be material 
as of december   our total debt was comprised principally of million outstanding under our term loan facility under the credit agreement  million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  million in aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes due the notes  million in aggregate principal amount of the notes  million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible debentures  million in aggregate principal amount of the global draw promissory notes and loans denominated in chinese renminbi yuan rmb totaling rmb million the china loans 
in january  we repaid the china loans with the proceeds of two new loans totaling rmb million of which rmb million matures in december and rmb million matures in january the credit agreement and the indentures governing the notes  the notes and the notes contain covenants customary for financings of these types  including negative covenants that  among other things  limit the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make distributions or certain other restricted payments  purchase or redeem capital stock  make investments or extend credit  engage in certain transactions with affiliates  engage in sale leaseback transactions  consummate certain asset sales  effect a consolidation or merger  sell  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all assets  or create certain liens and other encumbrances on assets 
as of december   we had approximately million available for additional borrowing or letter of credit issuance under our million senior secured revolving credit facility under the credit agreement the revolver 
there were no borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under our revolver as of december  our pari mutuel wagering  online lottery  instant ticket validation and wide area gaming systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
our primary expenditures associated with these services are personnel and related costs  which are expensed as incurred and are included in operating expenses services in the consolidated statements of income 
historically  the revenues we derive from our service contracts have exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations thereunder 
we expect that we will continue to realize positive cash flow and operating income as we extend or renew existing service contracts 
we also expect that we will enter into new contracts that are accretive to our cash flow 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are continually deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies and cost saving initiatives will continue to positively impact our future cash flows and operating results 
in the next year  we expect to purchase approximately  ticket checking machines for our contract with the csl for a total cost of approximately million 
we are not party to any other material short term or long term obligations or commitments pursuant to these service contracts 
periodically  we bid on new pari mutuel  instant ticket validation and wide area gaming and online lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant up front capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically we have funded these up front costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to procure new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to borrow at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial up front costs 
once operational  long term service contracts have been accretive to our operating cash flow 
the actual level of capital expenditures will ultimately largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
furthermore  our pari mutuel wagering network consists of approximately  wagering terminals 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations  other than in the ordinary course of business 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuates principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities and changes in our working capital position 
the increase in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million  including a million cash dividend from cln  plus long term borrowings of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations and million provided by changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from decreases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses  deposits and other current assets offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to new lottery contracts such as connecticut and pennsylvania during cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the borrowings and the repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement and the notes 
in october  the members of cln tendered for a new nine year concession to operate the gratta e vinci instant ticket lottery upon the termination of cln s existing concession 
our bidding group was the only group to submit a bid 
in november  an italian administrative court voided the tender process in a ruling that has been appealed by the italian government 
a hearing on the appeal is expected on march  in the event that the appellate court sustains the lower court ruling  there will likely be a new tender process during which time and for a transitional period thereafter we expect that the existing concession would continue 
in the event that the appellate court reinstates the tender process  we expect the monopoli di stato to promptly award the new concession to our bidding group 
in such an event  we expect that we would be required to make our pro rata share of the upfront payments that would be required of our bidding group  which would be million payable shortly after the award is made and million payable on or about november  under the terms of the tender  assuming our ownership interest in the joint venture entity that holds the new concession remains at 
we incurred additional debt in in part to provide us with sufficient liquidity to make these upfront payments 
under the terms of the convertible debentures  the holders of the convertible debentures may require us to repurchase some or all of their debentures for cash on june  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the debentures being repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as of december   there was approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible debentures outstanding 
we expect to have enough available liquidity to retire all of the outstanding convertible debentures on june  if need be 
a substantial portion of our long term indebtedness may accelerate and become due in early unless the global draw promissory notes are no longer outstanding on february  or our available liquidity exceeds the aggregate principal amount of such notes then outstanding plus million 
the credit agreement contains a similar liquidity condition required to be satisfied on september  related to the notes 
see note long term and other debt included in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these liquidity conditions 
we expect that we will be able to satisfy these conditions and thereby prevent the acceleration of such indebtedness 
however  there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources  or will be able to arrange financing  to satisfy such conditions or to repay any accelerated indebtedness under our credit agreement or to repay the global draw promissory notes in or the notes in on march   we had sufficient unrestricted cash and availability under our revolving credit facility to satisfy the liquidity condition in the credit agreement related to the convertible debentures and thereby prevent the acceleration of borrowings under the credit agreement 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the foreseeable future  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
while we are not aware of any particular trends  our contracts periodically renew and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million compared to million at december  the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuates principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities and changes in our working capital position 
the increase in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million  including a million cash dividend from cln  plus long term borrowings of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations offset by million used in changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from increases in accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses  deposits and other current assets and accounts payable 
capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to the new lottery contracts in connecticut and pennsylvania  coupled with gaming terminals related to global draw and games media 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the borrowings and the repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement and the notes 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced any difficulty obtaining such bonds  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
while we are not aware of any reason to do so  if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and future minimum operating lease obligations  as set forth in the table below cash payments due by period in thousands total within year within years within years after years long term debt  notes long term debt  convertible debentures long term debt  notes long term debt  notes long term debt  term loan under credit agreement global draw promissory notes china loans other long term debt interest expense contractual capital requirements serp payout operating leases other long term liabilities total contractual obligations refer to note long term and other debt included in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding long term and other debt 
the convertible debentures are due in however  the convertible debentures could require cash payment before that date if holders of these convertible debentures exercise their right to require us to repurchase their convertible debentures or elect to convert the convertible debentures  subject to certain conditions  if we call the convertible debentures for redemption  or upon certain corporate transactions 
based on rates in effect at december  see note pension and other post retirement plans included in the notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the serp 
we have excluded approximately million of long term pension plan and other post retirement liabilities  deferred compensation liabilities of approximately million and the liability for uncertain tax positions of million at december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
recently issued accounting guidance in september  the financial accounting standards boards fasb amended the accounting standards codification asc as summarized in accounting standards update asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to remove from the scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions  tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated  to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence of selling price  and to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the accounting changes summarized in asu and asu are both effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
we are currently assessing the impact of these amendments to the asc on our accounting and reporting systems and processes  however  at this time we are unable to quantify the impact on our financial statements of our adoption or determine the timing and method of our adoption 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities and the definition of a variable interest entity vie and requires enhanced disclosures to provide more information about an enterprise s involvement in a vie 
in addition  it requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest gives it a controlling interest in a vie 
the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of the vie as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of the vie and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie 
this statement will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we are assessing the potential impact of adoption of this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
see item a risk factors for a more complete description of these risks and uncertainties 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances  and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production  prepaid phone card production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs  except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
while we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
all of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the below table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  capital resources and working capital for additional information about our financial instruments 
effective october   sgi entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement the hedge with jpmorgan 
under the hedge  sgi pays interest on a million notional amount of debt at a fixed rate of and receives interest on a million notional amount of debt at the prevailing three month libor rate 
the objective of the hedge is to eliminate the variability of cash flows attributable to the libor component of interest expense paid on million of our variable rate debt 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate december  dollars in thousands twelve months ended december thereafter total fmv debt at fixed interest rates weighted average interest rates debt at variable interest rates weighted average interest rates we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in australia  austria  chile  germany  ireland  mexico  the netherlands  spain  sweden and the united kingdom 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
although scientific games provides technology based products  systems and services to gaming industries worldwide  a substantial amount of our transactions and their resulting financial impact are transacted in us dollars 
the principal foreign currencies to which we have the most exposure are the euro and the pound  representing approximately and of our non u 
s dollar revenues in historically  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations have been more significant with respect to revenues than expenses  as a significant portion of our expenses  such as paper and ink  are contracted for in us dollars 
at december   a hypothetical strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and the pound would result in a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts and iii netting asset and liability exposures denominated in similar foreign currencies  to the extent possible 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit ratings 
the investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our investment income and interest expense from bank loans
