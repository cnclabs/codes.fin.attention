item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis presented in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item executive summary we believe we have successfully developed an overall risk management structure that focuses on risk at all levels of our organization 
through our operational risk strategy  we continue to focus on delivering the highest quality customer experience and continuous improvement initiatives  which we believe will both mitigate future business volatility and further strengthen our reputation 
through our insurance risk strategy  we have maintained our emphasis on pricing our business for profitable growth  and we have improved our risk profile through the development of a more balanced business mix across our product lines and the markets we serve 
through our investment risk strategy  we have managed our claim reserve discount rates relative to investment portfolio yield rates  avoided certain asset class problems  and continued to operate within a conservative investment risk appetite 
through the implementation of our capital management risk strategy  we have strengthened our balance sheet and maintained financial flexibility which we believe will support our operations over various economic cycles 
collectively  these efforts will help us manage operational  insurance  investment  and capital risk across our enterprise 
throughout  we continued our focus on a number of key areas 
our objectives for were consistent execution of our operating plans 
we continued our emphasis on disciplined  profitable growth 
maintain a strong investment portfolio 
we maintained disciplined credit analysis in our selection of investment assets and continued to be conservative within our investment risk tolerances 
build and effectively use capital 
we continued to build capital and manage it effectively within our capital management strategy objectives 
professional development of our employees 
we continued our focus on employee training and development as well as talent management 
operating performance our unum us segment reported an increase in segment operating income of percent in compared to last year  with the risk experience across our product lines remaining generally stable despite the difficult environment 
the benefit ratio for unum us was percent for compared to percent in the prior year  with group disability reporting a benefit ratio of percent in compared to percent in this was consistent with our goal of continual profit margin improvement for our unum us group disability line of business 
unum us premium income decreased percent in compared to market dynamics  including the ongoing high levels of unemployment and the competitive environment  continued to pressure our sales and premium income growth 
in particular  premium growth from existing customers was unfavorably impacted by lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy 
unum us sales increased percent in compared to last year 
our group core market segment  which we define for unum us as employee groups with fewer than  lives  reported a sales increase of percent in relative to the prior year 
the number of new accounts in our core market segment increased percent relative to sales in the group large case market segment increased percent compared to our supplemental and voluntary sales  which were negatively impacted by the current economic conditions  decreased percent in relative to the prior year 
new products and initiatives in included significant technology investments in our underwriting and claim management systems  expansion of our simply unum platform and the next generation of products  an increase in our enrollment teams to build enrollment capacity  and investments in training  development  and expansion of our sales force 
our unum uk segment reported a decrease in segment operating income of percent for  as measured in unum uk s local currency  relative to last year 
the decrease was driven primarily by an percent decline in premium income due to a smaller in force block of group disability business resulting from lower sales and persistency during and  primarily as a result of the competitive uk market 
similar to unum us  
table of contents premium income for unum uk was also negatively impacted during by lower premium growth from existing customers 
the benefit ratio for unum uk was percent in compared to percent in the prior year  with declining disability claim incidence and stable claim recoveries for group disability 
overall sales in unum uk increased percent in compared to the prior year  aided by the exit of another large insurance provider from the uk group risk market 
persistency generally improved over the levels of new initiatives in included the relaunch of our group life product and the development of new products intended to further expand the group market in the uk our colonial life segment reported an increase in segment operating income of percent in compared to last year 
premium income increased percent in despite the difficult environment 
risk results were generally in line with our expectations  with a benefit ratio of percent in compared to percent in colonial life s sales in increased percent relative to last year  with a percent growth in new account sales and a percent decline in existing account sales 
the largest sales growth by market segment was in the public sector  with growth of percent 
the number of new accounts and new contracts both increased relative to the prior year  while the average new case size declined 
new initiatives for included continued implementation of a new enrollment system and platform and investments in growing and expanding the sales force with particular focus on recruiting  training  and sales incentives 
our investment strategy continues to serve as an important component of our overall business performance 
we are focused on both the quality of our investment portfolio and on investing new money in investments appropriate for our liabilities 
the weighted average credit rating of our portfolio was a as of the end of the net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was billion at the end of  compared to a loss of billion at year end our net investment income in was percent below the level of the prior year  due primarily to the weaker pound to dollar exchange rate  fewer bond call premiums and consent fees  lower income on bonds in unum uk for which interest income is linked to an inflation index  and lower interest rates on floating rate assets 
the impact on operating results from the lower net investment income on floating rate assets and the inflation index linked investments was partially offset by lower debt interest expense and benefits and reserves 
although our results include net realized investment losses on fixed maturity securities that we either sold or considered other than temporarily impaired  we believe our investment portfolio is well positioned 
we have low levels of below investment grade securities  no exposure to subprime mortgages  alt a loans  or collateralized debt obligations in our asset backed or mortgage backed securities portfolios  and minimal exposure to collateralized debt obligations within our public bond portfolio 
we believe our capital and financial position are very strong 
at the end of  the risk based capital ratio for our traditional us insurance subsidiaries  calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula  was approximately percent  compared to percent at the end of our leverage ratio  when calculated excluding the non recourse debt and associated capital of tailwind holdings  llc tailwind holdings and northwind holdings  llc northwind holdings  was percent at december  compared to percent at december  our leverage ratio  when calculated using consolidated debt to total consolidated capital  was percent at december  compared to percent at december  the cash and marketable securities at our holding companies equaled approximately million at the end of compared to million at the end of further discussion is included in segment results  investments  and liquidity and capital resources contained in this item outlook for during  we intend to continue our focus on a number of key areas 
consistently execute our operating plans with an emphasis on disciplined  profitable growth 
further enhance financial flexibility through solid operating and investment performance  as well as a disciplined approach to capital management 
continue to invest in our business  including our products and services  as well as in the professional development of our employees 
remain positioned to capitalize on long term growth opportunities in the marketplace 

table of contents looking ahead  we have confidence in our overall financial position as well as our position in the markets in which we operate 
while this economic environment continues to present a number of challenges  not the least of which is an uncertain employment outlook  we believe substantial opportunities exist for our business  and we will continue to take steps to ensure that we are well positioned to capitalize on them 
specifically  we will continue our disciplined approach to growth and risk management during we intend to closely monitor emerging risks and adjust our strategies as appropriate 
we expect our capital to continue to build as we take a conservative approach to capital deployment and seek to retain significant financial flexibility 
from a growth standpoint  we expect that may be characterized by earnings growth somewhat below our longer term expectations for our business areas due to continuing pressures on new revenue 
although we expect sales and premium growth during in a number of our product lines as we implement our market strategies  consolidated sales and premium income may continue to be impacted by the recession 
this may be reflected by slower growth in sales and premiums resulting from the high unemployment rates  lower salary growth  and lower growth in the number of employees covered under existing customer policies 
we have thus far seen little recessionary impact on our group disability incidence levels 
we will continue to focus on disciplined underwriting  pricing  claims management  investment strategies  and expense management 
regulatory issues during  we completed the claim reassessment process required by the and regulatory settlement agreements 
the lead regulators conducted a final examination and presented their findings to unum group s board of directors and management on april  the report of the multistate market conduct examination for the maine bureau of insurance  massachusetts division of insurance  new york state insurance department  tennessee department of commerce and insurance  and other participating jurisdictions as well as the report of the california department of insurance market conduct examination both provided that we satisfactorily complied with each of the agreements mandates and that no fines will be assessed 
prior to completion of the claim reassessment process  in the second quarter of we increased our provision for the estimated cost of the claim reassessment process million before tax and million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim 
the revised second quarter of estimate was based on the cost of approximately percent of the potential inventory of claim reassessment information forms returned to us  with our claim reassessment on approximately percent of the forms completed at that time 
at the time of our second quarter of revision  we had not yet finalized our claim reassessment on the remaining forms but had performed a financial review and included that information in our analysis of emerging experience 
additional information regarding the second quarter revision to our estimate is as follows we increased our previous estimate for benefit costs for claims reopened for our unum us group long term disability product line million 
the revision related to the increase during the second quarter of in the overturn rate and the average cost  as well as a slightly higher number of claims 
we decreased our previous estimate for benefit costs for claims reopened for our individual disability closed block segment million 
although the experience relative to our assumptions for the overturn rate was slightly higher  experience indicated that the total number of claims for this segment would be fewer than our previous assumptions 
we decreased our previous estimate for the additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses million due to our projections for an earlier completion of the reassessment process 
we released million for unum us group long term disability and million for our individual disability closed block segment 
these second quarter of adjustments to our claim reassessment costs decreased before tax operating earnings for our unum us group disability line of business million and increased before tax operating earnings for our individual disability closed block segment million 

table of contents acquisitions and dispositions during the first quarter of  we established a new company  unum ireland limited  which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of unum group 
the purpose of unum ireland limited is to expand our information technology resource options to ensure that our resource capacity keeps pace with the growing demand for information technology support 
this subsidiary is located in carlow  ireland 
during the first quarter of  we completed the sale of our wholly owned subsidiary  genex services  inc genex  a leading workers compensation and medical cost containment services provider 
our growth strategy is focused on the development of our primary markets  and genex s specialty role in case management and medical cost containment related to the workers compensation market was no longer consistent with our overall strategic direction 
we recognized an after tax gain on the transaction of approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for additional information 
accounting updates for information on accounting updates and the impact  if any  on our financial position or results of operations  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates we deem to be most critical to our results of operations and balance sheets are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits  deferred acquisition costs  valuation of investments  pension and postretirement benefit plans  income taxes  and contingent liabilities 
estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known  which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
for additional information  refer to our significant accounting policies in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item reserves for policy and contract benefits our largest liabilities are reserves for claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders 
the two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
these reserves equaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively  or approximately percent of our total liabilities at year end reserves ceded to reinsurers were billion at december  and and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets 
policy reserves policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums  allowing a margin for expenses and profit 
these reserves relate primarily to our traditional non interest sensitive products  including our individual disability  individual and group long term care  and voluntary benefits products in our unum us segment  individual disability products in our unum uk segment  disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our colonial life segment  and  the individual disability closed block segment products 
the reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate ie  loss recognition occurs 
persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations 
claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations 

table of contents discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns 
in establishing policy reserves  we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience  which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation 
we do not  however  establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions 
we perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually  or more frequently if appropriate  using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test  without a provision for adverse deviation 
we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests 
if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance  the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency 
thereafter  the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing  referred to as the gross premium valuation method  wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation loss recognition date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive 
because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency  mortality and morbidity  and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time  policy reserve assumptions are not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance 
therefore  we maintain policy reserves for a policy for as long as the policy remains in force  even after a separate claim reserve is established 
incidence rates in industry standard valuation tables for policy reserves have traditionally included all lives  active and disabled 
in addition  the waiver of premium provision provides funding for the policy reserve while a policyholder is disabled 
as a result  the funding mechanisms and the cost of claims are aligned and require a policy reserve to be held while on claim 
in addition  most policies allow for multiple occurrences of claims  and a policy reserve is consequently still maintained at the time of claim to fund any potential future claims 
the policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders reach the terminal age for coverage  die  or voluntarily lapse the policy 
policy reserves for unum us  unum uk  and colonial life products  which at december  represented approximately percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our total gross policy reserves  are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by gaap 
in applying this method  we use  as applicable by product type  morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions  claim resolution rate assumptions  and policy persistency assumptions  among others  to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income 
we then apply an interest  or discount  rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive  with a provision for profit allowed 
policy reserves for our individual disability closed block segment  which at december   represented approximately percent of our total gross policy reserves  are determined using the gross premium valuation method based on assumptions established as of january   the date of loss recognition 
key assumptions are policy persistency  claim incidence  claim resolution rates  commission rates  and maintenance expense rates 
we then apply an interest  or discount  rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive 
there is no provision for profit 
the interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for this segment 
under the gross premium valuation method  we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions 
gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient 
we perform loss recognition tests on the policy reserves for this block of business quarterly 
the corporate and other segment includes certain products no longer actively marketed  the majority of which have been reinsured 
policy reserves for this segment represent billion on a gross basis  or approximately percent  of our total policy reserves 
we have ceded billion of the related policy reserves to reinsurers 
the ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable 
we continue to service a block of group pension products  which we have not ceded  and the policy reserves for these products are 
table of contents based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates 
expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities 
claim reserves claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr to us and  as prescribed by gaap  equals our long term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses 
a claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim  such as the benefits available under the applicable policy  the covered benefit period  and the age and occupation of the claimant  as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration and discount rate 
reserves for ibnr claims  similar to incurred claim reserves  include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims  are also based on historical incidence rate assumptions  including claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 
our incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions 
claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change 
each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate 
if we believe  based on our actual experience and our view of future events  that our long term assumptions need to be modified  we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period income 
multiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities  with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages 
available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method  the paid development method  the incurred loss development method  the count and severity method  and the expected claim cost method 
no singular method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines 
the estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves at that time 
claim reserves supporting our unum us group and individual disability and group and individual long term care lines of business and our individual disability closed block segment represent approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our total claim reserves at december  we use a tabular reserve methodology for group and individual long term disability and group and individual long term care claims that have been reported 
under the tabular reserve methodology  reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants  such as age  length of time disabled  and medical diagnosis 
we believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim 
ibnr claim reserves for our long term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs 
for group short term disability products  an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted  as well as ibnr claims  is determined in aggregate rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for our long term products  using historical patterns of claim incidence as well as historical patterns of aggregate claim resolution rates 
the average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long term liabilities and results in less estimation variability 
claim reserves supporting the unum us group life and accidental death and dismemberment products represent approximately percent of our total claim reserves at december  claim reserves for these products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid  ibnr death claims  and a liability for waiver of premium benefits 
the death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid  the ibnr reserve is calculated using the count and severity method  and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology 
claim reserves supporting our unum uk segment represent approximately percent of our total claim reserves at december   and are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for unum us disability 
table of contents and group life reserves 
the assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard united kingdom industry experience  adjusted for unum uk s own experience 
the majority of the colonial life segment lines of business have short term benefits  which have less estimation variability than our long term products because of the shorter claim payout period 
our claim reserves for colonial life s lines of business  which approximate percent of our total claim reserves at december   are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience 
the incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date 
where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate  we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure 
the key assumptions for claim reserves for the colonial life lines of business are the timing  rate  and amount of estimated future claim payments  and the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims 
the following table displays policy reserves  incurred claim reserves  and ibnr claim reserves by major product line  with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable 
incurred claim reserves represent reserves determined for each incurred claim and also include estimated amounts for litigation expenses and other expenses associated with the payment of the claims as well as provisions for claims which we estimate will be reopened for our long term care products 
ibnr claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products 
the ibnr and reopen claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis

unrealized adj 
unrealized adjustment to reserves for unrealized loss on securities consolidated key assumptions the calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions  but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are the discount rate  the claim resolution rate  and the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves 
of these assumptions  our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time 
the discount rate  which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves  is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present 
table of contents value 
a higher discount rate produces a lower reserve 
if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns  our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments 
in this case  the reserves may eventually be insufficient 
we set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves  considering current and expected future market conditions 
if the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio  it is likely that the discount rate assumption on claims will be established to reflect the effect of the new investment yield 
the claim resolution rate  used for both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves  is the probability that a disability claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured 
it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim 
estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time 
claim resolution assumptions involve many factors  including the cause of disability  the policyholder s age  the type of contractual benefits provided  and the time since initially becoming disabled 
we use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions 
these assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability 
our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years  with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years 
we also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience 
the incidence rate  used for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves  is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us 
the incidence rate is affected by many factors  including the age of the insured  the insured s occupation or industry  the benefit plan design  and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment 
we establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations 
establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors 
reserves  particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long term disabilities  are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion 
the impact of internal and external events  such as changes in claims management procedures  economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence  the emergence of new diseases  new trends and developments in medical treatments  and legal trends and legislative changes  among other factors  will influence claim incidence and resolution rates 
reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line 
additionally  in any period and over time  our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long term assumptions  either singularly or collectively  and these variances may offset each other 
we test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a long term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time 
therefore it is not possible to bifurcate the assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption  but rather in the aggregate by product line 
we have presented in the following section an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions  in aggregate  for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for  either favorable or unfavorable 
trends in key assumptions because our actual experience regarding persistency and claim incidence has varied very little from our policy reserve and ibnr claim reserve assumptions  we have had minimal adjustments to our persistency assumptions and claim incidence assumptions during the years through generally  we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent that these trends do change  we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 
however  we have historically experienced an increase in our group long term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period  particularly in our unum us operations 
during the second half of  claim incidence rates for unum us group long term disability were slightly elevated 
given the current economic conditions  it is possible that our claim incidence rates for this type of product may increase 

table of contents throughout the period to  actual new money interest rates varied with the changing market conditions  and the assumptions we used to discount our reserves generally trended downward slightly for all segments and product lines 
reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims have been adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns 
changes in our discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long duration investment portfolio needed to support the reserves for the majority of our lines of business 
both the mortality rate experience and the retirement rate experience for our block of group pension products have remained stable and consistent with expectations 
claim resolution rates have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions 
these rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately 
claim resolution rates in our unum us segment group and individual long term disability product lines and our individual disability closed block segment have over the last several years exhibited some variability 
relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business  actual quarterly rates during the period through have varied by and percent in our unum us group long term disability line of business  between and percent in our unum us individual disability recently issued line of business  and between and percent in our individual disability closed block segment 
claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time 
during and continuing throughout and  we gained more stability in our claims management performance relative to  and our claim resolution rates were more consistent with our long term assumptions 
our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period  both favorably and unfavorably 
we monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate 
in our estimation  scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions  when modeled together in aggregate  could produce a potential result  either positive or negative  in our unum us group disability line of business that would change our reserve balance by percent 
using our actual claim reserve balance at december   this variation would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of million to our claim reserves 
using the same sensitivity analysis approach for our individual disability closed block segment  the claim reserve balance could potentially vary by percent of our reported balance  which at december   would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of million to our claim reserves 
the major contributor to the variance for both the group long term disability line of business and the individual disability closed block segment is the claim resolution rate 
we believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions  in the aggregate  could result in a material impact on our reserve levels  but we record our reserves based on our long term best estimate 
because these product lines have long term claim payout periods  there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs  either positive or negative 
deferred acquisition costs dac we defer certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortize expense these costs over the life of the related policies 
deferred costs include certain commissions  other agency compensation  selection and policy issue expenses  and field expenses 
acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business  such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy  are excluded from deferral 
approximately percent of our dac relates to traditional non interest sensitive products  and we amortize dac in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies 
key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of dac are future persistency and future premium income 
we use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining the expected persistency and premium income 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to higher anticipated policy persistency in the early years  which results 
table of contents in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
during  our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization did not change materially from those used in the prior year 
generally  we do not expect our persistency or interest rates to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent that these trends do change  we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 
presented below are our current assumptions regarding the length of our amortization periods  the approximate dac balance that remains at the end of years   and as a percentage of the cost initially deferred  and our dac balances as of december  and amortization period balance remaining as a of initial deferral dac balances at december year year year in millions of dollars unum us group disability group life and accidental death dismemberment to supplemental and voluntary individual disability recently issued long term care voluntary benefits to unum uk group disability group life individual disability colonial life totals amortization of dac on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience  and as a result  the unamortized balance of dac reflects actual persistency 
we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
because our actual experience regarding persistency and premium income has varied very little from our assumptions during the last three years  we have had minimal adjustments to our projected amortization of dac during those years 
we measure the recoverability of dac annually by performing gross premium valuations 
our testing indicates that our dac is recoverable 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued a proposed accounting standards update which is intended to address diversity in practice regarding the interpretation of which costs relating to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts qualify as deferred acquisition costs 
if the proposed guidance is adopted as currently written  this update will result in a decrease in the level of costs we defer  effective january  we have not yet quantified the impact on our financial position or results of operations 
valuation of investments all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
our derivative financial instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value 
we hold an immaterial amount of equity securities  which are also reported at fair value 

table of contents definition of fair value fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and  therefore  represents an exit price  not an entry price 
the exit price objective applies regardless of a reporting entity s intent and or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
an active market for a financial instrument is a market in which transactions for an asset or a similar asset occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
a quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and should be used to measure fair value whenever available 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation techniques that require more judgment 
pricing observability is generally impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established  the characteristics specific to the transaction  and overall market conditions 
valuation techniques valuation techniques used for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value are generally categorized into three types the market approach uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparables or matrix pricing 
market multiples might lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable 
the selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment  considering both quantitative and qualitative factors specific to the measurement 
matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but comparing the securities to benchmark or comparable securities 
the income approach converts future amounts  such as cash flows or earnings  to a single present amount  or a discounted amount 
income approach techniques rely on current market expectations of future amounts 
examples of income approach valuation techniques include present value techniques  option pricing models that incorporate present value techniques  and the multi period excess earnings method 
the cost approach is based upon the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset  or the current replacement cost 
that is  from the perspective of a market participant seller  the price that would be received for the asset is determined based on the cost to a market participant buyer to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility 
we use valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available that can be obtained without undue cost and effort 
in some cases  a single valuation technique will be appropriate for example  when valuing an asset or liability using quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities 
in other cases  multiple valuation techniques will be appropriate 
if we use multiple valuation techniques to measure fair value  we evaluate and weigh the results  as appropriate  considering the reasonableness of the range indicated by those results 
a fair value measurement is the point within that range that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances 
the selection of the valuation method s to apply considers the definition of an exit price and depends on the nature of the asset or liability being valued 
for assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value  we generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  and to a lesser extent  the income approach 
we believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach  considering the type of investments we hold 
our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and 
table of contents available inputs 
when markets are less active  brokers may rely more on models with inputs based on the information available only to the broker 
in weighing a broker quote as an input to fair value  we place less reliance on quotes that do not reflect the result of market transactions 
we also consider the nature of the quote  particularly whether the quote is a binding offer 
if prices in an inactive market do not reflect current prices for the same or similar assets  adjustments may be necessary to arrive at fair value 
when relevant market data is unavailable  which may be the case during periods of market uncertainty  the income approach can  in suitable circumstances  provide a more appropriate fair value 
during  we have applied valuation techniques on a consistent basis to similar assets and liabilities and consistent with those techniques used at year end because of market conditions existing during and  the mix and availability of observable inputs for valuation techniques have been volatile  and the risk inherent in the inputs is elevated relative to prior years 
inputs to valuation techniques inputs refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities  including assumptions about risk  for example  the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value such as a pricing model and or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
inputs may be observable or unobservable 
observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources 
unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
inputs that may be used include the following broker market maker prices and price levels trade reporting and compliance engine trace pricing prices obtained from external pricing services benchmark yields treasury and interest rate swap curves transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades security cash flows and structures recent issuance supply sector and issuer level spreads security credit ratings maturity capital structure optionality corporate actions underlying collateral prepayment speeds loan performance delinquencies weighted average life seasoning public covenants comparative bond analysis derivative spreads relevant reports issued by analysts and rating agencies we review all prices obtained to ensure they are consistent with a variety of observable market inputs and to verify the validity of a security s price 
the overall valuation process for determining fair values may include adjustments to valuations obtained from our pricing sources when they do not represent a valid exit price 
these adjustments may be made when  in our judgment and considering our knowledge of the financial conditions and industry in which the issuer operates  certain features of the financial instrument require that an adjustment be made to the value originally obtained from our pricing sources 
these features may include the complexity of the financial instrument  the market in which the financial instrument is traded  counterparty credit risk  credit structure  concentration  or liquidity 
additionally  an adjustment to the price derived from a model typically reflects our judgment of the inputs that other participants in the market for the financial instrument being measured at fair value would consider in pricing that same financial instrument 

table of contents the parameters and inputs used to validate a price on a security may be adjusted for assumptions about risk and current market conditions on a quarter to quarter basis  as certain features may be more significant drivers of valuation at the time of pricing 
changes to inputs in valuations are not changes to valuation methodologies  rather  the inputs are modified to reflect direct or indirect impacts on asset classes from changes in market conditions 
fair values for derivatives other than embedded derivatives in modified coinsurance arrangements are based on market quotes or pricing models and represent the net amount of cash we would have paid or received if the contracts had been settled or closed as of the last day of the period 
we analyze credit default swap spreads relative to the average credit spread embedded within the london interbank offered rate libor setting syndicate in determining the effect of credit risk on our derivatives fair values 
if counterparty credit risk for a derivative asset is determined to be material and is not adequately reflected in the libor based fair value obtained from our pricing sources  we adjust the valuations obtained from our pricing sources 
in regard to our own credit risk component  we adjust the valuation of derivative liabilities wherein the counterparty is exposed to our credit risk when the libor based valuation of our derivatives obtained from pricing sources does not effectively include an adequate credit component for our own credit risk 
fair values for our embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement are estimated using internal pricing models and represent the hypothetical value of the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities  interest rate risk  and third party credit risk embedded in the modified coinsurance arrangement 
certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity 
for these securities  we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
additionally  we may obtain prices from independent third party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities 
key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market 
as of december   the key assumptions we generally used to estimate the fair value of these types of securities included those listed below 
where appropriate  we have noted the assumption used for the prior period as well as the reason for the change 
risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 
this compares to interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities used at december  current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points were added to the risk free rate to reflect the lack of liquidity 
we used spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points at december  the changes were based on observable market spreads 
newly issued private placement securities have historically offered yield premiums of basis points over comparable newly issued public securities 
an additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments  consistent with december  additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
increasing the basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by one basis point  increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point  and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the december  fair value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio by approximately million 
we believe this range of variability is appropriate  and historically the inputs noted have generally not deviated outside the range provided 
we regularly test the validity of the fair values determined by our valuation techniques by comparing the prices of assets sold to the fair values reported for the assets in the immediately preceding reporting period 
historically  our realized gains or losses on dispositions of investments have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under 
table of contents the valuation methodologies described above  which  combined with the results of our testing  indicates to us that our pricing methodologies are appropriate 
at december   approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued using active trades from trace pricing  or broker market maker prices for which there was current market activity in that specific security comparable to receiving one binding quote 
the prices obtained were not adjusted  and the assets were classified as level  the highest category of the three level fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
the remaining percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on non binding quotes or other observable or unobservable inputs  as discussed below 
approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices from pricing services that generally use observable inputs such as prices for securities or comparable securities in active markets in their valuation techniques 
these assets were classified as level level assets or liabilities are those valued using inputs other than prices included in level that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on one or more non binding broker price levels  if validated by observable market data  or on trace prices for identical or similar assets absent current market activity 
when only one price is available  it is used if observable inputs and analysis confirm that it is appropriate 
these assets  for which we were able to validate the price using other observable market data  were classified as level approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were valued based on prices of comparable securities  matrix pricing  market models  and or internal models or were valued based on non binding quotes with no other observable market data 
these assets were classified as either level or level  with the categorization dependent on whether there was other observable market data 
level is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
financial assets and liabilities categorized as level are generally those that are valued using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value 
we consider transactions in inactive or disorderly markets to be less representative of fair value 
we use all available observable inputs when measuring fair value  but when significant other unobservable inputs and adjustments are necessary  we classify these assets or liabilities as level as of december   approximately percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as level  percent as level  and percent as level during  we transferred million of fixed maturity securities into level and million of fixed maturity securities out of level the transfers between levels resulted primarily from a change in observability of three inputs used to determine fair values of the securities transferred transactional data for new issuance and secondary trades  broker dealer quotes and pricing  primarily related to changes in the level of activity in the market and whether the market was considered orderly  and comparable bond metrics from which to perform an analysis 
for fair value measurements of financial instruments that were transferred either into or out of level  we reflect the transfers using the fair value at the beginning of the period 
we believe this allows for greater transparency as all changes in fair value that arise during the reporting period of the transfer are disclosed as a component of our level reconciliation as shown in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item other than temporary impairment analysis for investments in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  we evaluate the following factors whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security 

table of contents whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments 
the significance of the decline in value 
the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value 
current and future business prospects and trends of earnings 
the valuation of the security s underlying collateral 
relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles 
market conditions 
rating agency and governmental actions 
bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity 
adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments 
changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
any other key measures for the related security 
we evaluate available information  including the factors noted above  both positive and negative  in reaching our conclusions 
in particular  we also consider the strength of the issuer s balance sheet  its debt obligations and near term funding requirements  cash flow and liquidity  the profitability of its core businesses  the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity  its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment  and its access to capital markets 
although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis  our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security  whether we intend to sell the security  whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost  and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary 
the significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors  but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors  since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security 
while determining other than temporary impairments is a judgmental area  we utilize a formal  well defined  and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio  supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period 
the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other than temporary impairment 
if we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period  either in earnings or in both earnings and other comprehensive income  as applicable 
for those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss for which we have not recognized an other than temporary impairment  we believe we will recover the entire amortized cost  we do not intend to sell the security  and we do not believe it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost 
there have been no defaults in the repayment obligations of any securities for which we have not recorded an other than temporary impairment 
other than temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities which we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell before recovery in value are recognized in earnings and equal the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value 
for securities which we do not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell before recovery in value  other than temporary impairment losses recognized in earnings generally represent the difference between the amortized cost of the security and the present value of our best estimate of cash flows expected to be collected  discounted using the effective interest rate implicit in the security at the date of acquisition 
the determination of cash flows is inherently subjective  and methodologies may vary depending on the circumstances specific to the security 
the timing and amount of our cash flow estimates are developed using historical and forecast financial information from the issuer  including its current and projected liquidity position 
we also consider industry analyst reports and forecasts  sector credit ratings  future business prospects and earnings trends  issuer refinancing capabilities  actual and or potential asset sales by the issuer  and other data relevant to the collectibility of the contractual cash flows of the security 
we take into account the probability of default  expected recoveries  third party guarantees  quality of collateral  and where 
table of contents our debt security ranks in terms of subordination 
we may use the estimated fair value of collateral as a proxy for the present value of cash flows if we believe the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for recovery of our investment 
for fixed maturity securities for which we have recognized an other than temporary impairment loss through earnings  if through subsequent evaluation there is a significant increase in expected cash flows  the difference between the new amortized cost basis and the cash flows expected to be collected is accreted as net investment income 
we use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation 
mortgage loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio  considering the value of the underlying collateral 
mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  in which case the reduction is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income 
there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities the assessment of a borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change 
the economic outlook  either domestic or foreign  may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated  and as such  the investment may not recover in value 
new information may become available concerning the security  such as disclosure of accounting irregularities  fraud  or corporate governance issues 
significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry 
significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased 
adverse rating agency actions may occur 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans for our employees  including non qualified pension plans 
the us pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and pension expense 
our uk operation maintains a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees 
the uk defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on december  our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
we also use  as applicable  expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits  which reflects a health care cost trend rate 
the assumptions chosen for our pension and opeb plans are reviewed annually  and we use a december measurement date for each of our plans 
the discount rate assumptions and expected long term rate of return assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans 
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and opeb plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
discount rate assumptions the discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value 
we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our retirement related benefit plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of 
table of contents projected future benefits 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs 
the discount rate we used to determine our and net periodic benefit costs for our us pension plans was percent for both years 
the discount rate used for the net periodic benefit costs for and for our uk pension plan was percent and percent  respectively 
the discount rate used in the net periodic benefit cost for our opeb plan for and was percent and percent  respectively 
reducing the discount rate assumption by basis points would have resulted in an increase in our pension expense of approximately million  before tax  and an increase in our benefit obligation of approximately million as of december   resulting in an after tax decrease in stockholders equity of approximately million as of december  a basis point reduction in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual opeb costs 
increasing the discount rate assumption by basis points would have resulted in a decrease in our pension expense of approximately million  before tax  and a decrease in our benefit obligation of approximately million as of december   resulting in an after tax increase in stockholders equity of approximately million as of december  a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual opeb costs 
long term rate of return assumptions the long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid 
we use a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on pension plan assets 
the investment portfolio for our us pension plans contains a diversified blend of domestic and international large cap  mid cap  and small cap equity securities  us government and corporate fixed income securities  private equity funds of funds  and hedge funds of funds 
assets for our uk pension plan are invested in pooled funds  such as global equities  hedge funds  commodities  below investment grade fixed income securities  and currencies  as well as a fixed interest uk corporate bond fund and an index linked uk government bond fund 
assets for our opeb plan are invested primarily in life insurance contracts 
we believe our investment portfolios are well diversified by asset class and sector  with no potential risk concentrations in any one category 
our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance and evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists 
the methodology underlying the return assumption included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as long term rates of return  volatility of returns  and the correlation of returns between various asset classes 
the expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan s strategic asset allocation 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements  periodic asset liability studies  and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 
risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
the long term rate of return on assets used in the net periodic pension costs for our us qualified defined benefit pension plan for and was percent for both years 
the long term rate of return on asset assumption used for and for our uk pension plan was percent and percent  respectively  and for our opeb plan  percent for both years 
the actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period  adjusted for contributions and benefit payments 
changing the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets by basis points would have changed our pension plan expense by approximately million before tax  but our opeb plan expense would not change 
a lower rate of return on plan assets increases our expense 

table of contents benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets the market related value equals the fair value of assets  determined as of the measurement date 
the expected return on assets fully recognizes all asset gains and losses  including changes in fair value  through the measurement date 
during  the fair value of our plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan increased million  or approximately percent 
the fair value of plan assets for our uk pension plan increased million  or approximately percent  during although the effect of these increases had no impact on our net periodic pension costs  the favorable rate of return on plan assets in has a favorable impact on our net periodic pension costs for we expect that our pension costs will be lower than our pension costs in we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment 
our pension and opeb plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of million and an unrecognized prior service credit of million  which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense 
as of december   the unrecognized net loss for these two items combined was approximately million 
the decrease relative to is primarily due to the favorable rate of return on plan assets in the unrecognized gains or losses are amortized as a component of the net benefit cost 
our   and pension and opeb expense includes million  million  and million  respectively  of amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial loss and prior service credit 
the higher amortization in resulted primarily from the increase in the unrecognized net actuarial loss during due to the unfavorable rate of return on plan assets for our us pension plans 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans  which is million at december   will be amortized over the average future working life of pension plan participants  currently estimated at years for us participants and years for us participants 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million for our opeb plan will be amortized over the average future working life of opeb plan participants  currently estimated at years  to the extent the loss is outside of a corridor established in accordance with gaap 
the corridor for the pension and opeb plans is established based on the greater of percent of the plan assets or percent of the benefit obligation 
at december   none of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the opeb plan 
the fair value of plan assets in our us qualified defined benefit pension plan was million at december   compared to million at year end this increase in fair value of plan assets and the effect of the plan contribution during lowered our year end deficit funding level in the plan to million as of december   compared to a deficit of million as of december  during february  we made a voluntary contribution of million to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan  thereby further reducing the deficit funding level 
the fair value of plan assets in our opeb plan was million and million at december  and  respectively 
these assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our opeb plan 
our opeb plan represents a non vested  non guaranteed obligation  and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits  which are comprised of retiree life  medical  and dental benefits 
it is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our opeb plan 
we expect to continue to receive subsidies under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  based on current law  to partially offset these payments 
the expected subsidy included in our consolidated balance sheets is immaterial 
our expected return on plan assets and discount rate discussed above will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our us pension and opeb plans because we have met all minimum funding requirements set forth by erisa 
we had no regulatory contribution requirements for and  however  we elected to make voluntary contributions of million and million  respectively  to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan 
as noted above  we made a voluntary contribution of million to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan in february we do not anticipate making any additional contributions during 
table of contents during  the federal government enacted the pension protection act of which requires companies to fully fund defined benefit pension plans over a seven year period 
we have evaluated this requirement and have made estimates of amounts to be funded in the future 
based on this assessment  we do not believe that the funding requirements of the pension protection act will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
the fair value of plan assets for our uk pension plan was million at december   compared to million at december  the uk pension plan has a deficit of million at december   compared to million at december  we contribute to the plan in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires that we contribute to the plan at the rate of at least percent of employee salaries  sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation 
during and  we made required contributions of million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that we will make contributions during of approximately million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussion 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowance relates primarily to assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards and assets for our basis in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are not likely to be realized in the future based on our expectations using currently available evidence 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we have considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability 
gaap prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
if a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured  the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective 
we believe that tax positions have been reflected in our financial statements at appropriate amounts in conformity with gaap 
contingent liabilities on a quarterly basis  we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
an estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending  in part  on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period

except for a limited number of transactions  we do not actually convert pounds into dollars 
as a result  we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk consolidated premium income for both and includes premium growth  relative to the preceding years  for unum us supplemental and voluntary lines of business and colonial life 
unum us group disability and group life and accidental death and dismemberment lines of business experienced year over year declines in premium income during and relative to the prior years 
a portion of this decline was expected and is attributable to our continued pricing discipline for our unum us group business and our strategy of developing a more balanced business mix 
however  during  premium growth for unum us group business was also negatively impacted by lower premium growth from existing customers due to lower salary growth and lower growth in the number of employees covered under an existing policy

table of contents the in force block also unfavorably impacted unum uk premium growth during relative to premium income in the individual disability closed block segment continues to decline  as expected  in this closed block of business 
net investment income was lower in relative to the prior year due to several factors i the weaker pound in relative to unfavorably affected translated results for net investment income  ii we received lower interest income during on bonds in unum uk for which interest income is linked to a uk inflation index  the impact of which was largely offset by lower claim reserves due to lower claim payments which are also linked to inflation  iii during we earned lower interest rates on our floating rate invested assets  largely offset by lower interest expense on our floating rate debt  and iv we received fewer bond call premiums and consent fees during compared to somewhat mitigating the impact of these items is continued growth in the level of invested assets  an increase in the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities  and an increase in our portfolio yield due to the investment of new cash at higher rates than that of prior periods 
net investment income was marginally lower in relative to during  we received fewer bond call premiums  and the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities declined relative to the preceding year 
the weaker pound in relative to also unfavorably affected translated results for net investment income 
the impact of these items was mostly offset by continued growth in the level of invested assets and a slight increase in our portfolio yield due to the investment of new cash at higher rates 
we recognized in earnings a net realized investment gain of million in compared to losses of million in and million in during  we recognized other than temporary impairment losses of million related to fixed maturity securities  million of which was recognized in earnings and million in other comprehensive income

consolidated sales results in millions of dollars year ended december change change unum us fully insured products administrative services only aso products total unum us unum uk colonial life individual disability closed block consolidated sales results shown in the preceding chart generally represent the annualized premium or annualized fee income on new sales which we expect to receive and report as premium income or fee income during the next months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported  depending on the effective date of the new sale 
sales do not correspond to premium income or fee income reported as revenue in accordance with gaap 
this is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium or fee income over a month period  while premium income and fee income reported in our financial statements are reported on an as earned basis rather than an annualized basis and also include renewals and persistency of in force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales 
premiums for fully insured products are reported as premium income 
fees for aso products those where the risk and responsibility for funding claim payments remain with the customer and we only provide services are included in other income 
sales  persistency of the existing block of business  and the effectiveness of the renewal program are indicators of growth in our premium and fee income 
trends in new sales  as well as existing market share  also indicate our potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new product offerings 
sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions 
we intend to continue with our disciplined approach to pricing and also with our strategy of developing a more balanced business mix 
this strategy could result in a lower premium persistency or market share  particularly in the large case unum us group market  but historically the profitability of business that terminates has generally been lower than the profitability of retained business 
we do not anticipate any meaningful decline in the number of cases  or case persistency  for our unum us group market on an aggregate basis 
we have experienced lower sales growth during  particularly in the expansion of sales to existing accounts and with buyers of our supplemental and voluntary type products  which we believe is mostly attributable to the current economic environment 
we expect this unfavorable pattern may continue in the near term if current economic conditions persist

table of contents segment results our reporting segments are comprised of the following unum us  unum uk  colonial life  individual disability closed block  and corporate and other 
in the following segment financial data and discussions of segment results  operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses 
operating income or operating loss excludes net realized investment gains and losses and income tax 
these are considered non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures of operating revenue and operating income or operating loss differ from revenue and income loss from continuing operations before income tax as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of before tax realized investment gains and losses 
we measure segment performance excluding realized investment gains and losses because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses 
our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses  and a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
realized investment gains and losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments 
however  income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of overall profitability 
we may experience realized investment losses  which will affect future earnings levels since our underlying business is long term in nature and we need to earn the assumed interest rates in our liabilities

segment outlook during  we experienced an unfavorable impact on premium growth which we believe was caused by the uncertain economic environment 
our sales were also negatively impacted by the economy  particularly sales to existing accounts 
opportunities for premium and sales growth are expected to re emerge as the economy improves and employment growth resumes 
we expect continued volatility in net investment income during as a result of fluctuations in bond calls and other types of miscellaneous net investment income 
we intend to manage our expense levels relative to premium levels through operating effectiveness and performance management 
unum us has goodwill of approximately million at year end  none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment 
periods of economic downturns have historically affected disability claim incidence rates and  to a lesser extent  disability claim recovery rates in certain sectors of the market 
certain risks and uncertainties are inherent in disability business 
components of claims experience  such as incidence and recovery rates  may be worse than we expect 
disability claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by  among other factors  the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence 
within the group disability market  pricing and renewal actions can be taken to react to higher claim rates  but these actions take time to implement  and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices 
in addition  changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time 
the current economic downturn may lead to a higher rate of claim incidence or lower levels of claim recoveries 
we have previously taken steps to improve our risk profile  including reducing our exposure to volatile business segments through diversification by market size  product segment  and industry segment 
we believe our claims management organization is positioned for stable and sustainable performance levels 
although we did not experience significantly higher levels of disability claims incidence during  we did experience slightly elevated levels in the second half of we are uncertain as to whether the higher claim incidence is due to the normal volatility that occurs in our group disability business or is 
table of contents related to the economy 
we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risk to the economic slowdown and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly

our strategies for growth focus on i delivering product choice through an integrated  easy to manage  and flexible platform  ii providing communications to employees with a focus on education and enrollment efficiencies  iii continued expansion and improvement in distribution  and iv developing strong capabilities to cross sell  re enroll  and retain customers

we will continue to manage our value businesses  which we define as the group large case market  individual disability  and long term care product lines  in a disciplined manner for profitability 
while the recession impacted our ability to grow premium income during  we expect to achieve a slight increase in premium income during we anticipate that the benefit ratio in our group disability product line will begin to level out during we think future margin improvement is achievable  although at a slower rate of growth than was achieved for and  driven primarily by our ongoing product mix shift and the growth of our voluntary benefits product line

the decline in group long term disability premium income was partially offset by increases in premium income for group life due to higher sales and improved persistency 
net investment income decreased in relative to the prior year due primarily to a reduction in inflation which reduced the return on bonds for which interest income is linked to a uk inflation index 
these index linked bonds match the claim reserves associated with certain of our group long term disability policies that provide for inflation linked increases in disability benefits 
the decrease in net investment income attributable to these index linked bonds was generally offset by a decrease in the reserves for future claims payments related to the inflation index linked group long term disability policies 
although over the intermediate term the investment return from index linked bonds generally matches the index linked claim payments and reserves  the effect on investment income from the inflation index linked bonds may not be completely offset by lower claim payments and reserves 
the benefits reset to a higher payment when the rate of inflation increases but are not reset to a lower payment due to a decrease in the rate of inflation  whereas investment income on the inflation index linked bonds can fluctuate either positively or negatively depending on the movement in the inflation rate 

table of contents the lower benefit ratio in in comparison to the prior year was primarily due to a decline in the level of claim incidence for group long term disability as well as the impact of lower inflation on claim reserves associated with group long term disability policies containing an inflation linked benefit increase feature 
partially offsetting these items is an increase in claim incidence for the group life line of business

year ended december  compared with year ended december  premium income decreased in relative to due primarily to a decline in group long term disability resulting from lower persistency levels and lower sales 
this decline was partially offset by increases in premium income for group life due to higher sales and improved persistency and to individual disability due to the continued growth in the in force block from higher levels of sales during and a decrease in group life ceded premiums as a result of a modification  in the fourth quarter of  of a quota share reinsurance arrangement relating to new group life sales also contributed to the increase in group life premiums in compared to net investment income increased in relative to due primarily to the growth in the level of assets supporting these lines of business and a higher yield on the portfolio due to the investment of new cash at a higher yield than that of the existing portfolio

the sales growth in group life was attributable to sales growth in both the core market  which we define for unum uk as employee groups with fewer than lives  and in the large case market 
group disability also had sales increases in both market segments 
sales of group long term disability and group life were both unfavorably impacted during by lower sales to existing accounts

table of contents year ended december  compared with year ended december  the lower level of premium growth in compared to the growth rate was attributable primarily to lower sales during the first half of and lower persistency in the accident  sickness  and disability product line 
the lower persistency primarily relates to the loss of a few large policyholder accounts 
we believe our lower premium growth was partially due to the current economic conditions which affected the buying patterns of employees and caused employers to defer introduction of new plans 
net investment income increased in in comparison to the prior year due to growth in the level of assets  an increased level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities  and a higher yield on the portfolio due to the investment of new cash at a higher yield than that of the existing portfolio 
the overall benefit ratio for this segment remained stable in relative to the prior year  with a lower benefit ratio in the life and cancer and critical illness lines of business partially offset by a slightly higher benefit ratio in the accident  sickness  and disability line of business 
the life product line reported a lower benefit ratio in relative to the prior year due to a change in the mix of life business and the resulting lower change in the active life reserve 
the cancer and critical illness product line reported a lower benefit ratio in relative to the prior year due primarily to a release of active life reserves  partially offset by an increase in disabled life reserves associated with the older cancer products 
the increase in the benefit ratio in the accident  sickness and disability line of business resulted primarily from a slight increase in the claim incidence rates relative to the favorable experience of last year 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs was higher in due to the continued increase in the level of deferred acquisition costs as well as the fluctuation in amortization related to certain of our interest sensitive policies 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  growth in premium income for compared to was attributable primarily to stable persistency and an increase in sales during and net investment income increased in in comparison to due to growth in the level of assets and a higher yield on the portfolio 
the benefit ratio decreased in in comparison to due primarily to favorable risk experience in the accident  sickness  and disability line of business  offset somewhat by higher benefit ratios in the life and cancer and critical illness lines of business 
the improvement in the accident  sickness  and disability line of business resulted from favorable experience related to several new products introduced between and the life line of business benefit ratio was higher in relative to due to a higher level of death claims and a higher average claim cost 
the cancer and critical illness product line reported a higher benefit ratio in relative to due primarily to unfavorable claim experience associated with the older cancer products 
the other expense ratio for increased in comparison to due primarily to field expansion and development 

table of contents sales in millions of dollars year ended december change change accident  sickness  and disability life cancer and critical illness total sales colonial life s sales in increased percent relative to last year  with percent growth in new account sales and a decline of percent in existing account sales 
we experienced sales growth of percent in the public sector market and a slight increase in sales in the commercial market segment with more than lives 
these sales increases were partially offset by a sales decline of percent in the commercial core market segment  which we define for colonial life as employee groups with fewer than lives 
the number of new accounts in increased relative to  while the new account annualized sales premium per case sold declined 
colonial life s sales increased in the commercial core market segment as compared to sales levels 
partially offsetting this increase was a decrease in sales in the commercial market segment for employee groups with more than lives and a decrease in the public sector markets for state and federal governments 
the number of new accounts and the new account annualized sales premium per case sold both increased in over segment outlook during  economic conditions had an unfavorable impact on existing account sales and on premium growth  and we expect this trend may continue in the near term if current economic conditions persist and continue to affect employment growth  the buying patterns of employees  and the deferral by employers of the introduction of new employee benefit plans 
periods of economic downturns have historically had minimal impact on the risk results of colonial life  due primarily to a diversified product portfolio that is designed with short duration  indemnity benefits 
during  we did not experience a significant increase in claim incidence levels in the aggregate or in any particular market sector 
we continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risk to an economic slowdown or recession and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly 
given the general stability and consistency of our risk results  we intend to continue to concentrate on developing our agency distribution system and implementing marketing strategies to accelerate sales growth 
we believe our value proposition  through which we serve as benefits counselors for employers and employees and as a single source for benefits communication  voluntary insurance products  and enrollment services  is well positioned for changes in the voluntary market 
our growth strategy will focus on i distribution expansion and effectiveness  ii benefits communication  primarily through one to one enrollment  iii targeted marketing programs to accelerate new account growth and better penetrate existing accounts  and iv balanced growth in our market segments 
during  we will continue with our commitment to fostering our risk management culture while we seek to further expand our market opportunities 
while we expect sales and premium growth to be modest in the near term  strong profit margins are expected to continue 
we believe sales and premium growth will reaccelerate as the economy improves and employment growth resumes

year ended december  compared with year ended december  the decrease in premium income for relative to the prior year is due to the expected run off of this block of closed business due to lower persistency and policy maturities 
net investment income decreased in relative to the prior year due to lower interest rates on floating rate assets as well as a lower level of assets supporting this closed 
table of contents block of business  partially offset by an increased level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities 
we also received fewer bond call premiums and consent fees during compared to other income  which includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business and the net investment income of portfolios held by those ceding companies to support the block we have reinsured  increased slightly compared to the prior year due to favorable experience in the reinsured blocks 
the interest adjusted loss ratio for declined slightly relative to the prior year due to higher claim recoveries 
interest and debt expense decreased from the prior year due to lower rates of interest on our floating rate debt issued by northwind holdings and a decrease in the amount of outstanding debt resulting from principal repayments 
the other expense ratio increased slightly in when compared to due primarily to the decline in premium income 
included in other expenses is a million litigation settlement 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  the decrease in premium income for relative to is due to the expected run off of this block of closed business due to persistency and policy maturities 
net investment income decreased in compared to due to a decrease in bond call premiums  a lower level of assets  and a decline in the portfolio yield for this segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an intercompany reinsurance transaction which allowed us to release excess statutory capital previously supporting this reinsured closed block of business 
as a result  the capital allocated to our individual disability closed block segment declined  with a resulting decrease in net investment income due to the lower asset levels needed to support allocated capital 
because this is an intercompany reinsurance arrangement  reported results remain unchanged for this segment other than the lower net investment income 
other income declined in relative to  primarily due to a lower level of assets and the resulting lower level of net investment income on certain blocks of business we have reinsured 
the interest adjusted loss ratio was lower in compared to  excluding the decrease in our claim reassessment reserve estimate  due primarily to lower average size of new claims and fewer reopened claims 
interest and debt expense on the debt issued in the fourth quarter of is higher in because it represents a full year of expense compared to a partial year of expense in the other expense ratio is higher for relative to due to a million litigation settlement as well as higher legal fees related to two pending cases 
segment outlook we expect that this segment may experience volatility in net investment income due to the variability in interest rates on floating rate assets and also due to a reduced level of bond call premiums relative to historical levels 
a portion of the volatility in interest income will be offset by commensurate changes in the interest expense on our floating rate debt 
we expect that operating revenue and income will continue to decline over time as this closed block of business winds down 
we believe that the interest adjusted loss ratio for this block of business will be relatively flat over the long term  but the segment may experience quarterly volatility 
claim resolution rates  which measure the resolution of claims from recovery  deaths  settlements  and benefit expirations  are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile 
our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period 
it is possible that variability in our reserve assumptions could result in a material impact on our reserve levels

segment outlook the general economic outlook for corporate bond defaults continues to be high relative to historical levels 
we have tested whether our capital plans have sufficient cushion to absorb possible losses 
we believe the current level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies as well as the level of our statutory risk based capital position us well for the current economic environment 
it is possible  however  that defaults in our investment portfolio will result in realized investment losses  reduced net investment income  and lower statutory capital 
depending on the magnitude of defaults  it is possible that we would need to seek external financing 
during  we will continue our disciplined approach to growth and risk management 
we expect our capital to continue to build as we take a conservative approach to capital deployment and seek to retain significant financial flexibility 
interest and debt expense will be higher in as compared to due to the issuance of debt on september   as previously discussed

investments overview our investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector 
we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur 
we believe our portfolio is positioned to moderate the potential impact on our financial position and operating results from a continuing economic slowdown 
we have no exposure to subprime mortgages  alt a loans  or collateralized debt obligations in our asset backed or mortgage backed securities portfolios 
at december   we held million fair value million amortized cost of collateralized debt obligations within our public bond portfolio 
we had million fair value million amortized cost of exposure to investments for which the payment of interest and principal is guaranteed under a financial guaranty insurance policy 
the weighted average rating of the underlying securities  absent the guaranty insurance policy  is a we held million fair value million amortized cost of perpetual debentures  or hybrid securities  that generally have no fixed maturity date 
interest on these securities due on any payment date may be deferred by the issuer 
the interest payments are generally deferrable only to the extent that the issuer has suspended dividends or other distributions or payments to any of its shareholders or any other perpetual debt instrument 
below is a summary of our formal investment policy  including the overall quality and diversification objectives the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our portfolios 
the long term nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns 
a maximum of percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below investment grade securities  percent in equity type instruments  up to percent in private placements  and percent in commercial mortgage loans 
the remaining assets can be held in 
table of contents publicly traded investment grade corporate securities  mortgage backed securities  bank loans  asset backed securities  government and government agencies  and municipal securities 
we intend to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities  in the aggregate  to within a range of ten percent of the liability duration 
the weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be baa or higher 
the maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries and is more restrictive than the five percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments our insurance subsidiaries are allowed to own 
these internal limits are as follows rating internal limit in millions aaa a bbb bbb bbb bb bb bb b the portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines 
derivative instruments may be used to replicate permitted asset classes  hedge interest rate risk and foreign currency risk  and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us  reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors  and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
the allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification  on a weekly basis  by an investment subcommittee appointed by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries 
these actions are also reviewed by the finance committee of unum group s board of directors on a quarterly basis 
we review these investment policies and guidelines annually  or more frequently if deemed necessary  and recommend adjustments  as appropriate

investment results net investment income was  million in  a decrease of percent relative to the weaker pound in relative to unfavorably affected translated results for net investment income 
during  we also received lower investment income on bonds in unum uk for which interest income is linked to a uk inflation index  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease in net investment income was largely offset by lower claim reserves due to lower claim payments which are also linked to inflation 
in addition  we earned lower interest rates on our floating rate invested assets during  largely offset by lower interest expense on our floating rate debt 
we also received fewer bond call premiums and consent fees during compared to the prior year 
somewhat mitigating the impact of these items is continued growth in the level of invested assets  an increase in the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities  and an increase in our portfolio yield due to the investment of new cash at higher rates than that of the prior year

during the first quarter of  the company borrowed billion against its lines of credit and completed a tender exchange offer to improve its near term debt maturity profile 
continued signs that the company s operations weakened materially in the first quarter  as well as the continued weakness in the economy at that time  led us to believe that covenant violations could occur in the near future

during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on securities issued by a uk financial institution 
the decline in value of the securities is primarily the result of the global credit crisis and the slowdown in the economy 
in addition  this financial institution made a major acquisition during the peak of the past credit cycle 
the financial institution then had to recognize impairments on loans and other assets held by the acquired company  resulting in the need for additional capital 
this capital was initially provided by shareholders and others  but as the economic environment further deteriorated  the financial institution participated in the government guarantee of senior debt  capital injections  and an asset protection scheme

at the time of the impairment loss  the decline in the s p index had not been significant enough to trigger the substitution of the highly rated bonds  but due to the then recent steep decline in the s p index  we could no longer conclude that the value of the underlying s p index mutual fund would equate to or exceed the par value of the security at maturity

although at the time of the impairment loss the company had not yet received government bailout money  the probability of receiving some form of government financial aid had significantly increased 
other us automakers that had received bailout money were expected to request their bondholders to accept a significant reduction in principal

these financial results increased the likelihood that the company might violate bank covenants and seek waivers from its bondholders

table of contents during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on bonds issued by a large media company 
the company was the subject of a leveraged buyout that placed a large amount of debt on the balance sheet during because of our outlook for the future business prospects of this issuer  the length of time these securities had been in an unrealized loss position  and a change in our intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover  we determined that an other than temporary impairment had occurred 
these securities were investment grade at the time of purchase but were downgraded to below investment grade in the second quarter of at the time of the impairment  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years 
during  we recognized losses of million related to the decline in fair value below amortized cost for certain securities for which it was determined during the third quarter of that we no longer had the intent to hold to recovery or maturity due to anticipated changes in our capital requirements resulting from the reinsurance transactions involving our individual disability closed block segment business and the related issuance of million of notes  as well as our capital redeployment plans

we had no individual realized investments losses million or greater from the sale of fixed maturity securities during embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement we report changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement as realized investment gains and losses  as required under the provisions of gaap 
gaap requires us to include in our realized investment gains and losses a calculation intended to estimate the value of the option of our reinsurance counterparty to cancel the reinsurance contract with us 
however  neither party can unilaterally terminate the reinsurance agreement except in extreme circumstances resulting from regulatory supervision  delinquency proceedings  or 
table of contents other direct regulatory action 
cash settlements or collateral related to this embedded derivative are not required at any time during the reinsurance contract or at termination of the reinsurance contract  and any accumulated embedded derivative gain or loss reduces to zero over time as the reinsured business winds down 
we therefore view the effect of realized gains and losses recognized for this embedded derivative as a reporting requirement that will not result in a permanent change in assets or stockholders equity 
the changes in fair value of this embedded derivative recognized as realized gains and losses during  and resulted primarily from a change in credit spreads in the overall investment market

at december   our mortgage asset backed securities had an average life of years  effective duration of years  and a weighted average credit rating of aaa 
the mortgage asset backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services 
the primary risk involved in investing in mortgage asset backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment 
we use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
the timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income 
we recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities 
actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically  and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected 
the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis  and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income 

table of contents we have not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only  or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
all of our mortgage backed securities have fixed rate coupons 
the credit quality of our mortgage backed securities portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the recent issues in the market concerning subprime mortgage loans 
the change in value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio has moved in line with that of prime agency backed mortgage backed securities 
as of december   the amortized cost and fair value of our below investment grade fixed maturity securities was  million and  million  respectively 
below investment grade securities are inherently more risky than investment grade securities since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
additional downgrades may occur  but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in below investment grade securities  nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity 
mortgage loans our mortgage loan portfolio was  million and  million on an amortized cost basis at december  and  respectively 
our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans 
we expect that we will continue to add investments in this category either through the secondary market or through loan originations 
we believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types 
the incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low 
due to conservative underwriting  we expect the level of problem loans to remain low relative to the industry 
at december   we held one mortgage loan which was delinquent more than days as to interest or principal payments and which we consider impaired 
this loan is carried at the estimated net realizable value of million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
at december   impaired mortgage loans totaled million 
we had no valuation allowance for mortgage loans at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussion of our investments 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment risk  duration  and currency risk 
historically  we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps  current and forward currency swaps  interest rate forward contracts  forward treasury locks  currency forward contracts  and forward contracts on specific fixed income securities 
our current credit exposure on derivatives  which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held  was million at december  the carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was million at december  we believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties  all of whom are rated a or better by both moody s and s p 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments 
other our exposure to non current investments  defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest and or principal payments  totaled million and million on a fair value basis at december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations  principally in our insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
debt and or securities offerings provide an additional source of liquidity 
cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  and taxes  as well as purchases of new investments 

table of contents we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations 
we attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business 
however  deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner  which may negatively impact our cash flows 
furthermore  if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries  this will negatively impact statutory capital  which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies 
a reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay our stockholder dividends or meet our debt and other payment obligations 
our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments  and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities 
a decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations 
however  our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is consistent  even during cycles of economic downturns  which serves to minimize liquidity risk 
we have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by erisa 
we made a voluntary contribution of million to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan in february we do not anticipate making any additional contributions during we have estimated our future funding requirements under the pension protection act of and do not believe that the funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
we also contribute to our uk pension plan sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation 
we anticipate that we will make a contribution of approximately million during we issued million of senior notes against our open shelf registration on september  in the near term  we expect that our need for external financing is small  but changes in our business as noted above could increase our need 
we previously had a million unsecured revolving credit facility that expired in december we believe our cash resources are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next months and that our current level of holding company liquidity can be utilized to mitigate potential losses from defaults 
during  we intend to retain a level of capital in our traditional us insurance subsidiaries such that we maintain a weighted average rbc well above capital adequacy requirements 
we also expect unum limited to operate above fsa capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins 
consolidated cash flows our cash flows from discontinued operations are combined with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow statement category in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations did not materially affect liquidity and capital resources 
operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million and  million for the comparable periods of and  respectively 
operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income  offset by payments of claims  commissions  expenses  and income taxes 
premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales  but on renewals of existing business  renewal price increases  and stable persistency 
investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and on the level of portfolio yield rates 
the level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business 
the level of paid claims is due partially to the growth and aging of the block of business and also to the general economy  as previously discussed in the operating results by segment 
operating cash flows for   and include pension contributions of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
we also had increased cash inflows of approximately million in due to the reinsurance recapture of a small block of individual disability business 

table of contents the fluctuation in the income tax adjustment to reconcile and net income to net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to changes in the deferred tax asset related to the change in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement 
the decrease in the other  net adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities in compared to is due primarily to the reclassification of costs related to early retirement of debt to cash flows from financing activities 
investing cash flows investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments 
investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments 
net cash used by investing activities was  million for the year ended december  compared to million and  million for the comparable periods of and  respectively 
proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities in were lower than primarily due to lower sales of fixed maturity securities  a decrease in bond maturities and bonds that were called at par  and the translation of investment proceeds from our uk operations at lower exchange rates 
proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities in were consistent with the level of primarily due to an increase in bond maturities and bonds that were called at par  offset by a decrease in sales of fixed maturity securities  a lower level of proceeds from mortgage backed securities prepayments  and the translation of investment proceeds from our uk operations at lower exchange rates 
proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments increased in primarily due to an increase in sales of other long term investments and an increase in proceeds from terminations of derivatives within our cash flow hedging programs 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in proceeds from commercial mortgage loan maturities and prepayments 
proceeds from sales and maturities of other investments decreased in relative to primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of common stock investments and a reduction in commercial mortgage loan maturities and prepayments 
the reduction in cash flows received from sales and maturities of other investments was partially offset by higher proceeds in from terminations of derivatives within our cash flow hedging programs 
purchases of available for sale securities decreased during relative to this decrease resulted from fewer funds available for reinvestment as compared to the prior year due to the lower level of proceeds from sales of available for sale securities and from the lower exchange rate for translation of purchases within our uk operations 
purchases of available for sale securities decreased during relative to due to the lower exchange rate for translation of purchases within our uk operations and to investing more heavily in short term investments rather than fixed maturity securities during the last half of during the first half of  we invested more heavily in fixed maturity securities as we continued to transition out of short term investments into floating rate fixed maturity securities to support the floating rate debt issued during the fourth quarter of purchases of available for sale securities in included the investing of the net cash inflows of million from the sale of genex and the million in cash inflows from the reinsurance recapture 
purchases of other investments primarily relate to mortgage loans 
net sales of short term investments decreased during relative to due to the sale of investments during to help fund the million accelerated share repurchase agreements executed one half in each of january and august  as well as the transition to floating rate fixed maturity securities in lieu of short term investments 
this decrease in proceeds was partially offset by the transition of our portfolio out of short term investments into fixed maturity securities during net sales of short term investments increased during due to the sale of investments to fund the million accelerated share repurchase agreements executed during and due to the transition to floating rate fixed maturity securities in lieu of short term investments during the first half of short term investment activity in included the investment of a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of million shares of common stock 
during  we issued million of debt and invested the proceeds in floating rate bonds and short term investments 
short term investments were used as an interim investment as we sought suitable floating rate investments to support the floating rate debt

proceeds from the disposition of business in relate to the sale of genex 
financing cash flows financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt  issuance or repurchase of common stock  and dividends paid to stockholders 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used of  million and net cash provided of million for the comparable periods of and  respectively 
net short term debt repayments in consist of the purchase and retirement of the remaining million of our notes and the repayment of million of reverse repurchase agreements outstanding at december  net short term debt repayments in are comprised of the purchase and retirement of the remaining million of our senior notes and million of our notes  less the issuance of million of reverse repurchase agreements

cash available from subsidiaries unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders  to pay debt obligations  and or to pay expenses 
these payments by our insurance and non insurance subsidiaries may take the form of interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary  operating and investment management fees  and or dividends 
during  unum group received million from an insurance subsidiary for the repayment of a surplus debenture issued to unum group in with a maturity date of october restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of ordinary dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities 
for life insurance companies domiciled in the united states  that limitation generally equals  depending on the state of domicile  either ten percent of an insurer s statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations  excluding realized investment gains and losses  of the preceding year 

table of contents the payment of ordinary dividends to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries is generally further limited to the amount of statutory surplus as it relates to policyholders 
although it is unlikely we will utilize the entire amount of available dividends  based on the restrictions under current law  million is available during for the payment of ordinary dividends to unum group from its traditional us insurance subsidiaries  excluding northwind reinsurance company northwind re and tailwind reinsurance company tailwind re 
northwind holdings and tailwind holdings ability to meet their debt payment obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of dividends from northwind re and tailwind re  respectively 
the ability of northwind re and tailwind re to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the reinsured business 
unum group and or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from its united kingdom based affiliate  unum limited  subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the united kingdom 
approximately million is available for the payment of dividends from unum limited during  subject to regulatory approval 
however  in order to preserve unum limited s capital at a reasonable level  it is unlikely that we will utilize the entire amount available during the amount available during for the payment of ordinary dividends from unum group s traditional us insurance subsidiaries was million  of which million was declared and paid 
the traditional us insurance subsidiaries also paid extraordinary dividends of million in the amount available during from unum limited was million  of which million was declared and paid 
during  northwind re received regulatory approval from the insurance department of its state of domicile to pay dividends of million to northwind holdings  and tailwind re received regulatory approval from the insurance department of its state of domicile to pay dividends of million to tailwind holdings 
the payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary s board of directors 
the ability of unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval generally depends on the level of earnings of those insurance subsidiaries as calculated under law 
in addition to regulatory restrictions  the amount of dividends that may be paid by insurance subsidiaries will depend on additional factors  such as rbc ratios  funding growth objectives at an affiliate level  and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings 
insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non insurance subsidiaries except where the non insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by unum group 
unum group s rbc ratio for its traditional us insurance subsidiaries  calculated on a weighted average basis using the naic company action level formula  was approximately percent at the end of  with the individual rbc ratios for unum group s principal traditional us insurance subsidiaries all in excess of percent 
the individual rbc ratios for northwind re and tailwind re  our special purpose financial captive insurance companies  are calculated using the naic company action level formula and have target levels of percent 
the rbc ratios for northwind re and tailwind re each exceeded the percent target level at the end of the individual rbc ratio for each of our insurance subsidiaries is above the range that would require state regulatory action

there are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt obligations 
during  moody s issued a ratings downgrade from a to baa on the debt rating of the non recourse debt issued by northwind holdings  which will cause an increase in the fee paid to the third party guarantor on northwind holdings debt 
the increase in this fee is not material to our earnings on a consolidated basis or to earnings for the individual disability closed block segment 
also during  moody s

policyholder liability maturities and the related reinsurance recoverable represent the projected payout of the current in force policyholder liabilities and the expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties as to the timing and amount of claim payments 
we utilize extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the in force business 
the primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are claim incidence rates for mortality and morbidity  claim resolution rates  persistency rates  and interest rates 
these cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of the projected claim payments

table of contents ratings am best  fitch  moody s  and s p are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to unum group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries 
issuer credit ratings reflect an agency s opinion of the overall financial capacity of a company to meet its senior debt obligations 
financial strength ratings are specific to each individual insurance subsidiary and reflect each rating agency s view of the overall financial strength capital levels  earnings  growth  investments  business mix  operating performance  and market position of the insuring entity and its ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
both the issuer credit ratings and financial strength ratings incorporate quantitative and qualitative analyses by rating agencies and are routinely reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis 
we compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies 
a downgrade of our financial strength ratings can be expected to adversely affect us and could potentially  among other things  adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force  negatively impact persistency and new sales  particularly large case group sales and individual sales  and generally adversely affect our ability to compete 
a downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to unum group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital

table of contents agency ratings are not directed toward the holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold our securities 
each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be regarded as an independent assessment  not conditional on any other rating 
given the dynamic nature of the ratings process  changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near term 
based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our improved insurance risk profile  our financial flexibility  our operating performance  and the quality of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any negative actions from any of the four rating agencies related to either unum group s current issuer credit ratings or the financial strength ratings of its insurance subsidiaries 
however  in the event that we are unable to meet the rating agency specific guideline values to maintain our current ratings  including but not limited to maintenance of our capital management metrics at the threshold values stated and maintenance of our financial flexibility and operational consistency  we could be placed on a negative credit watch  with a potential for a downgrade to both our issuer credit ratings and our financial strength ratings 
see ratings contained herein in item and risk factors contained herein in item a for further discussion 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to various market risk exposures  including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
see investments contained herein in item and notes   and of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate changes results from our holdings of financial instruments such as fixed rate investments  derivatives  and interest sensitive liabilities 
fixed rate investments include fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  policy loans  and short term investments 
fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities  and redeemable preferred stock  all of which are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
certain of our financial instruments  fixed maturity securities and derivatives  are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of these financial instruments may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates may increase the net unrealized loss related to these financial instruments  but may improve our ability to earn higher rates of return on new purchases of fixed maturity securities 
conversely  a decline in interest rates may decrease the net unrealized loss  but new securities may be purchased at lower rates of return 
although changes in fair value of fixed maturity securities and derivatives due to changes in interest rates may impact amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets  these changes will not cause an economic gain or loss unless we sell investments  terminate derivative positions  determine that an investment is other than temporarily impaired  or determine that a derivative instrument is no longer an effective hedge 
other fixed rate investments  such as mortgage loans and policy loans  are carried at amortized cost and unpaid balances  respectively  rather than fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
these investments may have fair values substantially higher or lower than the carrying values reflected in our balance sheets 
a change in interest rates could impact our financial position if we sold our mortgage loan investments at times of low market value 
a change in interest rates would not impact our financial position at repayment of policy loans  as ultimately the cash surrender values or death benefits would be reduced for the carrying value of any outstanding policy loans 
carrying amounts for short term investments approximate fair value  and we believe we have minimal interest rate risk exposure from these investments 
we believe that the risk of being forced to liquidate investments or terminate derivative positions is minimal  primarily due to the level of capital at our insurance subsidiaries  the level of cash and marketable securities at our holding companies  and our investment strategy which we believe provides for adequate cash flows to meet the funding requirements of our business 
we may in certain circumstances  however  need to sell investments due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements  changes in tax laws  rating agency decisions  and or unexpected changes in liquidity needs 
although the majority of our liabilities related to insurance contracts are not interest rate sensitive and we therefore have minimal exposure to policy withdrawal risk  the fair values of liabilities under all insurance contracts are taken into consideration in our overall management of interest rate risk  which minimizes exposure to changing interest rates through the matching of investment cash flows with amounts due under insurance contracts 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match and our asset and liability duration match to mitigate interest rate risk 
we model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows us to choose what we believe to be the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to our activities in derivative financial instruments 
we use current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  forward treasury locks  and 
table of contents forward contracts on specific fixed income securities to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
short term and long term debt are not carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
if we modify or replace existing short term or long term debt instruments at current market rates  we may incur a gain or loss on the transaction 
we believe our debt related risk to changes in interest rates is relatively minimal 
in the near term  we expect that our need for external financing is small  but changes in our business could increase our need 
we measure our financial instruments market risk related to changes in interest rates using a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates potential changes in fair values as of december  and based on a hypothetical immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels 
the selection of a basis point immediate parallel change in interest rates should not be construed as our prediction of future market events  but only as an illustration of the potential effect of such an event 
the hypothetical potential changes in fair value of our financial instruments at december  and are shown as follows december  notional hypothetical in millions of dollars amount of derivatives fair value fv bp change in fv assets fixed maturity securities mortgage loans policy loans  net of reinsurance ceded liabilities unrealized adjustment to reserves  net of reinsurance ceded and other long term debt derivatives swaps forwards embedded derivative in modified coinsurance arrangement 
table of contents december  notional hypothetical in millions of dollars amount of derivatives fair value fv bp change in fv assets fixed maturity securities mortgage loans policy loans  net of reinsurance ceded liabilities unrealized adjustment to reserves  net of reinsurance ceded and other short term debt long term debt derivatives swaps forwards embedded derivative in modified coinsurance arrangement these assets and liabilities are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates may affect the fair value at which the item is reported in our consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding offsetting change reported in other comprehensive income or loss  net of deferred taxes 
the adjustment to reserves and other for unrealized investment gains and losses reflects the adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and policyholder liabilities that would be necessary if the unrealized investment gains and losses related to the fixed maturity securities and derivatives had been realized 
changes in this adjustment are also reported as a component of other comprehensive income or loss  net of deferred taxes 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of basis points in interest rates 
the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgage backed securities was estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgage backed securities 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values shown in the chart above for all other items were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because we actively manage our investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
foreign currency risk the functional currency of our uk operations is the british pound sterling 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rates primarily as they relate to the translation of the financial results of our uk operations 
fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate have an effect on our reported financial results 
we do not hedge against the possible impact of this risk 
because we do not actually convert pounds into dollars except for a limited number of transactions  we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting issue and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the uk assuming the pound to dollar exchange rate decreased percent from the december  and levels  stockholders equity as reported in us dollars as of and for the periods then ended would have been lower by approximately million and million  respectively 
assuming the pound to dollar average exchange rate 
table of contents decreased percent from the actual average exchange rates for and  segment operating income  which excludes net realized investment gains and losses and income tax  as reported in us dollars would have decreased approximately million and million  respectively  for the years then ended 
dividends paid by unum limited are generally held at our uk finance subsidiary 
if these funds are repatriated to our us holding company  we would at that time be subject to foreign currency risk as the value of the dividend  when converted into us dollars  would be dependent upon the foreign exchange rate at the time of conversion 
we are also exposed to foreign currency risk related to certain foreign investment securities denominated in local currencies and us dollar denominated debt issued by one of our uk subsidiaries 
we use current and forward currency swaps and currency forward contracts to hedge or minimize the foreign exchange risk associated with these instruments 
see unum uk segment contained herein in item for further information concerning foreign currency translation 
risk management as an insurer  we are in the business of risk management 
effectively taking and managing risks is essential to the success of our company 
to facilitate this effort  we have an enterprise risk management erm program 
our erm program strives to identify  measure  mitigate  and report on our risk positions and exposures  including notable risk events  assess material risks  including how they affect us  how individual risks interrelate  and how management addresses these risks  practice strong risk management  including diversification across and within business units and systematic limit monitoring  identify emerging risks and analyze how material future risks might affect us  and fulfill regulatory  rating agency  and governance objectives 
through adherence to these objectives  we believe we are better positioned to fulfill our corporate mission  improve and protect stockholder value  and reduce reputational risk 
our approach to risk management is defined by these fundamental principles our risk management strategy begins with our business strategy 
we are a specialty insurance carrier focused on providing benefits through employer sponsored plans 
we have market leadership positions in the product lines we offer and more than years of experience 
this combination of focused expertise and deep experience is the foundation of our approach to risk management 
risk management cannot be successful in a vacuum  it needs to be embedded in daily decision making throughout the organization 
unum group s board members and our senior leaders clearly acknowledge that risk management is critical to our company s long term success  and this theme cascades through the work of risk committees and the management team 
additionally  we believe the individual and collective decisions of our employees play a key role in successfully managing our overall risk profile 
we closely monitor emerging risks  adjust our strategies as appropriate  and hold capital levels which provide financial flexibility 
we use qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify emerging risks and develop mitigating strategies to limit our exposure to existing and potential risks 
we utilize stress testing and scenario analysis to shape our business  financial  and strategic planning activities 
for example  stress testing of our capital and liquidity management strategies enables us to identify areas of high exposure  assess mitigating actions  develop contingency plans  and guide decisions around our capital and liquidity 
table of contents levels 
in addition  scenario analysis is used as input in the development of our business and strategic planning processes 
risk committee structure and role we have a pyramid risk committee structure in place to govern our erm process 
unum group s board of directors has broad responsibility for risk management  with the audit committee having principal oversight of the risk management program 
our chief risk officer regularly reports to the audit committee and also to the full board of directors  as appropriate 
an executive risk management committee is responsible for overseeing our enterprise wide risk management program 
the chief risk officer  who is a member of the executive risk management committee  has primary responsibility for our erm program and is supported by a corporate risk committee and by the risk committees of the three primary operating segments that comprise unum group 
operating segment risk committees for unum us  unum uk  and colonial life oversee risk specific to their business 
these committees are responsible for identifying  measuring  reporting  and managing insurance and operational risks within their respective areas  consistent with corporate guidance 
the corporate risk committee oversees the operational  investment  and capital management subcommittees and reviews risk on a corporate level 
market and credit risk are jointly managed by the investment committee 
the capital management committee is responsible for monitoring and planning capital allocation  financing  and liquidity 
in addition to the formal communication channels included in the risk committee structure  we provide ways for employees to report risk directly to the chief risk officer  and we educate employees on company risks 
governance  risk  and compliance we employ a decentralized risk management model under which risk based decisions are made daily on a local level 
to achieve long term success  we believe risk management must be the responsibility of all employees 
we strive for a culture of accountability  risk management  and strict compliance  and we believe these values allow our employees to feel comfortable identifying issues as well as taking ownership for addressing potential problems 
the recent recession and financial sector problems have reinforced the importance of effective governance  risk management  and compliance 
we rely on four complementary functions 
internal controls provide reasonable assurance that there are controls in place to prevent and detect a material misstatement in our financial reporting  internal audits assess the effectiveness of controls for operational business processes and monitor compliance with internal policies and procedures  our compliance organization seeks to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and is responsible for directing our ethics program and privacy efforts  and the erm program serves as an umbrella and takes a holistic view of risks and risk management efforts across the enterprise 
these groups work closely together to align their plans  activities  and efforts toward the common goal of effective governance  risk  and compliance
