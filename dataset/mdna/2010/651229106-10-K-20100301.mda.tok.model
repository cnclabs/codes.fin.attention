in may  the company completed cash tender offers to repurchase million of the million aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes due december and million of the million aggregate outstanding principal amount of notes due may in december  the company repaid the remaining million principal amount outstanding of the million medium term notes due december as of december   the company had million of short term debt  including million of medium term notes that mature in may and a million principal payment due on the term loan in september in addition  because the closing sale price of the company s common stock exceeded for more than of the last consecutive trading days in the three months ended december   the convertible senior notes are convertible at the election of the holders of the notes at any time during the three months ended march  since conversion of the notes is outside the control of the company  the carrying value of the convertible senior notes  million  is classified as current portion of long term debt in the consolidated balance sheet at december  reset notes in july  the company issued million of medium term notes  maturing in july with interest payable semiannually the reset notes 
the reset notes contained a coupon rate reset feature occurring at two ten year intervals  july and july the reset notes contained a coupon rate of through the first interest reset date of july in addition  the reset notes contained an embedded remarketing option pursuant to which a third party could call the reset notes at par at the end of each ten year remarketing interval  and the third party or another securities dealer could remarket the reset notes at a reset coupon rate which would result in the third party realizing proceeds for the remarketed notes in an amount approximately equal to the discounted present value of a million ten year note with a coupon of  discounted at the ten year treasury note yield to maturity prevailing at the time of remarketing 
in the event the remarketing option at the end of each remarketing interval was not exercised  the reset note holders were required to put the reset notes back to the company at a price of par 
the embedded remarketing option was accounted for separately  as it was deemed a purchase by the company of a transferable  freestanding call option from the reset note investors and the company s concurrent transfer of the freestanding call option to the third party 
as a result  the remarketing option  which provided for the call and remarketing of the reset notes  was in effect a contract between the third party and the reset note holders that allowed the third party to call the reset notes from the holders at par at the end of each ten year remarketing interval and remarket the reset notes 
the fair value of the remarketing option purchased by the company from the reset note investors at the date of issuance was determined based on the amount the third party paid the company for the remarketing option 
in summary  at issuance the company was cash neutral with respect to the remarketing option but implicitly issued the reset notes at a premium because the investors purchased the reset notes from the company simultaneous with the company purchasing the remarketing option from the investors which the company concurrently monetized by selling it to a third party 
as a result  the reset notes carried a premium at issuance  and the company recognized no gain or loss upon issuance of the reset notes 
in connection with the issuance of the reset notes in july  the company entered into an agreement with the third party that afforded the company the right to purchase the remarketing option from the third party at the end of each ten year remarketing interval at its then fair value in order to avoid the remarketing of the reset notes 
the company exercised this right in july to avoid the third party calling and remarketing the reset notes 
the company redeemed the million of reset notes in july because prevailing interest rates as of the july remarketing date would have resulted in the third party exercising the remarketing 
table of contents option and calling the reset notes at par  and the reset notes subsequently being remarketed 
the reset notes would have been remarketed at a premium to par in order for the third party to realize the discounted present value described above in the remarketing 
a note priced at a premium to par would carry a coupon rate greater than the rate carried by a security priced at par 
accordingly  the coupon rate arising from a potential remarketing was estimated to approximate  exceeding the company s then incremental borrowing rate of for comparable debt 
to achieve a lower net cost of borrowing  in july  the company redeemed the reset notes and recorded a loss on extinguishment of the reset notes of million associated with the purchase of the embedded remarketing option from the third party 
the company did not have any reset notes outstanding as of december  pension obligations the company has adopted and sponsors pension plans in the us and in various other countries 
the company s ongoing funding requirements for its pension plans are largely dependent on the value of each of the plan s assets and the investment returns realized on plan assets 
in  the company made a million voluntary cash contribution to its primary us defined benefit pension plan in order to improve the overall funded status of the plan 
the company expects to contribute approximately million to its pension plans in future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent on changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets 
the company determines its plan asset investment mix  in part  on the duration of each plan s liabilities 
to the extent each plan s assets decline in value or do not generate the returns expected by the company  the company may be required to make contributions to the pension plans to ensure the pension obligations are adequately funded as required by law or mandate 
dividends in the first quarter of  the company reduced the quarterly dividend payable on its common stock from per share to per share to improve liquidity and maintain its current investment grade credit rating 
the payment of dividends to holders of the company s common stock remains at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the company s financial condition  earnings  legal requirements and other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
credit ratings the company s credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies 
the company s current senior debt credit ratings from moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch ratings are baa  bbb and bbb  respectively 
its current short term debt credit ratings from moody s investors service  standard poor s and fitch ratings are p  a and f  respectively 
standard poor s has a stable outlook  and moody s and fitch maintain a negative outlook on their ratings 
changes in the company s operating results  cash flows or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies 
the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold the company s securities  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating

outlook for the year ending december   the company expects to generate cash flows from operations of more than million after restructuring cash payments of approximately million to million 
the company plans to fund capital expenditures of approximately million  which include expenditures associated with the implementation of sap 
overall  the company believes that available cash and cash equivalents  cash flows generated from future operations  access to capital markets  and availability under the revolver and new receivables facility will be adequate to support the cash needs of existing businesses 
the company plans to use available cash to repay debt maturities as they come due  including million of medium term notes that mature in may and a million principal payment due under the term loan in september resolution of income tax contingencies in  and  the company recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net income tax benefits as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters with the irs  the settlement of certain tax contingency reserves  the reversal of a valuation allowance  the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain tax matters and the reorganization of certain legal entities in europe 
these benefits are reflected in the company s  and consolidated statements of operations 
the ultimate resolution of outstanding tax matters may be different than that reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals  which may adversely impact future operating results and cash flows 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the company has outstanding debt obligations maturing at various dates through certain other items  such as purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of december  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following table summarizes the effect that lease and other material contractual obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the indicated period 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on borrowings outstanding as of december  additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years debt interest on debt operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations amounts represent contractual obligations based on the earliest date that the obligation may become due  excluding interest  based on borrowings outstanding as of december  the carrying value of the million of convertible senior notes is included in the table as due within one year since the convertible senior notes are convertible as of december  provisions of the convertible senior notes entitle the holders to convert their notes during specified periods if certain conditions are met  and since such conditions were met  the convertible senior notes are convertible during the quarter ended march  the convertible senior notes may be convertible in future periods and mature in march if not earlier converted 
for further information relating to these obligations  see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent estimated interest payable on borrowings outstanding as of december   excluding the impact of interest rate swaps that adjust the fixed rate to a floating rate for billion of medium term notes 
interest on floating rate debt was estimated using the rate in effect as of december  for further information  see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
amounts represent contractual minimum lease obligations on operating leases as of december  for further information relating to these obligations  see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
primarily consists of purchase commitments entered into as of december  for finished goods  raw materials  components and services pursuant to legally enforceable and binding obligations  which include all significant terms 
total does not include contractual obligations reported on the december  balance sheet as current liabilities  except for current portion of long term debt and short term debt 
the company also has liabilities for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits 
as a large taxpayer  the company is under continual audit by the irs and other taxing authorities on several open tax positions  and it is possible that the amount of the liability for uncertain tax positions and unrecognized tax benefits could change in the coming year 
while it is possible that one or more of these examinations may be resolved in the next year  the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the million in unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  at december  is excluded from the preceding table 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
additionally  the company has obligations with respect to its pension and postretirement medical benefit plans which are excluded from the preceding table 
the timing and amounts of the funding requirements are uncertain because they are dependent on interest rates and actual returns on plan assets  among other factors 
as of december   the company had liabilities related to its unfunded and underfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans of million 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents as of december   the company had million in standby letters of credit primarily related to the company s self insurance programs  including workers compensation  product liability and medical 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   the company did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are more fully described in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in that footnote  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe the company s critical accounting policies 
sales recognition sales of merchandise and freight billed to customers are recognized when title passes and all substantial risks of ownership change  which generally occurs either upon shipment or upon delivery based upon contractual terms 
sales are net of provisions for cash discounts  returns  customer discounts such as volume or trade discounts  cooperative advertising and other sales related discounts 
recovery of accounts receivable the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
when aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records reserves for bad debt for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
accounts are reviewed for potential write off on a case by case basis 
accounts deemed uncollectible are written off  net of expected recoveries 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory reserves the company reduces its inventory value for estimated obsolete and slow moving inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories  including shrink reserves  totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively  and are included in cost of products sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the company performs its impairment testing of goodwill at a reporting unit level  and all of the company s goodwill is assigned to the company s reporting units 
reporting units are one level below the operating segment level 
in connection with the company s realignment of its businesses under a global business unit gbu structure  the company redefined its reporting units  where necessary  to align with the gbu structure effective january  reporting units in the office products segment and certain reporting units in the tools  hardware commercial products segment that were geographically aligned were impacted by the realignment 
the goodwill of these geographically aligned reporting units was reallocated to reporting units defined under the gbu structure on a relative fair value basis 
the company has not had any other material changes to the reporting units identified and used to test goodwill for impairment since january  due to restructuring activities or otherwise 
acquired businesses  including goodwill arising from such transactions  are integrated into the company s existing reporting units 
after the realignment of the reporting units and the reallocation of goodwill  the company had reporting units with total goodwill of billion as of january  five of the company s reporting units accounted for approximately of the company s total goodwill 
these five reporting units were as follows baby parenting essentials  rubbermaid commercial products  industrial products services  markers  highlighters  art office organization  and office technology 
the company conducts its annual test of impairment of goodwill as of the first day of the third quarter because it generally coincides with its annual strategic planning process 
the company also tests for impairment if events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
for example  if macroeconomic factors  such as 
table of contents consumer demand and consumer confidence  deteriorate materially such that the company s reporting units projected sales and operating income decline significantly relative to previous estimates  the company will perform an interim test to assess whether goodwill is impaired 
the company determined that no interim tests of impairment were necessary during  due to declining macroeconomic conditions  significant reductions in reporting units expected sales and profitability  or otherwise 
in the company s goodwill impairment testing  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value  impairment may be present 
estimates made by management in performing its impairment testing can impact whether or not an impairment charge is necessary and the magnitude of the impairment charge to the extent one is recorded 
the company uses multiple valuation approaches in its impairment testing  each of which requires estimates to arrive at an estimate of fair value 
for the company s reporting units that are stable businesses and have a history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows  the company relies on a multiple of earnings approach to assess their fair value 
the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using this approach are the reporting units estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year and the applicable multiple to apply to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the estimated financial performance for the remainder of the year is based on the company s internal forecasting process 
to determine the ebitda multiple  the company obtains information from third parties on ebitda multiples observed for recent acquisitions and other transactions in the marketplace for comparable businesses 
the company evaluates the ebitda multiples used for the reporting units relative to the company s market capitalization plus an equity control premium 
the equity control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to the company s market value  with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the market value of the company 
the company considers premiums paid by acquirers of comparable businesses to determine the reasonableness of the implied control premium 
the ebitda multiple observed in the marketplace for recent transactions ranged from to for the annual impairment test as of july  for the july  impairment test  the company adjusted the ebitda multiples from the observed multiples  generally to multiples ranging from to so that the aggregate value of all reporting units relative to the company s total market value resulted in a reasonable implied equity control premium 
the company considers several factors in estimating the ebitda multiple applicable to each reporting unit  including the reporting unit s market position  brand awareness  gross and operating margins  and prospects for growth  among other factors 
after adjusting the ebitda multiples for the reporting units  no potential goodwill impairment was indicated for reporting units for which this approach was used 
furthermore  the company s equity market value at july  of approximately billion was significantly in excess of its book value of stockholders equity of approximately billion 
for the impairment test as of july   if each reporting unit s ebitda multiple were reduced by from the to multiple used for each reporting unit  all reporting units where the ebitda multiple approach was used to value the reporting unit would have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 
the company relies on a discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in certain circumstances  such as when the reporting unit is growing at a significantly slower rate than planned  is declining at a significantly faster rate than the overall market  has experienced significant losses  is in a stage of hyper growth  is executing significant restructuring efforts  or is in a stage of development where it has not yet fully realized the benefits of scale and operating efficiencies 
the company used the discounted cash flow approach to value three of its reporting units for the annual impairment test as of july   industrial products services  everyday writing and fine writing  because these reporting units are executing significant restructuring projects or the reporting unit s financial results are significantly impacted by economic cycles 
the material assumptions used to value a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow approach are the future financial performance and cash flows of the reporting unit  the discount rate  and the working capital investment required 
estimates of future financial performance include estimates of future sales growth rates  raw material costs  currency fluctuations  and operating efficiencies to be realized 
the company determines a discount rate based on an estimate of a reasonable risk adjusted return an investor would expect to realize on an investment in the reporting unit 
in using the discounted cash flow approach to value reporting units in  the company generally used average compound long term sales growth rates ranging from to  average operating margins ranging from to  and discount rates ranging from to 
the company concluded these three reporting units passed step one of the goodwill impairment test based on the values determined using the discounted cash flow approach 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the company measures the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  based on the estimated fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and estimates the implied fair value of goodwill 
the company identifies unrecognized intangible assets  such as trade names and customer relationships  and uses discounted cash flow models to estimate the values of the reporting unit s recognized and unrecognized intangible assets 
the estimated values of the reporting unit s intangible assets and net tangible assets are deducted from the reporting unit s total fair value to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the discount rates used to estimate the fair value of the industrial products services  everyday writing and fine writing reporting units increased basis points  the estimated fair values of the reporting units would have declined by million  million  and million  respectively 
if the discount rates were increased by basis points  all three reporting units would still have passed step one of the goodwill impairment test 

table of contents the company has one reporting unit  baby parenting essentials  whose estimated fair value at july  exceeded net assets by less than of the reporting unit s net assets using the adjusted ebitda multiple or discounted cash flow value  as applicable 
the baby parenting essentials reporting unit has goodwill of million as of july  if the ebitda multiple used to estimate the fair value of baby parenting essentials reporting unit were reduced by  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit would have been approximately less than the net assets of the reporting unit 
additional valuation procedures would have been required to determine whether baby parenting essentials goodwill was impaired  and to the extent goodwill was impaired  the magnitude of the impairment charge 
the company continues to implement specific restructuring projects and business and operational strategies to further strengthen the profitability of baby parenting essentials 
the company continues to monitor whether these initiatives are being executed as planned and improve its financial performance 
to the extent the company is not successful in implementing these projects and strategies  it is possible the company would record goodwill impairment charges associated with baby parenting essentials in future periods 
baby parenting essentials has been adversely impacted by recently enacted child safety legislation in north america and continues to integrate two acquired international businesses 
baby parenting essentials has undertaken and is executing restructuring projects to reduce supply chain costs and administrative overhead worldwide and has taken steps to minimize the impact inflation has on its operating results  and to reduce inventories 
these efforts are being taken to reduce the working capital investment required in the short term and improve profitability over the mid to long term 
the company s indefinite lived intangible assets totaled million as of july  the company assesses the fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model based on royalties estimated to be derived in the future use of the asset were the company to license the use of the trademark or trade name 
an impairment charge for indefinite lived intangible assets is recorded if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the estimated fair value on the measurement date 
the company completed its annual impairment test of indefinite lived intangible assets as of july  and concluded none of the assets were impaired 
the company considers qualitative and quantitative factors in determining whether impairment testing of the trademark and trade name assets is necessary at dates other than the annual impairment testing date  such as whether the company has plans to abandon or significantly reduce the use of a trademark or trade names 
based on consideration of these factors  the company determined that no impairment indicators have been present  and therefore  impairment testing as of a date other than july  is not required 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
the company cannot predict the occurrence of events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the company s customer base and net sales  a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers or sustained declines in the company s market capitalization relative to its reported stockholders equity 
the company periodically evaluates the impact of economic and other conditions on the company and its reporting units to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
capitalized software costs the company capitalizes costs associated with internal use software during the application development stage after both the preliminary project stage has been completed and the company s management has authorized and committed to funding for further project development 
capitalized internal use software costs include i external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software  ii payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time directly to the project  and iii interest costs incurred while developing the software 
capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose 
the company expenses as incurred research and development  general and administrative  and indirect costs associated with internal use software 
in addition  the company expenses as incurred training  maintenance and other internal use software costs incurred during the post implementation stage 
costs associated with upgrades and enhancements of internal use software are only capitalized if such modifications result in additional functionality of the software 
capitalized software costs were million at december  capitalized interest costs included in capitalized software were not material as of december  the company amortizes internal use software costs using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the software  which typically ranges from three to years 
capitalized software costs are evaluated annually for indicators of impairment including but not limited to a significant change in available technology or the manner in which the software is being used 
impaired items are written down to their estimated fair values 

table of contents other long lived assets the company continuously evaluates if impairment indicators related to its property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets are present 
these impairment indicators may include a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group 
if impairment indicators are present  the company estimates the future cash flows for the asset or group of assets 
the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the asset or group of assets is compared to their carrying amount 
the cash flows are estimated utilizing various assumptions regarding future revenue and expenses  working capital  and proceeds from asset disposals on a basis consistent with the company s strategic plan 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows  the company discounts the future cash flows using a discount rate required for a similar investment of like risk and records an impairment charge as the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset group 
generally  the company performs its testing of the asset group at the product line level  as this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 
product liability reserves the company has a self insurance program for product liability that includes reserves for self retained losses and certain excess and aggregate risk transfer insurance 
the company uses historical loss experience combined with actuarial evaluation methods  review of significant individual files and the application of risk transfer programs in determining required product liability reserves 
the company s actuarial evaluation methods take into account claims incurred but not reported when determining the company s product liability reserve 
the company has product liability reserves of million as of december  while the company believes that it has adequately reserved for these claims  the ultimate outcome of these matters may exceed the amounts recorded by the company  and such additional losses may be material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
legal and environmental reserves the company is subject to losses resulting from extensive and evolving federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations  as well as contract and other disputes 
the company evaluates the potential legal and environmental losses relating to each specific case and determines the probable loss based on historical experience and estimates of cash flows for certain environmental matters 
the estimated losses take into account anticipated costs associated with investigative and remediation efforts where an assessment has indicated that a probable liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
no insurance recovery is taken into account in determining the company s cost estimates or reserve  nor do the company s cost estimates or reserve reflect any discounting for present value purposes  except with respect to long term operations and maintenance comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability cercla matters which are estimated at present value 
the company s estimate of environmental response costs associated with these matters as of december  ranged between million and million 
as of december   the company had a reserve of million for such environmental response costs in the aggregate  which is included in other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
income taxes in accordance with relevant authoritative guidance  the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred income taxes are recognized based on the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as measured by current enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
no provision is made for the us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries as substantially all such earnings are permanently reinvested 
the company s income tax provisions are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the irs and other tax authorities 
although the company believes that the positions taken on previously filed tax returns are reasonable  it has established tax and interest reserves in recognition that various taxing authorities may challenge the positions taken  which could result in additional liabilities for taxes and interest 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
for uncertain tax positions  the company applies the provisions of relevant authoritative guidance  which requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of tax positions 
the company s ongoing assessments of the more likely than not outcomes of tax authority examinations and related tax positions require significant judgment and can increase or decrease the company s effective tax rate as well as impact operating results 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents pensions and other postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates and rate of compensation increases  as discussed below discount rates the company generally estimates the discount rate for its pension and other postretirement benefit obligations using an iterative process based on a hypothetical investment in a portfolio of high quality bonds that approximate the estimated cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the company believes this approach permits a matching of future cash outflows related to benefit payments with future cash inflows associated with bond coupons and maturities 
health care cost trend rate the company s health care cost trend rate is based on historical retiree cost data  near term health care outlook  and industry benchmarks and surveys 
expected return on plan assets the company s expected return on plan assets is derived from reviews of asset allocation strategies and historical and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes 
the company s analysis gives consideration to historical returns and long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality rates mortality rates are based on actual and projected plan experience 
rate of compensation increase the rate of compensation increases reflects the company s long term actual experience and its outlook  including consideration of expected rates of inflation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement plan obligations and future expense 
see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the assumptions used

the unrecognized gain loss for each plan is amortized to expense over the average life of each plan 
the net amount amortized to expense totaled million pre tax in  and amortization of unrecognized net losses is expected to continue to result in increases in pension and other postretirement plan expenses for the foreseeable future

as a result  changes in the us dollar value of the company s venezuelan bolivar net assets attributable to fluctuations in the parallel rate will be recorded as gains or losses in the statement of operations rather than in other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
fair value measurements fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
various valuation techniques exist for measuring fair value  including the market approach comparable market prices  the income approach present value of future income or cash flow  and the cost approach cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost 
these valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect the company s market assumptions 
the authoritative accounting guidance for fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes these two inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels 
the following is a brief description of those three levels level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability  including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for similar or identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable 
level unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions 
the company s assets and liabilities adjusted to fair value at least annually are its money market fund investments  included in cash and cash equivalents  mutual fund investments  included in other assets  and derivative instruments  primarily included in other assets  other accrued liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities  and these assets and liabilities are therefore subject to the measurement and disclosure requirements outlined in the authoritative guidance 
the company determines the fair value of its money market fund investments based on the values of the underlying assets level and its mutual fund investments based on quoted market prices level 
the company generally uses derivatives for hedging purposes  and the company s derivatives are primarily foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps 
the company determines the fair value of its derivative instruments based on level inputs in the fair value hierarchy 
level fair value determinations are derived from directly or indirectly observable market based information 
forward looking statements forward looking statements in this report are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements may relate to  but are not limited to  information or assumptions about the effects of sales including pricing  income loss  earnings per share  operating income or gross margin improvements or declines  project acceleration  capital and other expenditures  working capital  cash flow  dividends  capital structure  debt to capitalization ratios  availability of financing  interest rates  restructuring  impairment and other charges  potential losses on divestitures  impact of changes in accounting standards  pending legal proceedings and claims including environmental matters  future economic performance  costs and cost savings including raw material and sourced product inflation  productivity and streamlining  synergies  management s plans  goals and objectives for future operations  performance and growth or the assumptions relating to any of the forward looking statements 
these statements generally are accompanied by words such as intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  project  target  plan  expect  will  should  would or similar statements 
the company cautions that forward looking statements are not guarantees because there are inherent difficulties in predicting future results 
actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the company s dependence on the strength of retail  commercial and industrial sectors of the economy in light of the global economic slowdown  currency fluctuations  competition with other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products  major retailers strong bargaining power  changes in the prices of raw materials and sourced products and the company s ability to obtain raw materials and sourced products in a timely manner from suppliers  the company s ability to develop innovative new products and to develop  maintain and strengthen its end user brands  the company s ability to expeditiously close facilities and move operations while managing foreign regulations and other impediments  the company s ability to manage successfully risks associated with divesting or discontinuing businesses and product lines  the company s ability to implement successfully information technology solutions throughout its organization  the company s ability to improve productivity and streamline operations  the company s ability to refinance short term debt on terms acceptable to it  particularly given the uncertainties in the global credit markets  changes to the company s credit ratings  significant increases in the funding obligations related to the company s pension plans due to declining asset values or otherwise  the imposition of tax liabilities greater than the company s provisions for such matters  significant increases in costs to comply with changes in legal  employment  tax  environmental and other laws and regulations  the risks inherent in the company s foreign operations and those matters set forth in this report generally and item a to this report

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s market risk is impacted by changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
pursuant to the company s policies  natural hedging techniques and derivative financial instruments may be utilized to reduce the impact of adverse changes in rates and prices 
the company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floating rate debt 
the company manages its interest rate exposure through its mix of fixed and floating rate debt and its conservative debt ratio target 
interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges are used to mitigate the company s exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt resulting from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates 
accordingly  benchmark interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  which are offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the swap agreements 
interest rate swaps may also be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate based on market conditions  and for qualifying hedges  the interest differential of swaps is included in interest expense 
excluding debt for which a fixed rate has been swapped for a floating rate  fixed rate debt represented approximately of the company s billion of total debt as of december  foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business since a portion of the company s sales  expenses and operating transactions is conducted on a global basis in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that business transactions are not denominated in the functional currency of the entity entering into the transaction  the company is exposed to transactional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the company s foreign exchange risk management policy emphasizes hedging anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transaction exposures of one year duration or less 
the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts as economic hedges for commercial transactions and to offset the future impact of gains and losses resulting from changes in the expected amount of functional currency cash flows to be received or paid upon settlement of the anticipated intercompany and third party commercial transactions 
gains and losses related to the settlement of qualifying hedges of commercial and intercompany transactions are deferred and included in the basis of the underlying transactions 
the company also uses natural hedging techniques such as offsetting or netting like foreign currency flows and denominating contracts in the appropriate functional currency 
the company also incurs gains and losses recorded within shareholders equity due to the translation of the financial statements from the functional currency of its subsidiaries to us dollars 
the company utilizes capital structures of foreign subsidiaries combined with forward contracts to minimize its exposure to foreign currency risk 
the company may hedge portions of its net investments in foreign subsidiaries  including intercompany loans  with forward contracts and cross currency hedges 
gains and losses related to qualifying forward exchange contracts and cross currency hedges  which are generally used to hedge intercompany loans and net investments in foreign subsidiaries  are recognized in other comprehensive income loss 
commodity prices the company purchases certain raw materials  including resin  corrugate  steel  stainless steel  aluminum and other metals  which are subject to price volatility caused by unpredictable factors 
the company s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene and polypropylene in roughly equal quantities 
while future movements of raw material costs are uncertain  a variety of programs  including periodic raw material purchases  purchases of raw materials for future delivery and customer price adjustments help the company address this risk 
where practical  the company uses derivatives as part of its risk management process 
financial instruments in managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations  the company uses interest rate swaps  foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps 
derivatives were recorded at fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  as follows in millions prepaid expenses and other other assets other accrued liabilities other noncurrent liabilities see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 

table of contents value at risk the amounts shown below represent the estimated potential economic loss that the company could incur from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign exchange rates using the value at risk estimation model 
the value at risk model uses historical foreign exchange rates and interest rates to estimate the volatility and correlation of these rates in future periods 
it estimates a loss in fair market value using statistical modeling techniques that are based on a variance covariance approach and includes substantially all market risk exposures specifically excluding equity method investments 
the fair value losses shown in the table below represent the company s estimate of the maximum loss that could arise in one day 
the amounts presented in the table are shown as an illustration of the impact of potential adverse changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
the following table sets forth the one day value at risk as of and for the year ended december  in millions  except percentages market risk average december  average december  confidence level interest rates foreign exchange the company generally does not enter into material derivative contracts for commodities  therefore  commodity price risk is not shown because the amounts are not material 
the year over year decrease in the end of year value at risk in foreign exchange is primarily due to reduced volatility in foreign exchange rates in late as well as declines in overall currency exposures 
the confidence interval signifies the company s degree of confidence that actual losses would not exceed the estimated losses shown above 
the amounts shown here disregard the possibility that interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could move in the company s favor 
the value at risk model assumes that all movements in these rates will be adverse 
actual experience has shown that gains and losses tend to offset each other over time  and it is highly unlikely that the company could experience losses such as these over an extended period of time 
additionally  since the company operates globally  and therefore  among a broad basket of currencies  its foreign currency exposure is diversified 
these amounts should not be considered projections of future losses  because actual results may differ significantly depending upon activity in the global financial markets
