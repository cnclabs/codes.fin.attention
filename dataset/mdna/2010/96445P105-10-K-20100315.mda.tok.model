item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this section is intended to provide an understanding of the financial performance of white river through a discussion of the factors affecting white river s financial condition at december  and  and white river s consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and this section should be read in conjunction with white river s consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements that appear elsewhere in this document 
in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
see discussion of forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
white river believes that the following represents the material critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ significantly from estimates 
allowance for loan losses finance receivables provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to cover probable credit losses inherent in finance receivables 
the allowance for loan losses is established systematically by management based on the determination of the amount of probable credit losses inherent in the finance receivables as of the reporting date 
coastal credit reviews charge off experience factors  delinquency reports  historical collection rates and other information in order to make the necessary judgments as to credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the reporting date 
assumptions regarding probable credit losses are reviewed quarterly and may be impacted by actual performance of finance receivables and changes in any of the factors discussed above 
should the credit loss assumptions increase  there could be an increase in the amount of allowance for loan losses required  which could decrease the net carrying value of finance receivables and increase the provision for loan losses recorded on the consolidated statements of operations 
coastal credit believes that the existing allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable finance receivable losses 
goodwill goodwill was not amortized  rather  white river annually tested goodwill for impairment 
the amount of goodwill impairment was measured as the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implicit fair value  based on the fair value of the reporting unit 
goodwill was written off during the year ended december  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax asset depends on white river s ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the future and its ability to avoid an ownership change for tax purposes 
the valuation allowance has been derived pursuant to the provisions of asc topic no 
 income taxes  and reduces the total deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   there was no liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asc topic no 
 subsequent events asc 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
specifically  asc provides clarity around the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements  and the disclosure that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
asc is effective for interim and annual financial reporting periods ending after june  and shall be applied prospectively 
this guidance was subsequently amended on february  to no longer require disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events 
the effect of adoption was not material 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic no 
 consolidation asc 
asc requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest s give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie 
in addition  asc requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  which was previously only required upon the occurrence of specified events  and requires additional disclosures concerning an enterprise s continuing involvement with variable interest entities 
asc is effective for annual periods beginning after november   which is january  for white river  and interim periods within that annual reporting period 
white river is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of adopting asc on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic no 
 generally accepted accounting positions asc the codification 
the codification is now the source of authoritative us gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities 
rules and interpretive releases of the united states securities and exchange commissions sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
on the effective date  the codification superseded all then existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
all other non grandfathered non sec accounting literature not included in the codification became non authoritative 
the codification is effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  the adoption of the codification did not result in a change in white river s current practices and had no impact on its consolidated financial statements as of december  results of operations the year ended december  compared to the year ended december net income was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   compared to net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  the increase in net income from the prior year is primarily due to a million impairment of goodwill recognized during with no such charge during this increase in net income was partially offset by the following a decrease in accretion income from accumulated other comprehensive income during  and an increase in provision for estimated credit losses during of million 
discussion of results the following table presents consolidating financial information for white river for the periods indicated for the year ended december  uac coastal credit corporate and other consolidated total interest income interest expense net interest margin recovery provision for estimated credit losses net interest margin after recovery provision for estimated credit losses total other expenses income loss before income taxes for the year ended december  uac coastal credit corporate and other consolidated total interest income interest expense net interest margin recovery provision for estimated credit losses net interest margin after recovery provision for estimated credit losses total other revenues expenses goodwill impairment income loss before income taxes the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated interest on receivables was million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coastal credit interest on receivables increased million 
this increase is a result of an increase in the coastal credit average finance receivable balance to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  interest on receivables from uac declined million due to a decline in the average receivable balance to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  as a result of the liquidation of finance receivables 
uac interest income will continue to decline in future periods as the finance receivable portfolio continues to liquidate 
accretion and other interest decreased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease is a result of a decrease in accretion from accumulated other comprehensive income 
the balance of accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately  will be fully accreted into income in the individual components of accretion and other interest income are shown in the following table in thousands years ended december  uac discount accretion from accumulated other comprehensive income interest on cash balances accretion and other interest income interest expense decreased to million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coastal credit interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the decrease in interest rates during and the decrease in average line of credit to million from million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
uac interest expense was relatively unchanged at million 
provision for estimated credit losses was million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
provision for estimated credit losses is charged to income to bring coastal credit s allowance for estimated credit losses to a level which management considers adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio of finance receivables 
for coastal credit  the provision for estimated credit losses was million for the years ended december  and uac recorded recovery for estimated credit losses of million compared to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this change in recovery for estimated credit losses is a result of declining defaulted receivables during and salaries and benefits decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of performance based awards paid during the second quarter of of approximately million but not in as well as a decrease in stock based compensation as a result of awards fully vesting during other operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  coastal credit operating expenses remained relatively unchanged between these periods 
corporate and other operating expenses decreased million between these periods 
this decrease was primarily a result of non employee performance based awards paid during but not in this decrease was partially offset by the severance payment related to the departure of an executive officer of white river on august  and the expense of approximately  of equity related costs associated with the previously disclosed merger transaction with first chicago bancorp which was terminated on june  
the equity related costs had been recognized as prepaid expenses prior to being expensed 
white river conducted its annual test for impairment of goodwill as of august  the annual impairment test of goodwill resulted in the full impairment of goodwill totaling million 
the methodology for determining the fair value of the reporting unit was a combination of quoted market prices  prices of comparable businesses  discounted estimated cash flows and other valuation techniques 
the significant downturn in the equity markets during the third quarter exacerbated the decreased valuations calculated using these methodologies 
third party servicing expenses decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  uac is the only segment that incurred this expense 
this decrease is the result of the ongoing liquidation of the uac receivable portfolio during uac pays a monthly servicing fee per active receivable 
as the number of receivables decreased as the result of the liquidation of receivables  the third party servicing expenses decreased 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the expense is based on the estimated effective tax rates for and  respectively 
the benefit for the year ended december  was primarily a result of the million tax effect from the impairment of goodwill 
financial condition as of december  and finance receivables  net finance receivables  net increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  uac finance receivables  net decreased to approximately  at december  as compared to million at december  coastal credit finance receivables  net increased to million compared to million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
a significant number of contracts acquired by coastal credit are contracts made with borrowers who are in the united states military 
as of december   of the coastal credit receivables were with borrowers who are in the united states military as compared to as of december  coastal credit believes that having in the portfolio a significant percentage of contracts for which the borrowers are united states military personnel contributes to lower payment delinquency and greater collection personnel efficiencies 
coastal credit requests that all borrowers who are in the military use the military allotment system to make payments on their contracts 
under this allotment system  the borrower authorizes the military to make a payroll deduction for the amount of the borrower s monthly contract payment and to direct this deduction payment to coastal credit on behalf of the borrower 
delinquency of payments on contracts paid by allotment historically has been less than delinquency of payments on contracts not paid by allotment 
as a result  the collection effort associated with the military contracts requires substantially less time  allowing coastal credit s collection staff to focus on non military contracts 
accrued interest payable accrued interest payable was million at december   compared to million at december  the change in accrued interest payable is the result of the decline in the interest rate on the line of credit 
creditor notes payable creditor notes payable was approximately  at december   compared to million at december  the decrease was the result of fair market valuation adjustments to uac s third party creditor notes payable during as well as distributions paid 
liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change in net cash flows provided by operating activities is primarily a result of the reduction of interest expense from coastal credit related to the decrease in interest rates and the reduction in the average line of credit between the period and a reduction of total other expenses of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this change was primarily the result of the continued reduction in the principal collection and recoveries on the uac finance receivable portfolio and the increase in purchases of finance receivables by coastal credit during compared to net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily resulted from the million repurchase of white river common stock and million quarterly dividend that was paid on december  net cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended december  primarily resulted from the million net repayment of the line of credit 
at december   white river and its subsidiaries had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december coastal credit has a revolving credit facility from a lending institution with a maximum borrowing limit at december  of million 
the maturity date on the line of credit is december  and the interest rate is the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
as of december   coastal credit had million of indebtedness outstanding under this facility as compared to million as of december  total availability under the line of credit at december  was million based upon the level of eligible collateral  with million and million available in excess of the amount utilized at december  and  respectively 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of coastal credit 
in addition  white river has provided an unconditional corporate guaranty 
coastal credit must maintain specified financial ratios within guidelines established by the lender 
interest is paid monthly at a variable rate  based on meeting certain financial criteria 
the average rate during the month of december  and was libor plus which equated to and  respectively 
there is an annual commitment fee of of on the average daily unused commitment 
in the event of a significant pay down or an earlier retirement of the revolver commitment  coastal credit would sustain certain prepayment penalties 
this facility limits distributions coastal credit may make to white river to of coastal credit s net income 
uac s sources of liquidity are limited and consist of cash on hand  funds from consolidated operations and cash collections from the liquidating finance receivables 
white river  as owner of the substantial majority of uac s notes and claims outstanding under the plan of reorganization  is entitled to distribution of the substantial majority of these cash flows as they are realized by uac 
however  the realization of such projected cash flows is dependent upon the performance of the underlying auto receivable portfolios and the effective servicing of such receivables 
in particular  if gross defaults  recoveries on defaulted receivables or prepayments on such receivables are less favorable than the rates projected by management  uac s realization of such cash flows will be reduced or delayed relative to such projections 
white river s sources of liquidity  as the parent company  are limited and consist of cash on hand  payments by uac on the uac creditor notes payable owned by white river and distributions by coastal credit subject to restrictions under coastal credit s credit facility 
on november   the board of directors reauthorized white river s previously announced share repurchase program 
white river is now authorized to repurchase up to  shares of its outstanding common stock  from time to time and subject to market conditions  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   white river has repurchased  shares of its outstanding common stock under the program for million 
on november   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share on its common stock to shareholders of record on november  this quarterly dividend totaling million was paid on december  on february   white river announced that its board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share on its common stock to shareholders of record on march  this quarterly dividend was paid on march  asset quality set forth below is certain information concerning the credit loss experiences on the fixed rate retail automobile receivables of white river 
there can be no assurance that future net credit loss experience on the receivables will be comparable to that set forth below

finance receivables coastal credit delinquency experience of finance receivables at coastal credit  including unearned interest in thousands december  finance receivables gross balance delinquencies days days days total delinquencies as a result of the nature of the customers in coastal credit s portfolio  coastal credit considers the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses to be critical to its financial results 
coastal credit has an allowance for loan losses that is calculated independent of the aggregate acquisition discounts and fees on finance receivables 
coastal credit s allowance for loan losses is based upon the historical rate at which current loans  contracts in a  and day delinquency state and loans ineligible for its borrowing line  have defaulted 
these historical rates are evaluated and revised on a quarterly basis for current conditions

in addition  there have been auto finance companies which have seen their lines of credit reduced or terminated as a result of the credit crisis 
some companies have been forced to severely curtail loan purchases and originations or shut down operations as a result of a lack of funding 
we believe white river is well positioned to continue operations and grow the company responsibly based on the following factors coastal credit is not dependent on the securitization market for financing 
at december   there was million available  in excess of the amount utilized  from the line of credit  which does not expire until december white river is very well capitalized with an equity to asset ratio of as of december  while there is never any guarantee white river will not be faced with similar financing scenarios as others have seen  we believe white river is well positioned in this difficult economic environment  and we expect to be able to fund normal business operations and meet our general liquidity needs for the next months through access to the line of credit  cash flows from operations  and our other funding sources
