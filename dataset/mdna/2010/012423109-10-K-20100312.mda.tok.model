overview we provide scientific services  products and technologies focused on improving the quality of life while delivering excellence  value and maximum return to our shareholders 
our core business consists of contract drug discovery  development and manufacturing services 
in addition to our contract services  we also have a separate  strategic technology division consisting of proprietary technology investments  internal drug discovery and niche generic active pharmaceutical ingredient product development 
we conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds to third parties in return for up front and service fees  and milestone payments as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
our proprietary research and development activities previously led us to license the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize potential products from the amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor patents and technology identified in one of our proprietary research programs to bristol myers squibb company bms  in october in addition  these activities also led to the development  patenting and licensing of a substantially pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  the active ingredient in the non sedating antihistamine fexofenadine hcl marketed by sanofi aventis sa as allegra in the americas and as telfast elsewhere 
our total revenue for was million  including million from our contract service business  million from milestones and million from royalties on sales of allegra telfast 
we generated million in cash from operations and used million in capital expenditures on our facilities and equipment  primarily related to the expansion and relocation of our facilities in bothell  washington and budapest  hungary 
we recorded a net loss of million in  primarily as a result of a million goodwill impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments and million in bank and other related debt 
strategy we provide contract services to the world s leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we derive our contract revenue from research and development expenditures and commercial manufacturing demands of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry 
we continue to execute our long term strategy to develop and grow an integrated global platform from which we can provide these services 
we have research and manufacturing facilities in the united states  hungary  singapore and india 
in  we purchased an additional large scale manufacturing site in india and completed a  square foot expansion of our singapore research center 
in  we completed the expansion of our bothell  washington and budapest  hungary facilities 
most recently  in february  we acquired excelsyn ltd  a well recognized leader in providing chemical development and manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical industry in europe 
we continue to integrate our research and manufacturing facilities worldwide  increasing our access to key global markets and enabling us to provide our customers with a flexible combination of high quality services and competitive cost structures to meet their individual outsourcing needs 
we seek comprehensive research and or supply agreements with our customers  incorporating several of our service offerings and spanning across the entire pharmaceutical research and development process 
our research facilities provide discovery  chemical development  analytical  and small scale current good manufacturing practices cgmp manufacturing services 
compounds discovered and or developed in our research facilities can then be more easily transitioned to production at our large scale manufacturing facilities for use in clinical trials and  ultimately  commercial sales if the product meets regulatory approval 
we believe that the ability to partner with a single provider of pharmaceutical research and development services from discovery through commercial production is of significant benefit to our customers 
through our comprehensive service offerings  we are able to provide customers with a more efficient transition of experimental compounds through the research and development process  ultimately reducing the time and cost involved in bringing these compounds from concept to market 
our global platform has increased our market penetration and was developed in order to allow us to maintain and grow margins 
in addition to our globalization  we continue to implement process efficiencies  including our continued efforts of process improvement and cost savings measures  along with efforts to strengthen our sourcing 
we believe these factors will lead to improved margins 
we conduct proprietary research and development to discover new therapeutically active lead compounds with commercial potential 
we anticipate that we would then license these compounds and underlying technology to third parties in return for up front and service fees and milestone payments  as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are developed into new commercial drugs 
research and development is performed at our large scale manufacturing facility related to the potential manufacture of new products  the development of processes for the manufacture of generic products with commercial potential  and the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
beginning in and continuing through  we experienced increased demand in the areas of developmental and small scale cgmp manufacturing services  reflecting a reduction in budgetary constraints of our emerging pharmaceutical and biotech customers and their increased efforts to bring identified compounds into clinical trials 
during this timeframe  partly in recognition of increased competition and consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry  we established lower cost international operations in hungary  singapore and india 
contract service providers that were not able to offer a cost competitive product were forced to exit or significantly reduce their presence in the marketplace during this time 
in addition to providing customers with a range of technologies and cost options  expanding internationally has provided increased access to customers and potential customers in regions of the world which we had not significantly pursued 
in addition to this growth in development and small scale cgmp manufacturing services  we had also seen an increased trend in demand for our discovery service as we increased our ability to provide high quality services under a variety of business models and cost structures by incorporating our international facilities 
in  we experienced a decrease in customer delivery patterns and demand caused by the economic downturn 
as the industry emerges from this economic downturn  we are cautiously optimistic that demand for our discovery and development services should return 
we continue to build on our strategy of leveraging our global resources to meet changing and expanding global outsourcing needs and additionally to expand our global service platform to meet the needs of our customers 
in  we completed the construction of a  square foot research center focusing primarily on custom synthesis and medicinal chemistry support services at the shapoorji pallonji biotech park in hyderabad  india 
additionally  we have recently planned a  square foot expansion of this facility 
our expansion of our singapore research center not only increased existing discovery service capabilities  but also included the introduction of in vitro biology services at the facility 
we also completed the expansion of our research facilities in budapest  hungary and bothell  washington during we have integrated our drug discovery and development research facilities with our large scale manufacturing facilities to allow for the easier transition throughout the entire pharmaceutical research and development process 
through our comprehensive service offerings  we are able to provide customers with a more efficient transition of compounds through the research and development process  ultimately reducing the time and cost involved in bringing these compounds from concept to market 
we enhanced our large scale manufacturing capabilities with our acquisitions of manufacturing facilities in india in and in  we completed the modernization and expansion of our pilot plant facilities in india 
additionally  in february  we acquired excelsyn ltd  which will provide us with additional development and large scale manufacturing services in europe 
with these acquisitions and expansion  we have globalized our manufacturing operations  which offers us the flexibility to produce raw materials and process intermediates to support our domestic large scale manufacturing facility 
in addition  we believe that these acquisitions improve our generic drug product manufacturing capabilities and provide the opportunity to increase our global manufacturing market penetration over time 
results of operations operating segment data we have organized our sales  marketing and production activities into the discovery development small scale manufacturing dds and large scale manufacturing lsm segments based on the criteria set forth in asc  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we rely on an internal management accounting system to report results of these segments 
the accounting system includes revenue and cost information by segment 
we make financial decisions and allocate resources based on the information we receive from this internal system 
the dds segment includes activities such as drug lead discovery  optimization  drug development and small scale commercial manufacturing 
the lsm segment includes pilot to commercial scale manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates and high potency and controlled substance manufacturing 
api manufacturing is performed at our rensselaer facility and is in compliance with cgmp 
contract revenue contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
our contract revenues for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in thousands dds lsm total dds contract revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million as compared to the same period in this result is primarily due to a decrease in contract revenue from development and small scale manufacturing services of million caused by lower demand from specialty pharma biotech customers and more competitive pricing in the overall current economic downturn 
in addition  discovery services contract revenue decreased million due primarily to the completion of revenue recognition in october related to the licensing and funded research component of our on going collaboration with bms and the completion of recognition of access fees related to the preliminary screening phase of an on going natural products collaboration 
the decrease was also due to lower customer demand for services performed at our international locations  offset in part by an increase in us medicinal chemistry demand 
we currently expect dds contract revenue for full year to increase over amounts recognized in primarily due to increases in demand for our international based services  particularly in the area of integrated drug programs  as well as our global hybrid offering 
lsm revenue for the year ended december  decreased to million from the same period in primarily due to decreases in demand from ge healthcare and timing of customer requirements of million  a decrease of million related to reduced demand for clinical supply materials  as well as production interruptions at our international facility 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in commercial sales of million  resulting from an increase in demand for existing commercial products  along with shipments of an additional commercial product in we currently expect lsm contract revenue for full year to increase over amounts recognized in primarily due to returning demand by our largest customer to pre levels  as well as increased demand for our pilot plant facility in india 
dds contract revenue for the year ended december  increased million or compared to contract revenue for the same period in this was primarily due to an increase in discovery services revenue of million due to increased demand for these services  as our ability to offer various combinations of services and cost structures at our us and international locations continued to gain acceptance in the worldwide marketplace 
an additional million increase was due to the completion of the preliminary screening phase of an on going natural products collaboration project at our bothell research facility 
the year over year increase was also due to increased contract revenue from development and small scale manufacturing services of million  as customers continued to focus on development stage projects 
lsm contract revenue increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase in contract revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in incremental revenues from our june amri india acquisition 
additionally  sales to ge healthcare increased million due to the timing of customer requirements and related deliveries  along with an increase in revenue from the production of clinical supply materials for use in advanced stage human trials of commercial product of million 
recurring royalties we earn royalties under our licensing agreement with sanofi aventis sa for the active ingredient in allegra 
royalties were as follows year ended december  in thousands recurring royalties  which are based on the worldwide sales of allegra telfast  as well as on sales of sanofi aventis authorized generics  increased million for the year ended december  from the same period in primarily due to an increase in international sales of allegra by sanofi aventis as well as the addition of royalties on the sale of authorized generics by teva  an increased royalty rate on one allegra product and the recognition of sublicensing fees received under the amended agreement with sanofi aventis 
recurring royalties increased million for the year ended december  from the same period in the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues  earnings and operating cash flows 
as provided in the settlement  teva pharmaceuticals launched a generic version of allegra d in november we will receive quarterly royalties through july for the branded allegra d equal to the royalties paid for the quarter ended june  thereafter  the royalty rate will revert to the rate in effect prior to the signing of the sub license amendment and we will also receive a royalty on teva pharmaceuticals sales of generic allegra d 
we currently expect royalty revenues for to decrease from amounts recognized in the decrease is driven by the generic launch of allegra d  which will begin to impact royalties in the second half of  along with the potential transition from generics to the otc market within the us market by sanofi aventis through their acquisition of chattem  inc although this switch could be positive in the longer term  it could potentially have a negative impact on our royalties in the short term 
we continue to develop our business in an effort to supplement the revenues  earnings and operating cash flows that have historically been provided by allegra telfast royalties 
we forcefully and vigorously defend our intellectual property related to allegra  and we continue to pursue our intellectual property rights as patent infringement litigation progresses 
milestone revenue milestone revenue is earned for achieving certain milestones included in licensing and research agreements with certain customers 
milestone revenues were as follows year ended december  in thousands during the year ended december   milestone revenue of million was recognized in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms 
million was recognized as a result of the submission of a clinical trial application and an additional million was recognized for advancing a third compound into preclinical development 
during the year ended december   the company recognized million of milestone revenue in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms 
a million milestone payment was triggered by bms s submission of an application to the health products and food branch hpfb  health canada to initiate phase clinical studies on a compound 
an additional million was recognized for advancing a second compound into preclinical development under the same agreement with bms 
milestone revenue received during the year ended december  was primarily due to a milestone payment of million in conjunction with the company s license and research agreement with bms 
this milestone payment was triggered by a compound being developed under the agreement proceeding into preclinical development 
an additional million of milestone revenue was recognized during the fourth quarter of from a collaborative research agreement 
cost of contract revenue cost of contract revenue consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees  as well as chemicals  depreciation and other indirect project related costs 
cost of contract revenue for our dds and lsm segments were as follows year ended december  in thousands dds lsm total dds gross margin lsm gross margin total gross margin dds had contract revenue gross margin of for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in this decrease resulted from lower demand for these services in relation to our fixed costs  as well as the completion of the recognition of revenue and access fees associated with the preliminary screening phase of an on going natural products collaboration project at our bothell research facility and the completion of the recognition of revenue from the licensing and funded research components of our on going collaboration with bms 
additionally  this decrease was further caused by soft customer demand at our european and asian locations 
we currently expect dds contract margins for to moderately improve from amounts recognized in lsm s contract revenue gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to decreased plant utilization as a result of order reductions by our largest customer in  as well as delays in nda submissions and approvals for customer materials that were queued up for production 
additionally  the decrease was further related to non cash inventory write downs primarily related to slower moving quantities of a legacy generic product of million 
we currently expect lsm contract margins for to moderately improve from amounts recognized in dds contract revenue gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to in the increase in gross margin resulted from increased contract revenues in relation to the fixed cost components of dds contract business 
lsm contract revenue gross margin increased to for the year ended december  compared to in the increase was primarily due to process efficiencies  as well as an increase in sales volume from our largest customer  ge healthcare 
these increases were partially offset  by a decrease in margin resulting from start up costs associated with our acquisitions of amri india and finekem  along with price concessions on sales to ge healthcare in although these price concessions decreased our gross margin  we believed this would strengthen our ability to retain this customer beyond the contract period ending in this result was achieved in january when ge healthcare extended its supply agreement with us through technology incentive award we maintain a technology development incentive plan  the purpose of which is to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology developments by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor or made a significant intellectual contribution 
to date  the royalties from allegra are the main driver of the awards 
accordingly  as the creator of the technology  the award is currently payable primarily to dr 
thomas d ambra  our chief executive officer and president of the company 
the incentive awards were as follows year ended december  in thousands we expect technology incentive award expense to generally fluctuate directionally and proportionately with fluctuations in allegra royalties in future periods 
the increase in technology incentive award expense for the year ended december  as compared to was due to the increase in allegra royalty revenue and an increase in awards granted in relation to milestone payments 
research and development research and development r d expense consists of compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary technology r d projects  costs of chemicals and other out of pocket costs  and overhead costs 
we utilize our expertise in small molecule chemistry  biocatalysis and natural product technologies to perform our internal r d projects 
the goal of these programs is to discover new compounds with commercial potential 
we would then seek to license these compounds to a third party in return for a combination of up front license fees  milestone payments and recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
in addition  r d is performed at our large scale manufacturing facility related to the potential manufacture of new products  the development of processes for the manufacture of generic products with commercial potential  and the development of alternative manufacturing processes 
r d expenses were as follows year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from the same period in the increase in r d expense during the year ended december  was due primarily to improving the manufacturing process for our generic api products and by the continued establishment of r d activities at our singapore facility  including in vitro biology research capabilities 
the increase was further due to the advancement of our oncology compound through phase i clinical trials and the transition of research staff to our mch obesity research program upon completion of the funded component of the collaboration with bms 
we currently expect r d expense to remain flat in from amounts recognized in  as we manage overall r d expenditures to move our most advanced programs forward 
projecting completion dates and anticipated revenue from our internal research programs is not practical at this time due to the early stages of the projects and the inherent risks related to the development of new drugs 
our proprietary amine neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor program  which was our most advanced project at that time  was licensed to bms in october in exchange for up front license fees  contracted research services  and the rights to future milestone and royalty payments 
we also continue to utilize our proprietary technologies to further advance other early to middle stage internal research programs in the fields of oncology  irritable bowel syndrome  obesity  and cns  with a view to seeking a licensing partner for these programs at an appropriate research or developmental stage 
we budget and monitor our r d expenses by type or category  rather than by project on a comprehensive or fully allocated basis 
in addition  our r d expenses are not tracked by project as they often benefit multiple projects in our technology platform 
consequently  fully loaded r d expense summaries by project are not available 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this increase was due primarily to the increase in third party costs associated with our oncology research program and to the establishment of r d activities at our singapore facility  offset in part by a decrease in salaries and benefits caused by the increased utilization of staff on external customer projects 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing  operational and administrative employees  professional service fees  marketing costs and costs related to facilities and information services 
sg a expenses were as follows year ended december  in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in these decreases are primarily attributable to overall cost savings measures in  including incremental cost savings from our restructuring of our hungary operations and additionally from a reorganization of our large scale india operations 
sg a expenses are expected to remain flat or slightly increase in from amounts recognized in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  was primarily attributable to incremental administrative costs at our amri india location  which was acquired in june  along with an increase in bad debt expense and increases in salaries and benefits and relocation expenses related to an increase in business development  administrative and information technology personnel 
restructuring charges amri india in december  we initiated a restructuring of our amri india location which consisted of closing and consolidating its mumbai administrative office into its hyderabad location as part of our goal to streamline operations and eliminate duplicate administrative functions 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  including lease termination charges of million  leasehold improvement abandonment charges of million and administrative costs of less than million 
the restructuring costs are included under the caption restructuring charge in the consolidated financial statement of operations during and the restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the amri india restructuring activity was recorded in our large scale manufacturing lsm operating segment 
the following table displays amri india s restructuring activity and liability balances within our lsm operating segment balance at january  charges paid amounts foreign currency translation adjustments balance at december  lease termination charges leasehold improvement abandonment charges administrative costs associated with restructuring total lease termination charges and leasehold improvement abandonment charges relate to costs associated with exiting the current facility 
the net cash outflow related to the amri india restructuring for the year ended december  was less than million 
anticipated cash outflows related to the amri india restructuring for is approximately million  which primarily consists of lease termination charges 
amri hungary in may  we initiated a restructuring of our hungary location 
the goal of the restructuring was to realign the business model for these operations to better support our long term strategy for providing discovery services in the european marketplace 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately in the second quarter of  including termination benefits and personnel realignment costs of approximately million  losses on grant contracts of approximately million  lease termination charges of approximately million and administrative costs associated with the restructuring plan of million 
during august  we closed and consolidated our balaton  hungary facility into the new facility in budapest  hungary as part of our goal to streamline operations and to consolidate locations  equipment and operating costs 
as a result of this restructuring  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million in the second quarter of  including termination benefits and personnel realignment costs of approximately million  lease termination charges of million and administrative costs associated with the restructuring plan of less than million 
the restructuring costs are included under the caption restructuring charge in the consolidated financial statement of operations during the years ended december  and and the restructuring liabilities are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets at december  and the hungary restructuring activity was recorded in the dds operating segment 
the following table displays amri hungary s restructuring activity and liability balances within our dds operating segment balance at january  charges paid amounts reversals foreign currency translation adjustments balance at december  termination benefits and personnel realignment losses on grant contracts lease termination charges administrative costs associated with restructuring total termination benefits and personnel realignment costs relate to severance packages  outplacement services  and career counseling for employees affected by this restructuring 
losses on grant contracts represent estimated contractual losses that will be incurred in performing grant based work under hungary s legacy business model 
lease termination charges relate to costs associated with exiting the current facility 
the reversals in were primarily due to actual termination benefit and personnel realignment costs being lower than initially anticipated at the time of the restructuring 
the net cash outflow related to the hungary restructuring for the year ended december  was million 
anticipated cash outflow related to the hungary restructuring for is approximately million  which primarily consists of lease termination charges and incurring losses on grant contracts 
goodwill impairment year ended december  in thousands we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in our lsm operating segment due to a change in the implied fair value of the segment s goodwill to below its carrying value during the fourth quarter of the change in the fair value of the segment was primarily attributable to the fact that in the fourth quarter of several issues occurred in the lsm segment that significantly impacted our expected future performance 
two phase iii products that were expected to receive fda approval were delayed  one by the fda requiring more information and one by the customer in an effort to proactively collect more data before submitting to the fda 
it was expected throughout that commercial manufacturing would commence on both these products at the rensselaer lsm facility beginning in this has now been delayed to and beyond 
in addition  the company was notified of additional unexpected reductions in demand for product under the commercial supply agreement with its largest customer  ge healthcare 
these additional unplanned demand reductions in q add an element of risk related to the company s ability to achieve the significant revenues expected from this contract that are reflected in the future projections for the segment 
interest income  net year ended december  in thousands interest expense interest income interest income  net interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in due to the decrease of interest rates on our outstanding debt 
interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates in interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared with the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates earned on interest bearing investments during  along with decreases in the average balances of interest bearing cash and investments held during the year 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to decreases in the average balances of interest bearing cash and investments held by the company as well as decreases in the interest rates earned on these balances in other expense income  net year ended december  in thousands other expense for the year ended december  was million as compares to other income of million for the same period in this difference is primarily due to a net loss in associated with our foreign currency transactions as compared to a net gain in additionally  in  we recorded greater losses on disposal of fixed assets as compared with income tax benefit expense year ended december  in thousands income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million as compared to income tax expense of million for the same period in the company s effective tax rate of of pre tax loss for the year ended december  differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the establishment of valuation reserves on certain net operating loss carry forwards 
the company s effective tax rate of of pre tax income for the year ended december  differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to the recapture of tax credits derived from certain of the company s r d expenses and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions  which were resolved in we currently expect our effective tax rate for to be of pre tax income 
income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the company s effective tax rate decreased to of pre tax income for the year ended december  from of pre tax income for the year ended december  the increase in income tax expense was due primarily to an increase in pre tax income of million and changes in the composition of taxable income in relation to the applicable tax rates at our various international locations in these increases were partially offset by the recapture of tax credits derived from certain of the company s r d expenses and the reversal of reserves for an uncertain tax position  which were resolved in liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows and proceeds from borrowings 
during  we generated cash of million from operating activities 
the sources of operating cash flows were primarily from the receipt of a million in for a sub licensing fee from sanofi aventis in conjunction with the amended licensing agreement entered into in the fourth quarter of  a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of cash collections and allegra royalties 
the recurring royalties we receive on the sales of allegra telfast have historically provided a material portion of our revenues and operating cash flows 
as discussed in item of this form k  several generic manufacturers had filed anda applications with the fda seeking authorization to produce and market a generic version of allegra 
we and aventis pharmaceuticals have filed several patent infringement suits against these generic companies alleging infringement of certain us patents 
on november   the company  its former subsidiary amr technology  aventis pharmaceuticals  sanofi aventis  teva pharmaceuticals  and barr laboratories reached a settlement regarding the above described patent infringement litigations relating to teva pharmaceuticals and barr laboratories 
as part of the settlement  the company entered into an amendment to its licensing agreement with sanofi aventis to allow sanofi aventis to sublicense patents related to allegra and allegra d to teva pharmaceuticals and barr laboratories in the united states 
subsequently  teva pharmaceutical acquired barr laboratories 
the company received an upfront sublicense fee from sanofi aventis of million  and sanofi aventis will pay royalties to the company on the sale of products in the united states containing fexofenadine hydrochloride the generic name for the active ingredient in allegra and products containing fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride generic allegra d by teva pharmaceuticals through  along with additional consideration 
although the launch of a generic version of allegra d occurred in november  we will receive quarterly royalties through july equal to the royalties paid for the quarter ended june  thereafter  the royalty rate will revert to the rate in effect prior to the signing of the sub license amendment 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities  primarily consisting of million for the acquisition of property and equipment and million for net purchases of investment securities 
during  we generated million for financing activities  consisting primarily of million provided by proceeds from the sale of common stock  stock option exercises and stock purchase plan withholdings offset  in part  by million for payments of long term debt 
working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was million as of december   compared to million at december  this increase is primarily due to the receipt of the million upfront sublicense fee received in total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to the expansion of our facilities in bothell  washington and in budapest  hungary 
for  we expect to incur to million in capital expenditures as we expand our international lab and manufacturing footprint 
we currently have a revolving line of credit in the amount of million which has a maturity date in june the line of credit bears interest at a variable rate based on our company s leverage ratio 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the line of credit was million  bearing interest at a rate of 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum required operating cash flow coverage ratio  a minimum earnings before interest and taxes to interest ratio and a minimum current ratio 
other covenants include limits on asset disposals and the payment of dividends 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the credit facility 
working capital was million as of december   compared to million at december  the primary reasons for the increase were increases in contract and milestone revenue and the refinancing of current debt into a long term line of credit 
these increases were partially offset by the use of cash and investments to fund treasury share repurchases  capital expenditures and the acquisition of finekem 
we believe we have mitigated a potentially significant risk associated with auction rate securities  which are included in investment securities  available for sale  on our consolidated balance sheet  by reducing our balance of these types of securities from million at december  to million at december  total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were primarily related to the expansion of our research facilities in singapore  the expansion and modernization of our large scale facilities in india and modernization of our large scale manufacturing facilities in the us during  we generated million in cash for investing activities  primarily consisting of million for the acquisition of property and equipment and million related to the acquisition of finekem  partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities  net of purchases of these securities  of million 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting primarily of million for the purchase of treasury stock  offset  in part  by million provided by proceeds from the sale of common stock  stock option exercises and stock purchase plan withholdings 
during  we repurchased a total of million shares of common stock of our company at a total cost of million 
we continue to pursue the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
in february  the company acquired excelsyn ltd 
a chemical development and large scale manufacturing services company in north wales  uk 
under the terms of the agreement  amri has purchased all of the outstanding shares of excelsyn for approximately million in cash  which was funded from existing cash and cash equivalents 
we expect that additional expansion activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and or the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings 
future acquisitions  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing techniques that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total under year years years after years long term debt principal operating leases purchase commitments pension plan contributions related party transactions technology development incentive plan we have a technology development incentive plan to provide a method to stimulate and encourage novel innovative technology development 
to be eligible to participate  the individual must be an employee and must be the inventor of  co inventor of  or have made a significant intellectual contribution to novel technology that results in new revenues received by us 
eligible participants will share in awards based on a percentage of the licensing  royalty or milestone revenue received by us  as defined by the plan 
in  and we awarded technology incentive compensation primarily to thomas d ambra  our chairman  president and chief executive officer and the inventor of the terfenadine carboxylic acid metabolite technology  which is covered by the company s patents relating to the active ingredient in allegra 
in  and  awards were granted in relation to the milestone payment from bms made pursuant to the licensing and research agreement between the company and bms 
the amounts awarded and included in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and are million  million and million  respectively 
included in accrued compensation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at both december  and are unpaid technology development incentive compensation awards of approximately million and million  respectively 
telecommunication services a member of the company s board of directors is the chief executive officer of one of the providers of telephone and internet services to the company
