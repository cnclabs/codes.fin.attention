risk factors 
our business and results of operations are substantially dependent upon the demand for ate by semiconductor manufacturers and companies that specialize in the testing of ics 
demand for ate is driven by semiconductor manufacturers that are opening new  or expanding existing  semiconductor fabrication facilities or upgrading existing equipment  which in turn is dependent upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and products incorporating semiconductors 
in the past  the semiconductor industry has been highly cyclical with recurring periods of oversupply  which often have a severe impact on the semiconductor industry s demand for ate  including the products we manufacture 
this can cause wide fluctuations in both our orders and net revenues and  depending on our ability to react quickly to these shifts in demand  can significantly impact our results of operations 
these industry cycles are difficult to predict and in recent years have become more volatile and  in most cases  shorter in duration 
because the industry cycles are generally characterized by sequential periods of growth or declines in orders and net revenues during each cycle  year over year comparisons of operating results may not always be as meaningful as comparisons of periods at similar points in either up or down cycles 
in addition  during both downward and upward cycles in our industry  in any given quarter  the trend in both our orders and net revenues can be erratic 
this can occur  for example  when orders are canceled or currently scheduled delivery dates are accelerated or postponed by a significant customer or when customer forecasts and general business conditions fluctuate during a quarter 
we believe that purchases of most of our products are typically made from semiconductor manufacturers capital expenditure budgets 
certain portions of our business  however  are generally less dependent upon the capital expenditure budgets of the end users 
for example  purchases of certain related ate interface products  such as sockets and interface boards  which must be replaced periodically  are typically made from the end users operating budgets 
in addition  purchases of certain of our products  such as docking hardware  for the purpose of upgrading or improving the utilization  performance and efficiency of existing ate  tend to be counter cyclical to sales of new ate 
moreover  we believe a portion of our sales of thermal products results from the increasing need for temperature testing of circuit boards and specialized components that do not have the design or quantity to be tested in an electronic device handler 
in addition  in recent years we have begun to market our thermostream temperature ma nagement systems in industries outside semiconductor test  such as the automotive  aerospace  medical and telecommunications industries 
we believe that these industries usually are less cyclical than the ate industry 
during  the deterioration in the global economy that began in continued to have a significant negative impact on the demand for ate 
all of our product segments experienced declines in demand during this period 
during  our consolidated orders declined million or as compared to adjusted to eliminate the orders of sigma systems corp 
sigma  which we acquired in october as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our consolidated orders would have declined million or 
we believe the significant declines in our orders during were due to the reduction in demand for ate resulting from falling ate utilization rates at our customers  who have experienced weakened demand for their products due to the global economic recession 
although as a whole experienced lower levels of demand than in  during the second quarter of  we started to see some positive indicators in the industry 
this increase in demand in the ate indust ry resulted in sequential quarterly growth in both our orders and net intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued revenues during the second  third and fourth quarters of our consolidated orders increased from the first to the second quarter of  from the second to the third quarter of and from the third to the fourth quarter of our consolidated net revenues increased from the first to the second quarter of  from the second to the third quarter of and from the third to the fourth quarter of while the majority of our orders and net revenues are derived from the ate market  our operating results do not always follow the overall trend in the ate market in any given period 
we believe that these anomalies may be driven by a variety of changes within the ate market  including  for example  changing product requirements  longer time periods between new product offerings by oems and changes in customer buying patterns 
in particular  demand for our mechanical and electrical products  which are sold exclusively within the ate industry  and our operating margins in these product segments have been affected by shifts in the competitive landscape  including i customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity increasing unit costs and ordering in smaller quantities which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower cost and increasing unit costs  ii the increasing practice of o em manufacturers to specify other suppliers as primary vendors  with less frequent opportunities to compete for such designations  iii the increased role of third party test and assembly houses in the ate market and their requirement of products with a greater range of use at the lowest cost  and iv customer supply line management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors 
in addition  due to the current global recession several semiconductor manufacturers have failed  which has resulted in a significant amount of used ate equipment coming onto the market  which has reduced demand for certain types of new ate equipment 
while the supply of used equipment on the market has negatively impacted demand in all our product segments  we believe our thermal products segment has experienced a higher level of loss of current sales due to this issue 
we currently expect the increased demand for ate equipment will consume the supply of used equipment within several quarters  but w e cannot determine with any degree of certainty when this issue of oversupply of used equipment will cease 
these shifts in market practices have had  and may continue to have  varying levels of impact on our operating results  which are difficult to quantify or predict from period to period 
management has taken  and will continue to take  such actions it deems appropriate to adjust our strategies  products and operations to counter such shifts in market practices as they become evident 
net revenues and orders the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a breakdown of the net revenues from unaffiliated customers both by product segment and geographic area based on the location of the selling entity 
years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers mechanical products thermal products electrical products intersegment sales intersegment sales mechanical products thermal products electrical products net revenues from unaffiliated customers net of intersegment sales mechanical products thermal products electrical products intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued years ended december  net revenues from unaffiliated customers us europe asia pacific our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million or as compared to the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our mechanical  thermal and electrical products segments decreased  and  respectively  during as compared to adjusted to exclude the net revenues of sigma  our consolidated net revenues would have decreased by million or and the net revenues net of intersegment sales of our thermal products segment  in which the results of sigma are included  would have decreased by in as compared to as previously mentioned  we have seen a positive trend in our net revenues in the last three quarters of our consolidated net revenues for the fourth quarter of  increased compared to the third quarter of the year and compared to the first quarter of total orders for the year ended december  decreased to million on a consolidated basis as compared to million for for our mechanical  thermal and electrical products segments  total orders for were million  million and million  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  for adjusted to exclude the orders of sigma  total consolidated orders for would have been million as compared to million for and total orders for our thermal products segment for would have been million as compared to million for however  similar to the recent trend in our net revenues noted above  our consolidated orders for the fourth quarter of  increased compared to the third quarter of the year and compared to the first quarter of during  our net revenues from customers in the us decreased 
after adjustment to eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  our net revenues from customers in europe and asia decreased and  respectively  during as compared to the larger percentage decrease in our net revenues from customers in europe and asia primarily reflects the closure of our intestlogic operation in germany during the fourth quarter of and the closure of our operation in japan during in addition  during  we ceased manufacturing mechanical products in our operation in singapore 
sales that would have been handled by these operations are now handled through our operation in cherry hill  new jersey 
backlog at december   our backlog of unfilled orders for all products was approximately million compared with approximately million at december  our backlog includes customer orders which we have accepted  substantially all of which we expect to deliver in while backlog is calculated on the basis of firm purchase orders  a customer may cancel an order or accelerate or postpone currently scheduled delivery dates 
our backlog may be affected by the tendency of customers to rely on short lead times available from suppliers  including us  in periods of depressed demand 
in periods of increased demand  there is a tendency towards longer lead times that has the effect of increasing backlog 
as a result  our backlog at a particular date is not necessarily indicative of sales for any future period 
business restructuring initiatives in early  we commenced a review of our operations to more aggressively streamline our cost structure in line with the current business environment 
the review of our operations is on going 
as part of this process  we are focusing on methods to increase our profitability worldwide  including pursuing other types of revenue streams and additional growth opportunities 
in the latter part of and throughout  we have also implemented several restructuring plans 
these restructuring plans have included workforce reductions  facility closures and consolidations  and other temporary and permanent salary and benefit reductions for most remaining employees 
these actions are described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition  in april  we retained a financial advisor to assist us in assessing our strategic alternatives to enhance operating performance and shareholder value 
we determined that under then current market conditions and with our then current resources  our goals were to continue conserving cash  reducing costs and generating sales of our products 
since that time  we have implemented strategies consistent with those goals and remain committed to those objectives 
we also continue to consider other alternatives as we may deem appropriate 
while these strategies appear to have been effective in allowing us to reach our goals  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in generating sufficient additional sales and conserving cash 
if we do not continue to generate additional sales or conserve our cash position  then we will need to obtain financing to satisfy our working capital needs 
we are not certain that such financial will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  if a nd when we need it 
see item a 
risk factors 
the increase in our net revenues during the fourth quarter of  as previously mentioned  combined with the impact of certain of our restructuring plans which were implemented earlier in the year  resulted in profitability on a consolidated basis in the fourth quarter of we currently expect that our orders in the first quarter of will be above the level we achieved in the fourth quarter of in light of this  we expect that we will be profitable on a consolidated basis in the first quarter of based on the increased level of our orders and our forecasts that indicate that we will continue to experience this higher level of net revenues and  accordingly  profitability  we restored all of the temporary salary reductions we implemented in and for our domestic employees  effective january   with the exception of the salary of our executive chairman  which was restored to approximately of its full reinstated level effective january   reflecting a voluntary contin ued reduction in his salary 
we currently plan to restore the k plan discretionary matching contribution for all domestic employees on april  this discretionary matching contribution was suspended for most of these employees at the beginning of we continue to explore other methods to improve our profitability including further facility consolidation 
impairment charges generally accepted accounting principles require us to perform at least an annual assessment for impairment of goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets and to monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
at december  and  we had goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets which totaled million 
at december  and  we also had long lived assets which totaled million and million  respectively 
these long lived assets consisted of finite lived intangible assets of  and  respectively  and property and equipment of  and  respectively 
during  we recorded an impairment charge for goodwill of  and we recorded an impairment charge related to long lived assets of million 
there were no similar charges recorded in please refer to note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our annua l goodwill  intangible and long lived asset impairment review process  as well as the charges that resulted from this process in acquisitions in july  we acquired the assets of diamond integration  llc  diamond a business that provides post warranty service for ate equipment to semiconductor manufacturers 
the total cost to acquire these assets was  the results of diamond are included in our mechanical products segment 
please see note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for detail of the purchase price allocation 
on october   we acquired sigma  a manufacturer of thermal platforms  custom configured environmental chambers and other environmental test solutions for a variety of industries including automotive  medical pharmaceutical  electronic  aerospace defense and ate 
sigma is included in our thermal products segment and has expanded our product offerings outside the ate market 
we believe sigma s products are highly complementary to our other thermal products and will greatly facilitate our further penetration into non ate markets 
the purchase price was approximately million and was paid with million in cash   shares of our common stock  and the issuance of non negotiable promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to million 
in addition  during the closing of the transaction we repaid  of debt on the books of sigma and incurred transaction costs of  please see note of the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements for detail of the purchase pri ce allocation 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued excess and obsolete inventory charges on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record charges for excess and obsolete inventory based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional excess and obsolete inventory charges are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the excess and obsolete inventory charges we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
we incurred charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million for each of the years ended december  and the level of these charges was based upon a variety of factors  including changes in demand for our products and new product designs 
see also the section entitled critical accounting policies 
during the years ended december  and we utilized  and  respectively  of material in production that had been written off as obsolete in prior periods 
when previously written off inventory material is used in production  it has a zero cost basis and as a result  has the impact of improving our gross margin in the period used 
for the years ended december  and  the use of inventory which had previously been determined to be obsolete  did not materially change our gross margin 
product warranty charges we accrue product warranty charges quarterly  based upon our historical claims experience 
in addition  from time to time  we accrue additional amounts based upon known product warranty issues  such as product retrofits 
for the years ended december  and  our product warranty charges were  and  or and of net revenues  respectively 
the level of our product warranty charges both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues is affected by a number of factors including the cyclicality of demand in the ate industry  the prototype nature of much of our business  the complex nature of many of our products  the introduction of new product families which typically have higher levels of warranty claims than existing product families  and  at our discretion  providing warranty repairs or replacements to customers after the contracted warranty period has expired in order to promote strong customer relations 
see also critical accounting policies 
product customer mix our three product segments each have multiple products that we design  manufacture and sell to our customers 
the gross margin on each product we offer is impacted by a number of factors including the amount of intellectual property such as patents utilized in the product  the number of units ordered by the customer at one time  or the amount of intest designed and fabricated material included in our product compared with the amount of third party designed and fabricated material included in our product 
the weight of each of these factors  as well as the current market conditions  determines the ultimate sales price we can obtain for our products and the resulting gross margin 
the mix of products we sell in any period is ultimately determined by our customers needs 
therefore  the mix of products sold in any given period can change significantly from the prior period 
as a result  our consolidated gross margin can be significantly impacted in any given period by a change in the mix of products sold in that period 
we sell most of our products to semiconductor manufacturers and third party test and assembly houses end user sales and to ate manufacturers oem sales who ultimately resell our equipment with theirs to semiconductor manufacturers 
our thermal products segment also sells into a variety of other industries including the aerospace  automotive  communications  consumer electronics  defense  and medical industries 
the mix of customers during any given period will affect our gross margin due to differing sales discounts and commissions 
for the years ended december  and  our oem sales as a percentage of net revenues were and  respectively  and our sales of thermal products in other industries outside the ate industry as a percentage of net revenues were and  respectively 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued oem sales generally have a lower gross margin than end user sales  as oem sales historically have had a more significant discount 
our current net operating margins on most oem sales  however  are only slightly less than margins on end user sales because of the payment of third party sales commissions on most end user sales 
we have also continued to experience demands from our oem customers supply line managers to reduce our sales prices to them 
if we cannot further reduce our manufacturing and operating costs  these pricing pressures will continue to reduce our gross and operating margins 
risk factors please see item a risk factors for a discussion of other important factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our prior results or those expressed or implied by our forward looking statements 
results of operations all of our products are used by semiconductor manufacturers in conjunction with ate in the testing of ics 
consequently  the results of operations for each product segment are generally affected by the same factors 
separate discussions and analyses for each product segment would be repetitive and obscure any unique factors that affected the results of operations of our different product segments 
the discussion and analysis that follows  therefore  is presented on a consolidated basis for the company as a whole and includes discussion of factors unique to each product segment where significant to an understanding of each segment 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the principal items included in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total net revenues 
percentage of net revenues years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling expense engineering and product development expense general and administrative expense impairment of long lived assets impairment of goodwill restructuring and other charges operating loss other income loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million or 
our net revenues during and included million and  respectively  of net revenues attributable to sigma  which we acquired in october  as previously discussed 
we believe the significant decline in our net revenues during primarily reflects the impact which the current global economic recession has had on the demand for ate  as previously discussed in the overview 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during  our net revenues from customers in the us  europe and asia decreased  and  respectively  as compared to adjusted to eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the decrease in net revenues from customers in europe and asia would have been and  respectively 
the higher percentage decreases from our customers in europe and asia primarily reflect the closure of our intestlogic subsidiary in germany during the fourth quarter of  the cessation of sales by our japanese subsidiary during the second quarter of which was finally closed during the fourth quarter of and the decision to stop manufacturing mechanical products in our singaporean operation  also during the second quarter of sales that would have been made by these operations are now handled by our cherry hill  new jersey operation 
gross margin 
gross margin was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the decrease in gross margin is primarily the result of an increase in our fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues 
although our fixed operating costs decreased million in absolute dollar terms during as compared to  these costs were not as fully absorbed due to the significantly lower net revenues levels 
as a result  these costs increased to of net revenues in from of net revenues in the million decrease in the absolute dollar amount of our fixed operating costs primarily represents lower salaries and benefits expense reflecting the impact of our restructuring initiatives 
to a lesser extent  depreciation expense and the cost of our corporate insurance policies also decreased in compared to the reduction in depreciation expense was a result of the impairment of long lived assets in both our mechanical and electrical products segments during the fourth quarter of the decrease in the cost of our corporate insurance policies reflects the lower headcount and revenue levels upon which much of the premiums for these policies are based 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in costs associated with diamond in as compared to we had twelve months of expense for diamond in compared to six months of expense in we acquired diamond in july  as previously discussed 
in addition to the increase in our fixed operating costs as a percentage of net revenues  our charges for excess and obsolete inventory increased as a percentage of net revenues for as compared to although the absolute dollar value of these charges was relatively unchanged  they were not as fully absorbed due to the significant reduction in the level of our net revenues 
the increases as a percentage of net revenues in our fixed operating costs and our charges for excess and obsolete inventory were partially offset by a decrease in our component material costs as a percentage of net revenues  reflecting changes in product and customer mix 
our component material costs were of net revenues during as compared to of net revenues in selling expense 
selling expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in selling expense primarily reflects both a reduction in salaries and benefits expense  reflecting the aforementioned restructuring initiatives we have implemented and lower levels of commissions  as a result of the significant decline in net revenues experienced in as compared to to a lesser extent there was also a reduction in travel costs  advertising and trade show related expenditures and freight costs  primarily reflecting reduced attendance at trade shows and fewer sales personnel traveling during as compared to engineering and product development expense 
engineering and product development expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in engineering and product development expense primarily reflects lower salaries and benefits expense as a result of the aforementioned restructuring initiatives we have implemented 
to a lesser extent  there were also decreases in spending on research and development materials  legal fees related to our intellectual property and the use of third party consultants during as compared to during  we had a higher level of ongoing development efforts related to a new family of manipulators which we introduced during the latter part of general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily a result of lower levels of salaries and benefits expense reflecting the impact of our restructuring initiatives 
to a lesser extent  there was also a reduction in professional fees for third party consultants who assist us with the documentation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting procedures and related compliance matters and fees paid to our outside directors  also reduced as part of our restructuring initiatives 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period in the charges incurred during and represented one time termination benefits and facility closure costs related to our various restructuring plans which are more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
during  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our mechanical products and electrical products segments  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for these segments  we recorded a charge of million for the partial impairment of certain long lived assets 
the impaired assets which are allocated to our electrical products segment include property and equipment 
the impaired assets which are allocated to our mechanical products segment include intangible assets which consist of the patent applications held by our intestlogic subsidiary at the time of our acquisition of this operation in  a customer list and a non compete agreement which resulted from our acquisition of diamond in july  as well as certain property and equipment held by our cherry hill  new jersey manufacturing facility and our japanese sales and distribution operation 
there were no similar charges during impairment of goodwill 
during  due to the significant operating losses experienced by our mechanical products segment  combined with our forecasts that indicated potential future losses for this segment  we recorded a charge of  which represented the full impairment of the goodwill that resulted from the acquisition of diamond in july there were no similar charges during please refer to note of the footnotes of our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our annual goodwill  intangible and long lived asset impairment review process  as well as the charges that resulted from that process in other income expense 
other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the comparable period in  a decrease of  the decrease in other income is primarily a result of a reduction in interest income as a result of a lower average cash balance during this decrease was partially offset by the recording of a  foreign exchange transaction gain related to the final dissolution of our subsidiary in japan during the fourth quarter of income tax expense benefit 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  for the same period in on a quarterly basis  we record income tax expense or benefit based on the expected annualized effective tax rate for the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate our businesses 
due to our history of operating losses in both our domestic and certain of our foreign operations  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets of these operations  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period in the increase in net cash used in operations reflects in part a lower level of non cash charges in as compared to as well as changes in working capital due to our improved operating results in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of and the closure of our japanese subsidiary 
during  accounts receivable increased million reflecting the significant increase in our net revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of during  other assets decreased  primarily as a result of the termination of several life insurance policies held by our japanese subsidiary 
the cash surrender value of these policies was included in these assets on our balance sheet 
these policies were terminated in connection with the decision to close this operation  as the policies served as the retirement assets for th e employees of this operation 
the amounts owed to our employees in japan related to these policies were recorded as accrued wages and benefits 
accrued wages and benefits decreased  during  primarily reflecting the payment of the aforementioned liabilities to our japanese employees  and  to a lesser extent  lower headcount at december  as compared to december  the reduction in headcount reflects the various restructuring actions taken during  as discussed in the overview 
inventories decreased million primarily reflecting the reduced levels of demand in which resulted in charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million being recorded during this period 
accounts payable increased  primarily as a result of the recent increases in the level of our orders 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued purchases of property and equipment were  for the year ended december  currently  we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures for  however  depending upon changes in market demand  we may make such purchases as we deem necessary and appropriate 
we will be relocating the mechanical product segment operations and corporate staff currently occupying our cherry hill  new jersey facility into a smaller facility located in mount laurel  new jersey during the fourth quarter of we are currently in the process of obtaining proposals for the various costs associated with this move and do not yet have a complete estimate of the total capital expenditures that we will incur to complete this move 
the landlord for the new mount laurel facility will be providing the majority of the tenant improvement dollars for this facility  which we will amortize over the life of the lease as deferred rental expense 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  which represents payments made under capital lease obligations 
we have a secured credit facility that provides for maximum borrowings of  we have not used this credit facility to borrow any funds 
our usage consists of the issuance of letters of credit in the face amount of  this facility had been secured by all the assets of intest corporation  temptronic corporation and intest silicon valley corporation  excluding all patents  trademarks and applications for same 
during the quarter ended september   we agreed with the lender who provides this secured credit facility to release their liens against the assets of our operations in exchange for pledged certificates of deposit totaling  the loan agreement for this facility contained certain negative covenants regarding  among other things  acquisitions and additional debt 
in  we had notified the lender that our acquisitions may have violated these covenants and the lender has provided waivers of those covenant violations as well as eliminated those covenants going forward 
we pay a quarterly fee of per annum on the total amount of the outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
at february   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  in light of deteriorating conditions in the semiconductor industry and the global economic recession  we initiated a series of restructuring and cost reduction programs during the fourth quarter of  which continued throughout  as previously discussed  in order to conserve cash and reduce costs 
in april  we retained the services of a financial advisor to assist us in assessing our strategic alternatives to enhance operating performance and stockholder value 
we determined that under the then current market conditions and with our then current resources  our goals were to continue conserving cash  reducing costs and generating sales of our products 
since that time  we have implemented strategies consistent with those goals and remain committed to those objectives 
we also continue to consider other alternatives as we may deem appropriate 
while thes e strategies appear to have been effective in allowing us to reach our goals  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in generating sufficient additional sales and conserving cash 
if we do not continue to generate additional sales or conserve our cash position  we will need to obtain financing to satisfy our working capital needs 
we are not certain that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  if and when we need it 
while we currently expect our cash and cash equivalents and projected future cash flow to be sufficient to support our near term working capital requirements  in light of the increased demand for our products and our current plans to restore salaries for our domestic employees in early  we may need additional working capital in consequently  in late october  we retained the services of a third party financial intermediary that specializes in debt placements for companies in distressed situations to assist us in soliciting proposals from lenders to provide us with a revolving line of credit of up to million secured by the assets of our domestic operations 
late in the fourth quarter of  we received lending proposals from several institutions that were willing to consider providing a committed working capital facility secured by the assets of our domestic operations excluding the assets of sigma which secure the notes payable to stockholders resulting from the acquisition of sigma 
in light of the increased bookings and revenues we experienced in the fourth quarter of and our belief that these improvements would continue into as well as the reduction in the burn rate of our cash during the fourth quarter due to these improved business results and our forecast that we would begin to build cash and cash equivalents in the second quarter of  management chose to not incur the costs associated with moving forward with the lender s final due diligence related to putting a working capital facility in place as we did not believe the facility would be needed 
while we believe we could move forward with putting a committed working capital facility in place with any one of the lenders who provided proposals to us  we cannot be certain that the proposed lending terms would still be offered to us by the lenders or that the terms offered to us would be satisfactory to us or that we would be successful in closing the working capital facility 
intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we have incurred significant losses in four of the last five years including losses in  and these losses were attributable to operations as well as to charges for impairments and restructurings 
we have managed our liquidity during this time primarily through a series of cost reduction initiatives 
as previously discussed  we presently see positive indicators in all of our segments 
our bookings for the fourth quarter of increased to million as compared to million for the third quarter of the year  and we currently expect that our orders in the first quarter of will be above the level we achieved in the fourth quarter of in light of this  we expect that we will be profitable on a consolidated basis in the first quarter of however  we cannot be certain that the downturn is reversing or that we will have sufficient cash to continue to operate 
consequently  we continue to remain focused on methods to restructure our business and reduce our cash burn or to iden tify appropriate strategic alternatives 
we do not currently have any available credit facilities under which we can borrow to help fund our working capital requirements 
we cannot be certain that  if needed  we would be able to obtain any credit facilities or under what terms such credit facilities would be available 
new or recently adopted accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning the implementation and impact of new or recently adopted accounting standards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  long lived assets  goodwill  identifiable intangibles  deferred income tax valuation allowances and product warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ ma rkedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were prepared 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at standard cost  which approximates actual cost computed on a first in  first out basis  not in excess of market value 
on a quarterly basis  we review our inventories and record excess and obsolete inventory charges based upon our established objective excess and obsolete inventory criteria 
these criteria identify material that has not been used in a work order during the prior twelve months and the quantity of material on hand that is greater than the average annual usage of that material over the prior three years 
in certain cases  additional charges for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based upon current industry conditions  anticipated product life cycles  new product introductions and expected future use of the inventory 
the charges for excess and obsolete inventory that we record establish a new cost basis for the related inventory 
in  we recorded an inventory obsolescence charge for excess and obsolete inventory of million 
long lived asset valuation we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could indicate impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the asset or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we prepare projections of operations for our product segments intest corporation form k for the year ended december  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued where these intangibles and or long lived assets are associated 
if the carrying value of the intangible assets and or long lived assets exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of our projections  then we would measure the impairment charge 
we measure the impairment based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
at december   identifiable intangibles and long lived assets were million

goodwill at least annually  we review our goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values 
if the result of this analysis is that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets  resulting in an implied valuation of goodwill associated with the reporting unit 
we would measure the impairment based on the difference between the implied valuation of the goodwill and its actual carrying value 
as of december   goodwill was million

income taxes deferred tax assets are analyzed to determine if there will be sufficient taxable income in the future in order to realize such assets 
we assess all of the positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of the deferred tax assets  including our historical results of operations for the recent past and our projections of future results of operations  in which we make subjective determinations of future events 
if  after assessing all of the evidence  both positive and negative  a determination is made that the realizability of the deferred tax assets is not more likely than not  we establish a deferred tax valuation allowance for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets depending upon the specific facts 
if any of the significant assumptions were changed  materially different results could occur  which could significantly change the amount of the deferred tax valuation allowance established 
as of december   due to our history of operating losses  we have a valuation allowance aga inst all deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  where we believe it is more likely than not that we will not have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets before they expire 
product warranty accrual in connection with the accrual of warranty costs associated with our products  we make assumptions about the level of product failures that may occur in the future 
these assumptions are primarily based upon historical claims experience 
should the rate of future product failures significantly differ from historical levels  our accrued warranty reserves would need to be adjusted  and the amount of the adjustment could be material 
at december   accrued warranty was  and we recorded charges related to product warranty of  for the year then ended
