factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas  production volumes  estimates of proved reserves  capital expenditures  economic and competitive conditions  regulatory changes and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual repor  particularly in item a risk factors and forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
overview we are a publicly traded limited liability company focused on the acquisition and development of mature  long lived natural gas and oil properties in the united states 
our primary business objective is to generate stable cash flows allowing us to make quarterly cash distributions to our unitholders and over time to increase our quarterly cash distributions through the acquisition of new natural gas and oil properties 
as of december   our properties are located in the southern portion of the appalachian basin  primarily in southeast kentucky and northeast tennessee  the permian basin  primarily in west texas and southeastern new mexico  and in south texas 
at december   we owned working interests in  gross  net productive wells 
in addition to these productive wells  we own leasehold acreage allowing us to drill new wells 
as of december   we had a working interest in approximately  gross undeveloped acres surrounding or adjacent to our existing wells located in the appalachian basin 
in south texas and the permian basin we own working interests ranging from in approximately  undeveloped acres surrounding our existing wells 
approximately or bcfe of our estimated proved reserves were attributable to our working interests in undeveloped acreage 
initial public offering in october  we completed our ipo of million units representing limited liability interests in vnr at per unit for net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and fees of million 
in addition  we incurred offering costs of million in connection with the ipo 
the proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness under our reserve based credit facility by million and the balance was used for the payment of accrued distributions to pre ipo unitholders and the payment of a deferred swap obligation 
shelf registration statement during the third quarter  we filed a registration statement with the sec which registered offerings of up to million of any combination of debt securities  common units and guarantees of debt securities by our subsidiaries 
net proceeds  terms and pricing of the offering of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings 
the shelf registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
our ability to utilize the shelf registration statement for the purpose of issuing  from time to time  any combination of debt securities or common units will depend upon  among other things  market conditions and the existence of investors who wish to purchase our securities at prices acceptable to us 
in august  we completed an offering of million of our common units 
the units were offered to the public at a price of per unit 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts of million and offering costs of million 
in december  we completed an offering of million of our common units 
the units were offered to the public at a price of per unit 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering  after deducting underwriting discounts of million and offering costs of million 
we paid million of the proceeds from this offering to redeem  common units from our largest unitholder 
as a result of these offerings  we have approximately million remaining available under our shelf registration statement as of december  permian basin acquisition on december   we entered in to a purchase and sale agreement with the apache corporation for the purchase of certain natural gas and oil properties located in ten separate fields in the permian basin of west texas and southeastern new mexico  referred to as the permian basin acquisition 
the purchase price for said assets was million with an effective date of october  we completed this acquisition on january  for an adjusted purchase price of million  subject to customary post closing adjustments 
the post closing adjustments reduced the final purchase price to million which included a purchase price adjustment of million for the cash flow from the acquired properties for the period between the effective date  october   and the final settlement date 
this acquisition was funded with borrowings under our reserve based credit facility 
through this acquisition  we acquired working interests in gross wells net wells  gross wells net wells of which we operate 
with respect to operations  we established two district offices  one in lovington  new mexico and the other in christoval  texas to manage these assets 
our operating focus has been on maximizing existing production and looking for complementary acquisitions that we can add to this operating platform 
as of december   based on a reserve report prepared by our independent reserve engineers  these acquired properties have estimated proved reserves of million barrels of oil equivalent  of which is oil and of which is proved developed producing 
dos hermanos acquisition on july   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with segundo navarro drilling  ltd 
segundo  a wholly owned subsidiary of the lewis energy group  for the acquisition of certain natural gas and oil properties located in the dos hermanos field in webb county  texas  referred to as the dos hermanos acquisition 
the purchase price for said assets was million with an effective date of june  we completed this acquisition on july  for an adjusted purchase price of million  subject to customary post closing adjustments 
this acquisition was funded with million of borrowings under our reserve based credit facility and through the issuance of  common units of the company 
in this purchase  we acquired an average of a working interest in producing wells and an average working interest in approximately  gross acres with identified proved undeveloped locations 
an affiliate of lewis energy group operates all the properties and is contractually obligated to drill seven wells each year from through unless mutually agreed not to do so 
upon closing this transaction  we assumed natural gas swaps and collars based on houston ship channel pricing for approximately of the estimated gas production from existing producing wells for the period beginning july through december which had a fair value of million on july  as of december   based on a reserve report prepared by our independent reserve engineers  these acquired properties have estimated proved reserves of bcfe  of which is natural gas and natural gas liquids and of which is proved developed producing 
sun tsh acquisition on july   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire certain natural gas and oil properties located in the sun tsh field in la salle county  texas for million from segundo  referred to as the sun tsh acquisition 
the acquisition had a july  effective date and was completed on august  for an adjusted purchase price of million  subject to customary post closing adjustments 
an affiliate of lewis operates all of the wells acquired in this transaction 
this acquisition was funded with borrowings under our reserve based credit facility and proceeds from the company s public equity offering of million common units completed on august  at closing  we assumed natural gas puts and swaps based on nymex pricing for approximately of the estimated gas production from existing producing wells in the acquired properties for the period beginning august of through december of  which had a fair value of million on the closing date 
in addition  concurrent with the execution of the purchase and sale agreement  we entered into a collar for certain volumes in and a series of collars for a substantial portion of the expected gas production for at prices above the then current market with a total cost to the company of million which was financed through deferred premiums 
inclusive of the hedges added  approximately of the estimated gas production from existing producing wells in the acquired properties is hedged through as of december   based on a reserve report prepared by our independent reserve engineers  these acquired properties have estimated proved reserves of bcfe  of which is natural gas and natural gas liquids and is proved developed producing 
ward county acquisition on november   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement  lease amendment and lease royalty conveyance agreement and a conveyance agreement to acquire certain producing natural gas and oil properties located in ward county  texas in the permian basin from private sellers  referred to as the ward county acquisition 
this transaction had an effective date of october  and was closed on december  for million  subject to customary post closing adjustments 
this acquisition was initially funded with borrowings under our reserve based credit facility with borrowings being reduced by million shortly thereafter with the proceeds from a million common unit offering 
we will operate all but one of the ten wells acquired in this transaction 
as of december   based on a reserve report prepared by our independent reserve engineers  these acquired properties have estimated proved reserves of million barrels of oil equivalent  of which is oil and is proved developed 
in an effort to support stable cash flows from this transaction  we entered into crude oil swaps based on nymex pricing for approximately of the estimated oil production from existing producing wells in the acquired properties for the period beginning january through december disruption to functioning of capital markets multiple events during and involving numerous financial institutions have effectively restricted liquidity within the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
while capital markets remain volatile  efforts by treasury and banking regulators in the united states  europe and other nations around the world to provide liquidity to the financial sector have improved the situation 
as evidenced by our recent successful equity offerings  successful amendment of our reserve based credit facility and recent successful equity and debt offerings by our peers  we believe that our access to capital has improved and we have been successful in improving our financial position to date 
during  our unit price increased from a closing low of on january  to a closing high of on december  also during  we did not drill any wells on our operated properties and there was limited drilling on non operated properties 
we intend to move forward with our development drilling program when market conditions allow for an adequate return on the drilling investment and only when we have sufficient liquidity to do so 
maintaining adequate liquidity may involve the issuance of debt and equity at less attractive terms  could involve the sale of non core assets and could require reductions in our capital spending 
in the near term we will focus on maximizing returns on existing assets by managing our costs  selectively deploying capital to improve existing production and drilling a limited number of wells which we believe will provide an adequate return on the investment 
our relationship with vinland on april  but effective as of january   we entered into various agreements with vinland  under which we rely on vinland to operate our existing producing wells in appalachia and coordinate our development drilling program in appalachia 
we expect to benefit from the substantial development and operational expertise of vinland management in the appalachian basin 
under a management services agreement  vinland advises and consults with us regarding all aspects of our production and development operations in appalachia and provides us with administrative support services as necessary for the operation of our business 
in addition  under a gathering and compression agreement that we entered into with vinland energy gathering  llc veg  veg gathers  compresses  delivers and provides the services necessary for us to market our natural gas production in the area of mutual interest  or ami 
veg will deliver our natural gas production to certain designated interconnects with third party transporters 
restructuring plan prior to the separation  our predecessor owned all of the assets in appalachia that are currently owned by us and vinland 
as part of the separation of our operating company and vinland  effective january   we conveyed to vinland of our predecessor s working interest in the known producing horizons in approximately  gross undeveloped acres in the ami  of our predecessor s interest in an additional  undeveloped acres and certain coalbed methane rights located in the appalachian basin  the rights to any natural gas and oil located on our acreage at depths above and feet below our known producing horizons  all of our gathering and compression assets and all employees except  our president and chief executive officer and our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
we retained all of our predecessor s proved producing wells and associated reserves 
we also retained of our predecessor s working interest in the known producing horizons in approximately  gross undeveloped acres in the ami and a contract right to receive approximately of the net proceeds  after deducting royalties paid to other parties  severance taxes  third party transportation costs  costs incurred in the operation of wells and overhead costs  from the sale of production from certain producing natural gas and oil wells  which accounted for approximately of our estimated proved reserves as of december  in addition  we changed the name of our operating company from nami holding company  llc to vanguard natural gas  llc 
collectively  we refer to these events as the restructuring 
private offering in april  we completed a private equity offering pursuant to which we issued  units to certain private investors  which we collectively refer to as the private investors  for million 
we used the net proceeds of this private equity offering to make a distribution to majeed s 
nami  vnr s largest unitholder  who used a portion of these funds to capitalize vinland and also paid us million to reduce outstanding accounts receivable from vinland 
we then used the million to repay borrowings and interest under our reserve based credit facility  and for general limited liability company purposes 
under the terms of the private offering  all outstanding units accrued distributions at annually from the closing of the private offering to september  and then distributions payable to the private investors only increased to until the completion of the ipo at which time all accrued distributions totaling million were paid 
reserve based credit facility on january   we entered into a reserve based credit facility which is available for our general limited liability company purposes  including  without limitation  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our obligations under the reserve based credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets 
our initial borrowing base under the reserve based credit facility was set at million 
however  the borrowing base was subject to million reductions per month starting on july  through november   which resulted in a borrowing base of million as reaffirmed in november pursuant to a semi annual borrowing base redetermination 
we applied million of our net proceeds from our ipo in october to reduce our indebtedness under our reserve based credit facility 
additional borrowings under our reserve based credit facility were made in january in connection with the acquisition of natural gas and oil properties in the permian basin 
in february  our reserve based credit facility was amended and restated to extend the maturity from january  to march   increase the maximum facility amount from million to million  increase our borrowing base from million to million and add two additional financial institutions as lenders  wachovia bank  na and the bank of nova scotia 
in may  our reserve based credit facility was amended in anticipation of a potential acquisition that ultimately did not occur 
as a result  none of the provisions included in this amendment went into effect 
in july an additional million was borrowed to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid in the dos hermanos acquisition 
in october  we amended our reserve based credit facility which set our borrowing base under the facility at million pursuant to our semi annual redetermination and added a new lender  bbva compass bank 
in february  a third amendment was entered into which amended covenants to allow us to repurchase up to million of our own units 
in may  our borrowing base was set at million pursuant to our semi annual redetermination 
in june  a fourth amendment to our reserve based credit facility was entered into which temporarily increased the percentage of outstanding indebtedness for which interest rate derivatives could be used 
the percentage was increased from to but was to revert back to in one year at june in august  our reserve based credit facility was amended and restated to extend the maturity from march  to october   increase our borrowing base from million to million  increase our borrowing costs  permanently allow of our outstanding indebtedness to be covered under interest rate derivatives  and add two financial institutions as lenders  comerica bank and royal bank of canada 
on october   we entered into the first amendment to our second amended and restated credit agreement  which reduced our borrowing base under the reserve based credit facility from million to million pursuant to our semi annual redetermination and changed the definition of majority lenders from to 
all other terms under the reserve based credit facility remained the same 
in december  our borrowing base was increased from million to million pursuant to an interim redetermination requested by the company due the ward county acquisition 
indebtedness under the reserve based credit facility totaled million at december   and the applicable margins and other fees increase as the utilization of the borrowing base increases as follows borrowing base utilization percentage eurodollar loans margin abr loans margin commitment fee rate letter of credit fee our next borrowing base redetermination is scheduled for april utilizing our december  reserve report 
a decline in commodity prices could result in a determination to lower the borrowing base in the future and  in such case  we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base 
until the redetermination occurs  the amount of the potential reduction is uncertain  however  we do not anticipate that any reduction will be material to the borrowing base as a whole and would not inhibit our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
outlook our revenue  cash flow from operations and future growth depend substantially on factors beyond our control  such as access to capital  economic  political and regulatory developments  and competition from other sources of energy 
multiple events during and involving numerous financial institutions effectively restricted liquidity within the capital markets throughout the united states and around the world 
while capital markets remain volatile  efforts by treasury and banking regulators in the united states  europe and other nations around the world to provide liquidity to the financial sector appears to have improved the situation 
as evidenced by our recent successful equity offering  successful amendment of our reserve based credit facility and recent successful equity and debt offerings by our peers  we believe that our access to capital has improved and we have been successful in improving our financial position to date 
during  our unit price increased from a closing low of on january  to a closing high of on december  also during  we did not drill any wells on our operated properties and there was limited drilling on non operated properties 
we intend to move forward with our development drilling program when market conditions allow for an adequate return on the drilling investment and only when we have sufficient liquidity to do so 
maintaining adequate liquidity may involve the issuance of debt and equity at less attractive terms  could involve the sale of non core assets and could require reductions in our capital spending 
in the near term we will focus on maximizing returns on existing assets by managing our costs  selectively deploying capital to improve existing production and drilling a limited number of wells which we believe will provide an adequate return on the investment 
natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil prices historically have been volatile and may fluctuate widely in the future 
sustained periods of low prices for natural gas  natural gas liquids or oil could materially and adversely affect our financial position  our results of operations  the quantities of natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil reserves that we can economically produce  our access to capital and our ability to pay a distribution 
we have mitigated the volatility on our cash flows with natural gas price derivative contracts through and oil price derivative contracts through these hedges are placed on a portion of our proved producing and a portion of our total anticipated production during this time frame 
as natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil prices fluctuate  we will recognize non cash  unrealized gains and losses in our consolidated statement of operations related to the change in fair value of our commodity derivative contracts 
we face the challenge of natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil production declines 
as a given well s initial reservoir pressures are depleted  natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil production decreases  thus reducing our total reserves 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline both by drilling on our properties and acquiring additional reserves 
we will maintain our focus on controlling costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions  as well as controlling the corresponding costs necessary to produce such reserves 
during the year ended december   we did not drill any wells on our operated properties and there was limited drilling on non operated properties 
our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors  including the ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals and voluntary reductions in capital spending in a low commodity price environment 
any delays in drilling  completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact the rate of our production  which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and as a result  cash available for distribution 
in accordance with our business plan  we intend to invest the capital necessary to maintain our production at existing levels over the long term provided that it is economical to do so based on the commodity price environment 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to issue equity or debt securities on favorable terms  or at all  and we may be unable to refinance our reserve based credit facility when it expires 
additionally  due to the significant decline in commodity prices  our borrowing base under our reserve based credit facility may be re determined such that it will not provide for the working capital necessary to fund our capital spending program and could affect our ability to make distributions 
the next scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base is april results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial and operating data for the periods indicated

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil sales decreased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the key revenue measurements were as follows year ended december  percentage increase decrease net natural gas production appalachian gas mmcf permian gas mmcf south texas gas mmcf total natural gas production mmcf average appalachian daily gas production mcf day average permian daily gas production mcf day average south texas daily gas production mcf day average vanguard daily gas production mcf day average natural gas sales price per mcf net realized gas price  including hedges net realized gas price  excluding hedges net oil production appalachian oil bbls permian oil bbls south texas oil bbls n a total oil production bbls average appalachian daily oil production bbls day average permian daily oil production bbls day average south texas daily oil production bbls day n a average vanguard daily oil production bbls day average oil sales price per bbl net realized oil price  including hedges net realized oil price  excluding hedges net natural gas liquids production permian natural gas liquids gal south texas natural gas liquids gal total natural gas liquids production gal average permian daily natural gas liquids production gal day average south texas daily natural gas liquids production gal day average vanguard daily natural gas liquids production gal day average natural gas liquids sales price per gal net realized natural gas liquids price includes production from the permian basin and ward county acquisitions 
the ward county acquisition closed on december  and  as such  only approximately one month of operations is included in the year ended december  the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the ward county acquisition  based on the actual number of days from the acquisition closing date to the end of the reported period  was mcf day of natural gas  bbls day of oil and  gal day of natural gas liquids during the permian basin acquisition closed on january  and  as such  only eleven months of operations are included in the year ended december  the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the permian basin acquisition  based on the actual number of days from the acquisition closing date to the end of the reported period  was mcf day of natural gas  bbls day of oil and gal day of natural gas liquids during includes production from dos hermanos and sun tsh acquisitions 
the sun tsh acquisition closed on august  and  as such  only approximately four and one half months of operations are included in the year ended december  the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the sun tsh acquisition  based on the actual number of days from the acquisition closing date to the end of the reported period  was  mcf day of natural gas  bbls day of oil and  gal day of natural gas liquids during the dos hermanos acquisition closed on july  and  as such  only five months of operations are included in the year ended december  the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the dos hermanos acquisition  based on the actual number of days from the acquisition closing date to the end of the reported period  was  mcf day of natural gas and  gal day of natural gas liquids during excludes amortization of premiums paid and amortization of value on derivative contracts acquired 
the decrease in natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil sales during the year ended december  compared to the same period in was due primarily to the decreases in commodity prices 
we experienced a decrease in the average realized natural gas sales price received excluding hedges and a decrease in the average realized oil price excluding hedges 
the decrease in commodity prices was partially offset by a increase in our total production on a mcfe basis 
the increase in production for the year ended december  over the comparable period in  despite not drilling any new wells in  was primarily attributable to the impact from the dos hermanos  sun tsh and ward county acquisitions completed in july  august and december  respectively 
in appalachia  we experienced a decrease in natural gas production which was partially offset by a increase in oil production during year ended december  compared to the same period in for a net production decline of on a mcfe basis 
the decrease in natural gas production is largely attributable to our decision to not drill wells in due to low natural gas prices 
the increase in appalachian oil production was primarily due to our focus on completing to oil zones as oil prices increased during and recompleting to oil zones on existing natural gas wells in  which also adversely affected the amount of natural gas produced in hedging and price risk management activities during the year ended december   the company recognized million in losses on commodity cash flow hedges 
these amounts relate to derivative contracts that the company entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production and designated as cash flow hedges 
the loss on commodity cash flow hedges for the year ended december  relates to the amount that settled in and has been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during the year ended december   the company recognized a million realized gain on other commodity derivative contracts related to the settlements recognized during the period and a million loss related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the volatility in our operating cash flow 
depending on the type of derivative contract used  hedging generally achieves this by the counterparty paying us when commodity prices are below the hedged price and we pay the counterparty when commodity prices are above the hedged price 
in either case  the impact on our operating cash flow is approximately the same 
however  because the majority of our hedges are not designated as cash flow hedges  there can be a significant amount of volatility in our earnings when we record the change in the fair value of all of our derivative contracts 
as commodity prices fluctuate  the fair value of those contracts will fluctuate and the impact is reflected as a non cash  unrealized gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
however  these fair value changes that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations only reflect the value of the derivative contracts to be settled in the future and do not take into consideration the value of the underlying commodity 
if the fair value of the derivative contract goes down  it means that the value of the commodity being hedged has gone up  and the net impact to our cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
conversely  if the fair value of the derivative contract goes up  it means the value of the commodity being hedged has gone down and again the net impact to our operating cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
costs and expenses lease operating expenses include third party transportation costs  gathering and compression fees  field personnel  and other customary charges 
lease operating expenses in appalachia also historically included a per well per month administrative charge pursuant to a management services agreement with vinland 
this fee was increased to per well per month beginning march  through december  pursuant to an agreement whereunder vinland has agreed to provide well tending services on vanguard owned wells under a turnkey pricing contract 
in addition  we historically have paid a per mcf and per mcf gathering and compression charge for production from wells drilled pre and post january   respectively  to vinland pursuant to a gathering and compression agreement with vinland 
this gathering and compression agreement was amended for the period beginning march  through december  to provide for a fee based upon the actual costs incurred by vinland to provide gathering and transportation services plus a per mcf margin 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  of which million related to the dos hermanos  sun tsh and ward county acquisitions 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to a lower unamortized cost of natural gas and oil properties as a result of the impairments of these properties recorded during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  offset by additional depletion recorded on natural gas and oil properties acquired in the sun tsh and ward county acquisitions 
an impairment of natural gas and oil properties in the amount of million was recognized during the year ended december  as the unamortized cost of natural gas and oil properties exceeded the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using the month average price of natural gas and oil  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
the impairment for the first quarter was million as a result of a decline in natural gas prices at the measurement date  march  this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  which became effective december   changed the price used to calculate oil and gas reserves to a month average price rather than a year end price 
as a result of declines in natural gas and oil prices based upon the month average price  we recorded an impairment of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment was calculated using the month average price for natural gas and oil of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the majority of the fourth quarter impairment was incurred on properties that we acquired in the last six months of when natural gas and oil prices were higher than the month average price 
we were able to lock in the higher prices at the time of the acquisitions for a substantial portion of the expected production through for natural gas and for crude oil by using commodity derivative contracts 
however  the impairment calculation did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as generally accepted accounting principles only allow the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our administrative employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  and these expenses included non cash charges of million and million  respectively  related to the grant of restricted class b units to officers and an employee and the grant of common units to board members during  and additionally  during the year ended december   these expenses included a charge for the fair value of phantom units granted to officers of million 
these phantom units were granted to two officers in amounts equal to of our units outstanding at january  and the amount paid in either cash or units will equal the appreciation in value of the units  if any  from the date of the grant until the determination date december   plus cash distributions paid on the units  less an hurdle rate 
there was no appreciation in the fair value of phantom units granted to officers during the year ended december  the remaining increase of million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is principally due to incremental costs associated with the company s growth and acquisitions 
production and other taxes include severance  ad valorem  and other taxes 
severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production and other taxes decreased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in severance taxes decreased million resulting from decreased natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil sales  texas margin tax decreased by million and ad valorem taxes increased by million primarily due to the taxes in appalachia being based on revenues 
interest expense declined to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average outstanding debt for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil sales increased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the key revenue measurements were as follows year ended december  percentage increase decrease net natural gas production appalachian gas mmcf permian gas mmcf n a south texas gas mmcf n a total natural gas production mmcf average appalachian daily gas production mcf day average permian daily gas production mcf day n a average south texas daily gas production mcf day n a average vanguard daily gas production mcf day average natural gas sales price per mcf net realized gas price  including hedges net realized gas price  excluding hedges net oil production appalachian oil bbls permian oil bbls n a total oil bbls average appalachian daily oil production bbls day average permian daily oil production bbls day n a average vanguard daily oil production bbls day average oil sales price per bbl net realized oil price  including hedges net realized oil price  excluding hedges net natural gas liquids production permian natural gas liquids gal n a south texas natural gas liquids gal n a total natural gas liquids production gal n a average permian daily natural gas liquids production gal day n a average south texas daily natural gas liquids production gal day n a average vanguard daily natural gas liquids production gal day n a average natural gas liquids sales price per gal net realized natural gas liquids price n a the permian acquisition closed on january  and  as such  only eleven months of operations are included in the year ended december  and were not included in the operations of the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the permian basin acquisition  based on the actual number of days from the acquisition closing date to the end of the reported period  was mcf day of natural gas  bbls day of oil and gal day of natural gas liquids during the dos hermanos acquisition closed on july  and  as such  only five months of operations are included in the year ended december  and were not included in the operations of the average daily production above is calculated based on the total number of days in the reported period regardless of how many days an acquisition contributed production in the reported period 
the average daily production for the dos hermanos acquisition  based on the actual number of days from the acquisition closing date to the end of the reported period  was  mcf day of natural gas and  gal day of natural gas liquids during excludes amortization of premiums paid and amortization of value on derivative contracts acquired 
the increase in natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil sales was due primarily to the impact of the permian basin acquisition completed on january   the dos hermanos acquisition completed on july  and increases in commodity prices during the first three quarters of production from the permian basin and dos hermanos acquisitions contributed million of natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil sales for the year ended december  in appalachia  a decline in natural gas production was partially offset by a increase in oil production for a net production decline of on an mcfe basis 
the increase in oil production was primarily due to a greater focus on the completion of oil zones as prices increased which conversely affected the amount of natural gas produced 
however  the negative impact of the natural gas production decline was offset by a increase in the average realized natural gas sales price received excluding hedges and a increase in the average realized oil price excluding hedges 
hedging and price risk management activities during the year ended december   the company recognized million in gains on commodity cash flow hedges 
these amounts relate to derivative contracts that the company entered into in order to mitigate commodity price exposure on a portion of our expected production and designated as cash flow hedges 
on november   the company concluded that since january  the contemporaneous formal documentation it had prepared to support its initial hedge designations and subsequent assessments for ineffectiveness in connection with the company s natural gas and oil hedging program in had not met the technical requirements to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with asc topic and it discontinued hedge accounting effective january  the gain on commodity cash flow hedges for the year ended december  relates to the amount that settled in and has been reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
during the year ended december   the company recognized a million realized loss on other commodity derivative contracts related to the settlements recognized during the period and a million gain related to the change in fair value of derivative contracts not meeting the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting 
the purpose of our hedging program is to mitigate the volatility in our operating cash flow 
depending on the type of derivative contract used  hedging generally achieves this by the counterparty paying us when commodity prices are below the hedged price and we pay the counterparty when commodity prices are above the hedged price 
in either case  the impact on our operating cash flow is approximately the same 
however  because the majority of our hedges are not designated as cash flow hedges  there can be a significant amount of volatility in our earnings when we record the change in the fair value of all of our derivative contracts 
as commodity prices fluctuate  the fair value of those contracts will fluctuate and the impact is reflected as a non cash  unrealized gain or loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
however  these fair value changes that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations only reflect the value of the derivative contracts to be settled in the future and do not take into consideration the value of the underlying commodity 
if the fair value of the derivative contract goes down  it means that the value of the commodity being hedged has gone up  and the net impact to our cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
conversely  if the fair value of the derivative contract goes up  it means the value of the commodity being hedged has gone down and again the net impact to our operating cash flow when the contract settles and the commodity is sold in the market will be approximately the same 
costs and expenses lease operating expenses include third party transportation costs  gathering and compression fees  field personnel  and other customary charges 
lease operating expenses in appalachia also included a per month per well administrative charge pursuant to a management services agreement with vinland  a per mcf and per mcf gathering and compression charge for production from wells drilled pre and post january   respectively  paid to vinland pursuant to a gathering and compression agreement with vinland 
lease operating expenses increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to the year months ended december  of which million related to the permian basin and dos hermanos acquisitions 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  due primarily to the additional depletion recorded on the oil and gas properties acquired in the permian basin and dos hermanos acquisitions 
an impairment of natural gas and oil properties in the amount of million was recognized during the year ended december  as the unamortized cost of natural gas and oil properties exceeded the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using period end prices  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties as a result of a decline in natural gas and oil prices at the measurement date 
the impairment calculation did not consider the positive impact of our commodity derivative positions as gaap only allows the inclusion of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our administrative employees and executive officers  related benefits  office leases  professional fees and other costs not directly associated with field operations 
these expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  for the years ended december  and these expenses included a million and million non cash compensation charge related to the grant of restricted class b units to officers and an employee  the grant of unit options to management  and the grant of common units to board members during and the remaining increase of million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is principally due to incremental costs associated with being a public company 
production and other taxes include severance  ad valorem  and other taxes 
severance taxes are a function of volumes and revenues generated from production 
ad valorem taxes vary by state county and are based on the value of our reserves 
production and other taxes increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in of which million related to the permian basin and dos hermanos acquisitions  and the remaining increase is attributable to higher severance taxes resulting from increased revenues in appalachia 
interest expense declined to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower interest rates which more than offset the higher average outstanding debt for the year ended december  all of our predecessor s outstanding debt was repaid with borrowings under our reserve based credit facility in january  including an early prepayment penalty of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
below  we have provided expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
please read note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
full cost method of accounting for natural gas and oil properties the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for gas and oil business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
there are several significant differences between these methods 
under the successful efforts method  costs such as geological and geophysical g g  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are expensed as incurred  where under the full cost method these types of charges would be capitalized to the full cost pool 
in the measurement of impairment of gas and oil properties  the successful efforts method of accounting follows the guidance provided in asc topic  property  plant and equipment  where the first measurement for impairment is to compare the net book value of the related asset to its undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the net book value full cost pool is compared to the future net cash flows discounted at using commodity prices based upon the month average price ceiling limitation 
if the full cost pool is in excess of the ceiling limitation  the excess amount is charged as an expense 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  we capitalize all acquisition  exploration and development costs for the purpose of finding natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil reserves  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly related to these finding activities 
for the years ended december  and  there were no internal costs capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of natural gas and oil properties are not recognized unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves 
our results of operations would have been different had we used the successful efforts method for our natural gas and oil investments 
generally  the application of the full cost method of accounting results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to similar companies applying the successful efforts method of accounting 
full cost ceiling test at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of natural gas and oil properties is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties using natural gas and oil price based upon the month average price  after giving effect to cash flow hedge positions  for which hedge accounting is applied  discounted at and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties ceiling test 
in and  our hedges were not considered cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and thus the value of our hedges were not considered in our ceiling test calculation 
prior to the effective date  december   of the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  present value of future net revenue from proved properties was calculated based on period end natural gas and oil prices 
the final rule requires that prices be based upon the month average price rather than a year end price to calculate the present value 
the calculation of the ceiling test and the provision for depletion and amortization are based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development as more fully discussed in natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil reserve quantities below 
due to the imprecision in estimating natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil reserves as well as the potential volatility in natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil prices and their effect on the carrying value of our proved natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil reserves  there can be no assurance that additional ceiling test write downs in the future will not be required as a result of factors that may negatively affect the present value of proved natural gas and oil properties 
these factors include declining natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil prices  downward revisions in estimated proved natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil reserve quantities and unsuccessful drilling activities 
we recorded a non cash ceiling test impairment of natural gas and oil properties for the year ended december  of million 
the impairment for the first quarter was million as a result of a decline in natural gas prices at the measurement date  march  this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  which became effective december   changed the price used to calculate oil and gas reserves to a month average price rather than a year end price 
as a result of declines in natural gas and oil prices based upon the month average price  we recorded an impairment of million in the fourth quarter of this impairment was calculated using the month average price for natural gas and oil of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
we recorded a non cash ceiling test impairment of natural gas and oil properties for the year ended december  of million as a result of a decline in natural gas and oil prices at the measurement date 
this impairment was calculated based on prices of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel of crude oil 
no ceiling test impairment was required during asset retirement obligation we have obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of a natural gas or oil well s life 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future plugging and abandonment costs requires management to make estimates and judgments inherent in the present value calculation of the future obligation 
these include ultimate plugging and abandonment costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  and timing of the obligation 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the natural gas and oil property balance 
natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil reserve quantities proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us 
we cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
in addition  the sec has not reviewed our or any reporting company s reserve estimates under the new rules and has released only limited interpretive guidance regarding reporting of reserve estimates under the new rules and may not issue further interpretive guidance on the new rules 
accordingly  while the estimates of our proved reserves at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new sec rules  those estimates could differ materially from any estimates we might prepare applying more specific sec interpretive guidance 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil are recognized when natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil have been delivered to a custody transfer point  persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the rights and responsibility of ownership pass to the purchaser upon delivery  collection of revenue from the sale is reasonably assured  and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
we sell natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil on a monthly basis 
virtually all of our contracts pricing provisions are tied to a market index  with certain adjustments based on  among other factors  whether a well delivers to a gathering or transmission line  quality of the natural gas or oil  and prevailing supply and demand conditions  so that the price of the natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil fluctuates to remain competitive with other available natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil supplies 
as a result  our revenues from the sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil will suffer if market prices decline and benefit if they increase without consideration of hedging 
we believe that the pricing provisions of our natural gas  natural gas liquids and oil contracts are customary in the industry 
the company has elected the entitlements method to account for gas production imbalances 
gas imbalances occur when we sell more or less than our entitled ownership percentage of total gas production 
any amount received in excess of our share is treated as a liability 
if we receive less than our entitled share the underproduction is recorded as a receivable 
we did not have any significant gas imbalance positions at december  or price risk management activities we periodically use derivative financial instruments to achieve a more predictable cash flow from our natural gas and oil production by reducing our exposure to price fluctuations 
currently  these derivative financial instruments include fixed price swaps and collars 
the derivative instruments we established in were designated as hedges under asc topic in connection with preparing its quarterly report for third quarter and discussion with bdo seidman  llp  the company s new independent registered public accounting firm  management of the company and the audit committee of its board of directors concluded that the contemporaneous formal documentation it had prepared to support its initial hedge designations and subsequent assessments for ineffectiveness in connection with the company s natural gas and oil hedging program in did not meet the technical requirements to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with asc topic the primary reasons for this determination were that the formal hedge documentation lacked specificity of the hedged cash flow and the quantitative subsequent assessments for ineffectiveness were insufficient 
therefore  the cash flow designations failed to meet hedge documentation requirements for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
in addition  the natural gas derivative swap contracts entered into in were de designated as cash flow hedges in the first quarter of due to an overhedged position in natural gas which made them ineffective 
under asc topic  the fair value of hedge contracts is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability  and the change in fair value of the hedge contracts are reflected in earnings 
if the hedge contracts qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the fair value of the hedge contract is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  and changes in the fair value do not affect net income until the contract is settled 
if the hedge contract does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  the change in the fair value of the hedge contract is reflected in earnings during the period as gain or loss on other commodity derivatives 
under the cash flow hedge accounting treatment used by the company in  the fair values of the hedge contracts were recognized in the consolidated balance sheets with the resulting unrealized gain or loss recorded initially in accumulated other comprehensive income and later reclassified through earnings when the hedged production affected earnings 
as a result of the determination that the documentation failed to meet cash flow hedge accounting treatment  the unrealized gain or loss on other commodity derivatives was recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of revenues in in addition  the net derivative loss at december  related to the de designated natural gas derivative contracts entered into in is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income until the month in which the transactions settle 
our predecessor did not specifically designate the derivative instruments established in as hedges under asc topic in january  we terminated existing hedges at a cost of approximately million  of which million is reflected as a realized loss on commodity cash flow hedges on the statement of operations for the year ended december  stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation pursuant to asc topic compensation stock compensation asc topic 
asc topic requires an entity to recognize the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees in the income statement 
it establishes fair value as the measurement objective in accounting for share based payment arrangements and requires all companies to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for generally all share based payment transactions with employees 
on march   the sec staff issued sab no 
 share based payment  to express the views of the staff regarding the interaction between asc topic and certain sec rules and regulations and to provide the staff s views regarding the valuation of share based payment arrangements for public companies 
in april  the sole member at that time reserved  restricted class b units in vnr for issuance to employees 
certain members of management were granted  restricted class b units in vnr in april  which vested two years from the date of grant 
in addition  another  restricted vnr class b units were issued in august to two other employees that were hired in april and may of  which will vest after three years 
the remaining  restricted class b units were not granted and are not expected to be granted in the future 
in october and february  four board members were granted  common units each of which vested after one year 
additionally  in october  two officers were granted options to purchase an aggregate of  units under our long term incentive plan with an exercise price equal to the initial public offering price of which vested immediately upon being granted and had a fair value of million on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value for these option awards was calculated in accordance with asc topic  by calculating the black scholes value of each option  using a volatility rate of  an expected dividend yield of and a discount rate of  and multiplying the black scholes value by the number of options awarded 
in determining a volatility rate of  the company  due to a lack of historical data regarding the company s common units  used the historical volatility of the citigroup mlp index over the day period prior to the date of grant 
furthermore  on january  and march   in accordance with their previously negotiated employment agreements  phantom units were granted to two officers in amounts equal to of our units outstanding at january  and the phantom units expired on december  and no liability or expense was recognized as there was no appreciation in the value of the units 
the amount in connection with the phantom units was paid in cash and in units at the election of the officers and is equal to the appreciation in value of the units from the date of the grant january  until the determination date december   plus cash distributions paid on the units  less an hurdle rate 
at december   an accrued liability and unit based compensation expense of million has been recognized in selling  general and administrative line item in the consolidated statement of operations  of which million is non cash compensation expense 
on january   four board members were granted  common units each which vested in january and on february   employees were granted a total of  units which vested in february in february  the company and vnrh entered into second amended and restated executive employment agreements the amended agreements with scott w  smith  our president and chief executive officer  and richard a 
robert  our executive vice president and chief financial officer 
the amended agreements provide for each executive to receive  restricted units granted pursuant to the vanguard natural resources  llc long term incentive plan the ltip  as well as an annual grant of  phantom units granted pursuant to the ltip 
the restricted units are subject to a vesting period of three years 
one third of the aggregate number of the units will vest on each one year anniversary of the date of grant so long as the executive remains continuously employed with the company 
the phantom units are also subject to a three year vesting period  although the vesting is not pro rata  but a one time event which shall occur on the three year anniversary of the date of grant so long as the executive remains continuously employed with the company during such time 
the phantom units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights  which entitle the executives to receive the value of any dividends made by the company on its units generally with respect to the number of phantom shares that executive received pursuant to this grant 
these common units  class b units  options and phantom units were granted as partial consideration for services to be performed under employment contracts and thus are subject to accounting for these grants under asc topic with respect to the restricted class b units granted to employees and the common units granted to directors and employees  we expect to incur million in non cash compensation expense for the year for the years ended december   and  we recorded million  million and million of non cash compensation expense  respectively 
recently adopted accounting pronouncements effective july   the fasb s asc became the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental gaap in the united states 
the historical gaap hierarchy was eliminated  and the asc became the only level of authoritative gaap  other than guidance issued by the sec 
our accounting policies were not affected by the conversion to asc 
however  references to specific accounting standards in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements have been changed to refer to the appropriate section of asc 
in september  the fasb issued guidance which defines fair value  establishes the framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this guidance is contained in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures asc topic 
in february  the fasb deferred the effective date applicable to us to january  for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis that is  at least annually 
on january   we adopted the provisions of asc topic  as it relates to financial assets and financial liabilities and we determined that the impact of the additional assumptions on fair value measurements did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we adopted the deferred provisions of asc topic on january   as it relates to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
