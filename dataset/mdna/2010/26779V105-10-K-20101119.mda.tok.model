licensure  certification and accreditation our healthcare facilities are subject to state and local licensing regulations ranging from the adequacy of medical care to compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws 
the failure to comply with these regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of a healthcare facility s license 
to assure continued compliance with these regulations  our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities 
moreover  in order to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs  each of our hospitals must comply with the applicable regulations of the united states department of health and human services dhhs relating to  among other things  equipment  personnel and standards of medical care  as well as comply with all applicable state and local laws and regulations 
if a hospital fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the medicare and medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts  the hospital s participation in the federal or state healthcare programs may be terminated  civil or criminal penalties may be imposed under certain provisions of the social security act  or both 
we believe that our hospitals are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal  state and local regulations and standards 
however  the requirements for licensure and certification are subject to change 
consequently  in order for our hospitals to remain licensed and certified  it may be necessary from time to time for us to make material changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel and or services 
professional licensure healthcare professionals at our facilities are required to be individually and currently licensed or certified under applicable state law and may be subject to numerous medicare and medicaid participation and reimbursement regulations 
we take steps to ensure that all independent physicians and our employees and agents have the necessary licenses and certifications with their respective licensing agency 
we believe that our employees and agents as well as all independent physicians on staff comply with all applicable state licensure laws 
the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act  collectively  the health care legislation the primary goal of the comprehensive health care legislation is to extend health coverage to approximately million uninsured legal us residents through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance reforms 
to fund the expansion of insurance coverage  the legislation contains measures designed to promote quality and cost efficiency in health care delivery and to generate budgetary savings in the medicare and medicaid programs 
we are unable to predict the full impact of the health care legislation at this time due to the law s complexity and current lack of implementing regulations or interpretive 
table of contents guidance 
however  we expect that several provisions of the health care legislation  including those described below  will have a material effect on our business 
public program reforms 
the health care legislation expands eligibility under existing medicaid programs to non pregnant adults with incomes up to of the federal poverty level beginning in further  the law permits states to create federally funded  non medicaid plans for low income residents not eligible for medicaid 
however  the health care legislation also contains a number of provisions designed to significantly reduce medicare and medicaid program spending  including negative adjustments to the annual market basket updates for medicare inpatient  outpatient  long term acute and inpatient rehabilitation prospective payment systems beginning immediately  as well as additional productivity adjustments beginning in  and reductions to medicare and medicaid dsh payments beginning in as the number of uninsured individuals declines 
in addition  the health care legislation contains a number of provisions intended to improve the quality and efficiency of medical care provided to medicare and medicaid beneficiaries 
for example  the legislation expands payment penalties based on a hospital s rates of hospital acquired conditions hacs 
currently  medicare no longer assigns an inpatient hospital discharge to a higher paying medicare severity adjusted diagnosis related group  if a selected hac was not present on admission 
effective july   the health care legislation will likewise prohibit the use of federal funds under the medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat hacs 
beginning in fiscal year  hospitals that fall into the top of national risk adjusted hac rates for all hospitals in the previous year will also receive a reduction in medicare payment rates 
for discharges occurring during a fiscal year beginning on or after october   hospitals with excessive readmissions for certain conditions will receive reduced medicare payments for all inpatient admissions 
separately  under a medicare value based purchasing program that will launch in fiscal year  hospitals that satisfy certain performance standards will receive increased payments for discharges during the following fiscal year 
these payments will be funded by decreases in payments to all hospitals for inpatient services 
for discharges occurring during fiscal year and after  the performance standards must assess hospital efficiency  including medicare spending per beneficiary 
in addition  the health care legislation directs centers for medicare and medicaid cms to launch a national pilot program to study the use of bundled payments to hospitals  physicians and post acute care providers relating to a single admission to promote collaboration and alignment on quality and efficiency improvement 
furthermore  the health care legislation contains provisions relating to recovery audit contractors racs  which are third party organizations under contract with cms that identify underpayments and overpayments under the medicare program and recoup any overpayments on behalf of the government 
the health care legislation expands the rac program s scope to include medicaid claims by requiring all states to enter into contracts with racs by december  health insurance market reforms 
the health care legislation contains provisions  which do not become effective until  requiring individuals to obtain  and employers to provide  insurance coverage 
in addition  the law requires states to establish a health insurance exchange 
the health care legislation also establishes a number of health insurance market reforms  including bans on lifetime limits and pre existing condition exclusions  new benefit mandates  and increased dependent coverage 
specifically  group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or individual coverage plans may not establish lifetime limits or  beginning january   annual limits on the dollar value of benefits  may not rescind coverage of an enrollee  except in instances where the individual has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or makes an intentional misrepresentation of material fact  must reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place  and effective for health plan policy years beginning on or after september  for plans that offer dependent coverage  continue to make dependent coverage available to unmarried dependents until age 
table of contents coverage for the dependents of unmarried adult children is not required 
other provisions 
medicare and medicaid anti kickback and anti fraud and abuse amendments codified under section b b of the social security act the anti kickback statute prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of health care services payable under the medicare and medicaid programs and other government programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid for by such programs 
the health care legislation now provides that knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required and also provides that submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the federal false claims act fca 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal and civil penalties  as well as fines and possible exclusion from government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
furthermore  the health care legislation expands the scope of the fca  which allows private individuals to bring qui tam or whistleblower actions on behalf of the government  alleging that a hospital or health care provider has defrauded a federal or state government program  such as medicare or medicaid 
if the government intervenes in the action and prevails  the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties for each false claim submitted to the government 
as part of the resolution of a qui tam case  the party filing the initial complaint may share in a portion of any settlement or judgment 
if the government does not intervene in the action  the qui tam plaintiff may continue to pursue the action independently 
there are many potential bases for liability under the fca 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the fca defines the term knowingly broadly 
though simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the fca  submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the fca and  therefore  will qualify for liability 
the fraud enforcement and recovery act of expanded the scope of the fca by  among other things  creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding repayment of an overpayment received from the government and broadening protections for whistleblowers 
under the health care legislation  the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due  whichever is later  constitutes a violation of the fca 
further  the health care legislation expands the scope of the fca to cover payments in connection with the new health insurance exchanges to be created by the legislation  if those payments include any federal funds 
the health care legislation also contains a number of other additional provisions  including provisions relating to the establishment of a center for medicare and medicaid innovation within cms  which will have the authority to develop and test new payment methodologies designed to improve the quality of care and lower costs  the creation of an independent payment advisory board that will make recommendations to congress regarding additional changes to provider payments and other aspects of the nation s health care system  and new taxes on manufacturers and distributors of pharmaceuticals and medical devices used by our hospitals  as well as a requirement that manufacturers file annual reports of payments made to physicians 
many of the law s provisions will not take effect for months or several years  while others are effective immediately 
many provisions also will require the federal government and individual state governments to interpret and implement the new requirements 
in addition  the health care legislation remains the subject of significant debate  and proposals to repeal  block or amend the law have been introduced in congress and many state legislatures 
finally  a number of state attorneys general have filed legal challenges to the health care legislation seeking to block its implementation on constitutional grounds 
because of the many variables involved  we are unable to predict the net effect on us of the reductions in medicare and medicaid spending  the expected increases in revenues from providing care to previously uninsured individuals  and numerous other provisions in the law that may affect us 
the health care legislation includes significant revisions to the portion of the social security act commonly known as the stark law  which generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of enumerated designated health services with whom the physician or a member of the 
table of contents physician s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement 
such referrals are deemed to be self referrals due to the physician s financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services 
an exception to the general self referral prohibition  commonly known as the whole hospital exception  previously existed under the stark law for physician ownership and or investment in an entire hospital rather than a subdivision of a hospital  provided that certain requirements were met 
under the health care legislation  the availability of the whole hospital exception will depend on physician ownership or investment in a new hospital facility and the existence of a provider agreement by december   provided certain other conditions are met 
the health care legislation also provides that the percentage of physician ownership or investment interests held in a hospital by physician owners or investors cannot exceed the percentage that existed as of march   the date on which the legislation was enacted 
the interplay of the dates under these two provisions of the health care legislation and other related matters creates uncertainty that has not yet been clarified by regulation or other interpretive guidance 
moreover  under the health care legislation  except in certain circumstances pursuant to an expansion exception process that has yet to be formally established  the number of operating rooms  procedure rooms and licensed beds in a hospital having physician ownership cannot be increased beyond the amount that existed on march  corporate practice of medicine and fee splitting some states  such as texas  have laws that prohibit unlicensed persons or business entities  including corporations  from employing physicians 
some states also have adopted laws that prohibit direct or indirect payments or fee splitting arrangements between physicians and unlicensed persons or business entities 
possible sanctions for violations of these restrictions include loss of license  civil and criminal penalties  and rescission of the business arrangements 
these laws vary from state to state  are often vague and in most states have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies 
we have structured our arrangements with healthcare providers to avoid the exercise of any responsibility on behalf of the physicians utilizing our hospitals that could be construed as affecting the practice of medicine and to comply with all such applicable state laws 
however  we cannot assure you that governmental officials charged with the responsibility for enforcing these laws will not assert that we  or the transactions in which we are involved  are in violation of these laws 
these laws also may be interpreted by courts in a manner inconsistent with our interpretations 
medicare reimbursement on july   cms issued the changes to the hospital inpatient prospective payment systems for acute care hospitals ipps and fiscal year rates final rule 
the final rule includes certain payment and policy changes effective for discharges on or after october   the beginning of the fiscal year 
these changes include various increases in medicare payments for hospitals reporting specified quality measure data  a decrease in the outlier threshold  and the addition of new quality measures to the reporting hospital quality data for annual payment update program 
additionally  on july   cms released the proposed changes to the hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps and calendar year payment rates opps proposed rule 
the opps proposed rule contains various proposed changes to medicare payment for outpatient procedures as well as the relaxation of the direct supervision requirement for certain nonsurgical extended duration therapy services sixteen procedure codes are proposed as services qualifying for the proposed policy change 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra on july   cms issued two final rules related to the adoption and dissemination of electronic health records ehrs 
one of the rules defines the meaningful use requirements that hospitals and other providers must meet to qualify for federal incentive payments for adopting ehrs under the arra 
the meaningful use final rule includes the following provisions a requirement that hospitals meet core objectives and select five objectives from a menu of optional objectives for demonstrating that they are meaningful users of ehrs  the remaining five optional objectives may be deferred until year two cms original proposal required hospitals to meet objectives  a requirement that hospitals meet clinical quality measures  instead of as originally proposed  
table of contents a postponement of the administrative simplification objectives for electronic claims submission and eligibility checks  and a limitation on the ability of states to tailor the federal meaningful use definition only as it pertains specifically to public health objectives and data registries 
the other final rule released on july  describes the technical capabilities required for certified ehr technology 
hospitals and other providers must adopt certified ehr technology  as well as demonstrate meaningful use to qualify for the federal incentive payments 
dodd frank act on july   president obama signed into law the restoring american financial stability act of the dodd frank act 
among other things  the dodd frank act establishes a new consumer financial protection agency cfpa within the federal reserve and authorizes the cfpa to promulgate regulations to promote transparency  simplicity  fairness  accountability and equal access in the market for consumer financial products or services  including debt collection services 
because the legislation gives significant discretion to the cfpa in establishing regulatory requirements and enforcement priorities  the extent to which our operations could be affected will not be known until the agency is established and begins issuing proposed regulations 
federal anti kickback statute the medicaid medicare anti kickback statute prohibits providers and others from soliciting  receiving  offering or paying  directly or indirectly  any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal healthcare program 
courts have interpreted this statute broadly 
a violation of the anti kickback statute constitutes a felony and may be punished by a criminal fine of up to  for each violation  imprisonment up to five years  or both  civil money penalties of up to  per violation and damages of up to three times the amount of the illegal kickback and or exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid 
the office of inspector general at the dhhs the oig  among other regulatory agencies  is responsible for identifying and eliminating fraud  abuse and waste in federal healthcare programs 
the oig carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits  investigations and inspections 
the oig has published final safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities that are deemed protected from prosecution under the anti kickback statute 
currently there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities  including the following investment interests  space rental  equipment rental  practitioner recruitment  personal services and management contracts  sale of practice  referral services  warranties  discounts  employees  group purchasing organizations  waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts  managed care arrangements  obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies  investments in group practices  freestanding surgery centers and referral agreements for specialty services 
compliance with a safe harbor is not mandatory 
the fact that a particular conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti kickback statute 
such conduct and business arrangements  however  may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities 
the determination as to compliance with the anti kickback statute outside of a safe harbor rests on the particular facts and circumstances and on the parties intent in entering into the transaction or arrangement 
the safe harbor regulations with respect to investment interests establish two instances in which payments to an investor in a venture will not be treated as a violation of the anti kickback statute 
the first safe harbor is for investment interests in public companies that have total assets exceeding million and whose investment securities are registered pursuant to the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
the second safe harbor or small entity safe harbor is for investments in entities when certain criteria are met 
two significant criteria for this safe harbor are that no more than of the value of the investment interests of each class of investments may be held in the previous fiscal year or previous twelve month period by investors who are in a position to make or influence referrals to  furnish items or services to  or otherwise generate business  for the entity  and that no more than of the gross revenue of the entity in the previous fiscal year or previous 
table of contents twelve month period may come from referrals or business otherwise generated from investors 
in addition to promulgating safe harbor regulations  to further assist providers  the oig has established a process to enable healthcare providers to request advisory opinions on whether individual transactions might violate the anti kickback and certain other statutes 
the oig also provides insight into its views on the application of the anti kickback statute through various documents including special fraud alerts  special advisory bulletins  medicare fraud alerts and medicare advisory bulletins 
we have a variety of financial relationships with physicians who refer patients to our hospitals 
physicians may own interests in certain of our hospitals and may also own our stock 
we also have medical directorship agreements with some physicians 
although we believe that our arrangements with physicians have been structured to comply with the current law and available interpretations  we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities will not determine that these arrangements violate the anti kickback statute or other applicable laws 
also  the state of texas  in which we operate  has adopted anti kickback laws  some of which apply more broadly to all payers  not just to federal healthcare programs 
many of these state laws do not have safe harbor regulations comparable to the federal anti kickback statute and have only rarely been interpreted by the courts or other government agencies 
if our arrangements were found to violate any of these anti kickback laws  we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and or possible exclusion from participating in medicare  medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs such as workers compensation programs 
exclusion from these programs could result in significant reductions in revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
stark law the federal physician self referral statute is commonly known as the stark law 
this law prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients who need designated health services dhs to entities with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship and prohibits the entities from billing medicare or medicaid for services ordered pursuant to a prohibited referral 
stark does  however  have a number of exceptions that permit financial relationships between physicians and entities providing dhs 
sanctions for violating the stark law include denial of payment  refunding amounts received for services provided pursuant to prohibited referrals  civil monetary penalties of up to  per prohibited service provided and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
the statute also provides for a penalty of up to  for a circumvention scheme that has the principal purpose of assuring referrals and that  if directly made  would violate the stark law 
the stark law now requires hospitals to submit annual reports containing a detailed description of the identity of each physician owner or investor and any other owners or investors of the hospital  and the nature and extent of all ownership and investment interests in the hospital 
it also requires hospitals to develop procedures requiring a referring physician owner or investor to disclose his or her ownership interest to the patient and  if applicable  the treating physician s ownership or investment interest  not condition any physician ownership or investment interests either directly or indirectly on the physician making or influencing referrals to the hospital or otherwise generating business for the hospital  and disclose on any public website for the hospital and in any public advertising that it is owned or invested in by physicians 
compliance with these three requirements must be achieved no later than september  cms proposed regulations giving guidance on complying with these requirements on august  when these regulations are final  we may need to make adjustments to our disclosure policies and procedures to comply 
as discussed in more detail above  one of the exceptions utilized to exempt hospital provided dhs from the ownership proscription is the whole hospital exception that was significantly revised by the health care legislation in a way that substantially impacts our business due to our partial physician ownership 
implementation of rules interpreting the revisions to this exception may have further effects 
the stark law may be amended in ways that we cannot predict at this time  including possible changes to the current physician ownership and compensation exceptions 
we cannot predict whether any other law or amendment will be enacted or the effect they might have on us 

table of contents state anti kickback and physician self referral laws many states  including those in which we do or expect to do business  have laws that prohibit payment of kickbacks or other remuneration in return for the referral of patients 
some of these laws apply only to services reimbursable under state medicaid programs 
however  a number of these laws apply to all healthcare services in the state  regardless of the source of payment for the service 
based on court and administrative interpretations of the federal anti kickback statute  we believe that the anti kickback statute prohibits payments only if they are intended to induce referrals 
however  the laws in most states regarding kickbacks have been subjected to more limited judicial and regulatory interpretation than federal law 
therefore  we can give you no assurances that our activities will be found to be in compliance with these laws 
noncompliance with these laws could subject us to penalties and sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on us 
a number of states  including those in which we do or expect to do business  have enacted physician self referral laws that are similar in purpose to the stark law but which impose different restrictions 
some states  for example  only prohibit referrals when the physician s financial relationship with a healthcare provider is based upon an investment interest 
other state laws apply only to a limited number of designated health services 
some states do not prohibit referrals  but require that a patient be informed of the financial relationship before the referral is made 
we believe that our operations are in material compliance with the physician self referral laws of the state of texas  in which our facilities are located 
other fraud and abuse provisions the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa broadened the scope of certain federal fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for healthcare fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs 
hipaa also added a prohibition against incentives intended to influence decisions by medicare beneficiaries as to the provider from which they will receive services 
in addition  hipaa created new enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse  including the medicare integrity program and an incentive program under which individuals can receive up to  for providing information on medicare fraud and abuse that lead to the recovery of at least of medicare funds 
hipaa was followed by the balanced budget act of  which created additional fraud and abuse provisions  including civil penalties for contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from a federal healthcare program 
the social security act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to medicare and medicaid programs 
false claims include  but are not limited to  billing for services not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement  billing for unnecessary goods and services  and cost report fraud 
criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for a number of other prohibited activities  including failure to return known overpayments  certain gainsharing arrangements  and offering remuneration to influence a medicare or medicaid beneficiary s selection of a healthcare provider 
like the anti kickback statute  these provisions are very broad 
careful and accurate coding of claims for reimbursement  as well as accurately preparing cost reports  must be performed to avoid liability 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws a factor affecting the healthcare industry today is the use of the fca and  in particular  actions brought by individuals on the government s behalf under the fca s qui tam  or whistleblower provisions 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
when a defendant is determined by a court of law to be liable under the fca  the defendant may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties of between  and  for each false claim submitted 
there are many potential bases for liability under the fca 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the fca defines the term knowingly broadly 
thus  although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the fca  submitting a claim with reckless disregard to its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the fca and  therefore  will qualify for liability 
effective may   the fraud enforcement and recovery act significantly amended the fca 
among the most significant changes  congress clarified and corrected certain 
table of contents provisions of the fca by legislatively overruling various court decisions that sought to interpret the scope of the fca 
other significant changes to the fca include an expansion of the definition of claim  increased liability for retaining overpayments from the government  and clarification of several provisions related to whistleblower actions 
the amendments extend the fca to instances of misuse of federal funds even when no false claim is presented to the government 
additionally  as discussed above  the health care legislation further expands the scope of the fca in many significant ways 
the effect of these changes is not yet clear 
in some cases  whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes  such as the anti kickback statute and the stark law  have thereby submitted false claims under the fca 
the state of texas  in which we operate  has adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court 
in its session  the texas legislature made numerous revisions to the state s laws which make it easier and potentially more profitable for a whistleblower to maintain a qui tam action 
the regulations governing reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs are very complex 
third party payers may also have complicated requirements that must be adhered to by healthcare providers 
these rules are not always clear and may be subject to interpretation 
it is necessary to ensure that claims submitted for reimbursement are accurately coded and completed 
failure to comply with these services and coding requirements can result in denials of payments or the recoupment of payments already received 
health information security and privacy practices the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require certain organizations  including us  to implement very significant business and operational systems designed to protect each patient s individual healthcare information 
among the standards that the dhhs adopted pursuant to hipaa are standards for the following electronic transactions and code sets  unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals  security and electronic signatures  privacy  and enforcement 
pursuant to hipaa  we are obligated to appoint or have appointed privacy and security officers  analyze our existing patient record confidentiality system  develop systems to meet the increased confidentiality requirements in the areas of both privacy and security  draft and implement policies and procedures to maintain those systems  train all relevant personnel in the policies and procedures  monitor the systems on an on going and continuous basis  notify every new and existing patient of our confidentiality practices and contract with certain vendors to assure they adhere to the same strict confidentiality and security standards 
the imposition of hipaa privacy  security and transactional code set standards on healthcare providers  among others  is a substantial step by the federal government toward requiring that individual health and medical records are developed  maintained and billed for in electronic format 
the rules continue to be amended and  as such  we will continue to modify our systems in order to maintain compliance with the standards 
in  the dhhs adopted final rules for the imposition  by the secretary of health and human services  of civil monetary penalties on entities that violate the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa 
the final rule amended the existing rules relating to the investigation of noncompliance to make them apply to all of the hipaa administrative simplification rules  rather than exclusively to the privacy standards 
it also amended the existing rules relating to the process for imposition of civil money penalties 
among other matters  the final rule clarified and elaborates upon the investigation process  bases for liability  determination of the penalty amount  grounds for waiver  conduct of the hearing and the appeal process 
the act also provides for criminal penalties for violations 
we have established a plan and committed the resources necessary to comply with hipaa 
at this time  we anticipate that we will be able to maintain compliance with hipaa regulations that have been issued 
based on the existing regulations and anticipated additions and amendments to the regulation  we believe that the cost of our compliance with hipaa will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents on february   the arra became law 
a portion of the law  known as the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act was aimed at increasing the use of ehrs by physicians and hospitals 
hospitals and physicians who are meaningful users of ehrs may receive higher reimbursement rates through the medicare and medicaid reimbursement systems 
other significant changes made by hitech include allowing state attorneys general to assist in the enforcement of hipaa and imposing the full hipaa liabilities of covered entities on business associates as well 
additionally  the hitech act puts in place numerous changes to patient access to their protected health information and their privacy rights 
currently  we are reviewing and will amend all of the hipaa policies and procedures in place at our two us hospitals to comply with the hitech changes 
the hitech act significantly increased penalties for violations of hipaa 
in the past  civil monetary penalties for hipaa violations had been limited to per violation  with a maximum of  for all violations of an identical requirement in a single year 
with the hitech act  fines start at per violation maximum  per year and go to  per violation  per year 
also  the act provides that hhs must develop a methodology by which victims of privacy violations may receive a share of penalties that are collected by the federal government 
finally  the act provides that state attorneys general may bring a civil action to enjoin privacy or security violations or obtain damages on behalf of state residents for such violations 
violations of the hipaa privacy standards can also result in tort liability claims  disciplinary proceedings  and even criminal prosecutions for deliberate disclosures that involve malicious intent or personal gain 
emergency medical treatment and labor act all of our hospitals are subject to the emergency medical treatment and labor act emtala 
this federal law requires any hospital that participates in the medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital s dedicated emergency department for treatment and  if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition  either to stabilize that condition or to make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can stabilize the condition 
the obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient s ability to pay for treatment 
cms has issued final regulations and interpretive guidelines clarifying various requirements under emtala 
there are severe penalties under emtala if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient s ability to pay 
penalties for violations of emtala include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare program 
in addition  an injured patient  the patient s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital 
although we believe that our emergency care practices are in compliance with emtala requirements  we cannot assure that cms or others will not assert that our facilities are in violation or predict any modifications that cms will implement in the future 
the ipps rule clarifies regulations with respect to waiver of emtala sanctions in an emergency period 
specifically  when permissible under section of the social security act  emtala sanctions are waived for an appropriate transfer if certain conditions are met  including the transfer being necessitated by the circumstances of the declared emergency and the hospital ensuring it does not discriminate on the basis of the individual s payment or ability to pay 
we cannot predict whether we will be in compliance with any new requirements or interpretive guidelines 
conversion legislation many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not for profit hospitals 
these laws  in general  include provisions relating to attorney general approval  advance notification and community involvement 
in addition  state attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise authority over these transactions based upon existing law 
in many states there has been an increased interest in the oversight of not for profit conversions 
we may effect a conversion of a not for profit hospital in the future and accordingly  the adoption of conversion legislation and the increased review of not for profit hospital conversions may increase the cost and difficulty or prevent our completion of transactions with not for profit organizations in certain states in the future 

table of contents certificate of need some states require state approval for construction and expansion of healthcare facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
certificates of need  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities  are sometimes required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services and certain other matters 
currently  we do not operate in any state that requires a certificate of need 
should we desire to expand our operations to any jurisdiction where a certificate of need will be required  we are unable to predict whether we will be able to obtain any such certificate of need 
environmental regulation our facilities operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
these operations also are subject to compliance with various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
we cannot predict whether the cost of such compliance will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position

if any of the matters described in the risk factors listed below were to occur  our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
the risk factors described below apply to the current operations and market for the common stock of the company  and do not address risks that may arise in the future 
risks related to our business because managing hospitals in china is new and differs from our experience in managing hospitals in the us  our efforts to obtain management contracts in that country may not be successful  and the management of the hospitals in rui an and any other hospitals we may manage may not be profitable 
we have invested a substantial amount of funds and management resources into the development of our china division 
there is no reliable history of foreign participation in the operation of hospitals in china on which to base our prospects for success 
our experience in managing hospitals in the us may not fully equip us to manage hospitals in china with different government regulation  reimbursement programs  physician relationships and billing systems 
specifically  the limitations placed by the department of health of each province on allowable charges by the province hospitals for medical prescriptions and procedures will limit our ability to increase revenues based on costs per prescription or procedure 
the agreement under which dynacq huai bei manages the second people s hospital in rui an provided for substantial investment of funds in capital expenditures for that hospital  the repayment of liabilities  and the loan of certain amounts to that hospital  which resulted in a net operating loss of approximately  in fiscal and million for the nine months during which it was subject to the management agreement in fiscal without the recruitment of new surgeons and a significant increase in patient volume  and or an increase in the local government s established allowable charges for the sale of prescription medications and medical services  dynacq huai bei s opportunity to realize profits from the management of second people s hospital  and possibly other hospitals in china  is limited 
although management agreements on additional hospitals may vary in their terms  there can be no assurances that additional management agreements will be undertaken or  if undertaken  that the terms of those agreements will allow the company to realize profits from the management arrangement 
we have no experience in any industry other than the operation of hospitals and medical office buildings  so the proposed expansion into other industries may involve unforeseen difficulties with which we are unable to deal effectively 
we are expanding our investments into areas other than the hospital industry in china that have a potential for higher profits 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities or acquire new businesses at a price and on terms that are attractive or that  once acquired  the businesses will operate profitably 
acquisitions could expose the company to unforeseen liabilities or risks associated with entering new markets or businesses 
consequently  we might not be successful in integrating our acquisitions into our existing operations  which may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or diminished financial performance or require a disproportionate amount of our management s attention and resources 
even if we are successful in integrating our acquisitions into our existing operations  we may not derive the benefits that we expect from such acquisitions  which may result in the commitment of capital resources without the anticipated returns on such capital 
competition for acquisition opportunities may escalate  increasing our cost of making further acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making additional acquisitions 
because of our lack of experience in these new industries  we may encounter issues with which we are not equipped to deal effectively and which may materially adversely affect our investments in those businesses 
we could owe the local government in china for apportionment of a portion of income in terms of the contract for second people s hospital 
the management agreement for the second people s hospital requires that of the drug income  and drug income in excess of of total sales  of the hospital be paid to the government 
this requirement was designed to control the cost of drugs by discouraging the sale by the hospital of drugs purchased from other than approved drug 
table of contents vendors 
however  the local government has not published a list of approved drug vendors and therefore has not enforced the payment provision since the inception of the original management agreement 
the company has been advised by a local attorney that enforcement of that provision is remote  so it has not accrued the amount that would be payable to the local government if this provision were enforced 
if the government were to enforce this provision  dynacq huai bei could potentially owe approximately million to the government for the period of time since inception of the original management contract on the hospital to august  our business could be adversely affected by foreign currency fluctuation 
because we received over of our revenue excluding discontinued operations within china in fiscal  and have total assets of approximately million which are denominated in currency other than the us dollar usd  we have foreign currency exchange risk 
the chinese currency rmb is not freely traded and is closely controlled by the chinese government 
the us dollar usd has experienced volatility in world markets recently 
during fiscal the rmb was basically unchanged against the usd 
during fiscal  fluctuation in the euro hong kong dollar and usd rmb exchange rate resulted in exchange losses of  which are included in rent and other income in our consolidated statements of operations 
the recent economic downturn may adversely affect our revenues 
the recent weakening in the united states economy  tightening credit markets  depressed consumer spending and higher unemployment rates may result in decreased spending for healthcare services resulting in decreased revenues for our hospitals 
other risks we face from the general economic weakness include potential declines in the population covered under managed care agreements  patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and non emergency healthcare procedures  potential increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations and further difficulties in our collecting patient copayment and deductible receivables 
our expansion into international operations could be harmed by economic  political  regulatory and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
the risks associated with international expansion could adversely affect our ability to expand our business 
expansion of our operations into new markets entails substantial working capital and capital requirements associated with complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  complexities related to obtaining agreements from foreign governments and third parties  foreign taxes  and financial risks  such as those related to foreign currency fluctuations 
international expansion will also be subject to general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic relationships 
in many market areas  other healthcare facilities and companies already have significant presence  the effect of which could be to make it more difficult for us to attract patients and recruit qualified physicians 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully manage the hospitals in rui an or other hospitals that we may enter into contracts to manage 
the failure to do so  including the failure to attract patients and to recruit qualified physicians to those facilities  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our investments in marketable securities in foreign markets are subject to a high degree of risk and differences in market conditions than those in the us we have significant unrealized gains on our investment in available for sale securities 
approximately of our assets are currently represented by foreign investment securities  which are generally less liquid  more volatile and harder to value than us securities 
these foreign investments are subject to unique risks such as currency risk  political  social and economic risk  and foreign market and trading risk 
foreign investments may be affected by political  social or economic events occurring in a country where the bonds are invested  which could cause the investments in that country to experience gains or losses 
lack of public information and uniform auditing  accounting and financial reporting standards in foreign countries make disclosure of investment information different from that available from domestic issuers 
the trading markets for these investments are significantly less active than us markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight 
because of these risks  and others  there can be no assurance that the company s investments in securities in foreign markets will retain or increase in value or can be liquidated at a price or time favorable to the company 

table of contents a significant percentage of our revenues are generated through relatively few physicians 
for the fiscal year ended august   approximately of our gross revenues of discontinued operations in the united states were generated from surgeons 
for the fiscal year ended august   approximately of our gross revenues of discontinued operations in the united states were generated from surgeons 
the loss of physicians who provide significant net patient revenues for the company may adversely affect our results of operations 
we are subject to substantial uninsured liabilities for which we have incurred  and may continue to incur  significant expenses 
in january  dynacq settled a class action lawsuit filed by shareholders against it and its directors and officers for allegedly publishing materially misleading financial statements  making materially false or misleading statements or omissions regarding its financial condition  and engaging in a fraudulent schedule to inflate the value of its stock 
this case  in addition to the legal actions alleging malpractice  product liability or related legal theories that are common in our industry  have involved significant costs and a major drain on management s time and resources 
although we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance coverage for our us facilities in amounts and with deductibles that we believe to be appropriate for our operations  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient or continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
our professional malpractice liability insurance has covered the majority of malpractice and related legal claims to date  however  the cost of defending the shareholder derivative suits and any damages awarded as a result of those suits  are paid by the company 
in addition  the large monetary claims and significant defense costs involved in many of the malpractice claims may exceed the limits of our insurance coverage 
if one or more successful claims against us were not covered by or exceeded the coverage of our insurance  we could be adversely affected 
we do not employ any of the physicians who conduct procedures at our hospitals  and the governing documents of each of our hospitals require physicians who conduct procedures at our hospitals to maintain stated amounts of insurance 
we indemnify our directors and officers against certain liabilities and do not presently carry director and officer liability insurance 
as permitted under nevada law and pursuant to our governing documents and indemnification agreements with certain of our officers and directors  we indemnify our directors against monetary damages for breach of a director s fiduciary duty  including advancing expenses  to the full extent permitted by nevada law 
as a result  shareholders rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty are limited 
we do not carry director and officer liability insurance  so our assets are at risk in the event of successful claims against us or our officers and directors 
our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy judgments against us and our officers and directors in the event of such successful claims 
in addition  our lack of director and officer liability insurance may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified directors and officers in the future 
we are dependent on the services of our chief executive officer and the head of our china division 
the company s future success  particularly in the development of its business in china  will depend upon its ability to retain the services of its chief executive officer and the head of the china division 
our chief executive officer s extensive experience and reputation in the healthcare industry in texas is essential to the success of our domestic operations  and his vision and contacts in china are essential to the success of our operations in that country 
the head of our china division has extensive experience in the healthcare industry as well as a network of contacts in industry and government in china  all of which are key to the development of our business in china 
the company does not have written employment agreements with either of these persons providing for specific terms of employment  and does not carry any key man life insurance 
the company s loss of either of these key personnel  especially if the loss is without advance notice  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we hold accounts with certain financial institutions that exceed the fdic and sipc insurance limits 
the company has financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk and consist primarily of cash investments and trade accounts receivable 
the company routinely maintains cash and temporary cash investments at certain financial institutions in amounts substantially in excess of federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and securities investor protection corporation sipc insurance limits 
in hong kong  the entire deposit amounts are protected by the deposit protection scheme and  up to the end of  a guarantee provided by the hong kong sar government s exchange fund 
at august   the company had cash balances in excess of the fdic and sipc limits of million 
the management believes that these financial institutions are of high quality and the risk of loss is minimal 
however  we could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations if any of these financial institutions were to fail and we were unable to recover our cash balances 
risks associated with our industry the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act  collectively  the health care legislation may have a significant impact on our existing and future joint ventures 
the health care legislation includes significant revisions to the portion of the social security act commonly known as the stark law  which generally prohibits physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of enumerated designated health services with whom the physician or a member of the physician s immediate family has an ownership interest or compensation arrangement 
such referrals are deemed to be self referrals due to the physician s financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services 
an exception to the general self referral prohibition  commonly known as the whole hospital exception  previously existed under the stark law for physician ownership and or investment in an entire hospital rather than a subdivision of a hospital  provided that certain requirements were met 
under the health care legislation  the availability of the whole hospital exception will depend on physician ownership or investment in a new hospital entity and the existence of a provider agreement by december   provided certain other conditions are met 
the health care legislation also provides that the percentage of physician ownership or investment interests held in a new hospital entity by physician owners or investors cannot exceed the percentage that existed as of march   the date on which the legislation was enacted 
the interplay of the dates under these two provisions of the health care legislation and other related matters creates uncertainty that has not yet been clarified by regulation or other interpretive guidance 
moreover  under the health care legislation  except in certain circumstances pursuant to an expansion exception process that has yet to be formally established  the number of operating rooms  procedure rooms and licensed beds in a hospital having physician ownership cannot be increased beyond the amount that existed on march  the provisions of the health care legislation that are described herein  as well as other provisions therein and future interpretations  rulings and guidance  could have a significant impact on our existing and future joint ventures 
if we fail to comply with the extensive laws and complex government regulations applicable to us  we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 
our operations in china are also subject to environmental laws  rules and regulations regarding medical waste  medical radioactive agents and pollution 
additionally our operations in china are subject to government regulation of the healthcare industry 
the violation of any of these laws  rules or regulations could result in fines and other penalties that could adversely affect the successful operation of our hospitals 
the us healthcare industry is highly regulated and must comply with extensive government regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
hospitals must meet requirements for licensure  certification to participate in government programs and accreditation 
in addition  there are regulatory requirements related to areas such as adequacy and quality of medical care  relationships with physicians and other referral sources anti kickback statute and stark law  for example  qualifications of medical and support personnel  billing for services  confidentiality of medical records  emergency care and compliance with building codes 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these extensive government laws and regulations  if we fail to comply with any of the laws or regulations we could be subject to criminal penalties and civil sanctions  and our facilities could lose their licenses 
table of contents and their ability to participate in federal and state healthcare programs 
in addition  government laws and regulations  or the interpretation of such laws and regulations  may change 
in that case  we may have to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services or business structures so that our facilities may remain licensed and qualified to participate in federal and state programs 
if the rules governing reimbursement are revised or interpreted in a different manner or if a determination is made that we did not comply with these requirements  we could be subject to denials of payment or recoupment of payments already received for services provided to patients 
specifically  the federal anti kickback statute and the stark law are very broad in scope  and many of their provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted 
see business government regulation for an in depth description of those statutes 
if the ownership distributions paid to physicians by our hospitals are found to constitute prohibited payments made to physicians under the anti kickback statute  physician self referral or other fraud and abuse laws  our business may be adversely affected 
other companies within the healthcare industry continue to be the subject of federal and state investigations that could increase the risk that we may become subject to similar investigations in the future 
if laws governing the corporate practice of medicine change  we may be required to restructure some of our relationships 
the laws of various states in which we operate or may operate in the future do not or may not permit business corporations to practice medicine  exercise control over physicians who practice medicine or engage in various business practices  such as fee splitting with physicians 
the interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state 
a government agency charged with enforcement of these laws  or a private party  might assert that our arrangements with physicians and physician group practices do not comply with applicable corporate practice of medicine laws 
if our arrangements with these physicians and physician group practices were deemed to violate state corporate practice of medicine  fee splitting or similar laws  or if new laws were enacted rendering these arrangements illegal  we may be required to restructure our relationships with physicians and physician groups  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes to the fee guidelines for texas workers compensation cases have resulted in lower reimbursement and may result in a decrease in the number of those type of procedures performed 
the texas workers compensation acute care hospital outpatient and inpatient facility fee guidelines which became effective march  establish reimbursement amounts for workers compensation procedures performed at our facilities 
those amounts are determined by applying the most recently adopted and effective medicare reimbursement formula and factors as published annually in the federal register  including identifying the appropriate ambulatory payment classification for outpatient services provided  or diagnosis related group for inpatient services provided 
the applicable classification or group is used to determine the maximum allowable reimbursement for the procedures performed unless not calculable using guidelines  in which case reimbursement will be determined on a fair and reasonable basis 
based on these new guidelines  the reimbursement due the company for workers compensation cases is lower than we previously experienced 
our net patient service revenues attributable to texas workers compensation cases as a percentage of gross billings have decreased and may continue to decrease as a result of lower reimbursement rates for workers compensation procedures still being performed 
our revenues may not increase due to a reduction in payments from third party payers  a shift in the surgical mix  government cost controls and or other circumstances over which we have no control 
in china  the local government department of health establishes billing rates for a hospital s sale of prescription medication and medical services  thereby limiting the amounts second people s hospital may charge for those medications and services 
services provided under the local government s social healthcare insurance program  which constitute a small part of the revenues of second people s hospital  are generally paid at approximately of billed charges in two to three months after the date of service 
the remaining of billed charges is evaluated by the local government department of health on a semi annual basis and may be paid to the hospital after that evaluation is complete 

table of contents we are dependent upon private and governmental third party sources of payment for the services provided to patients in our healthcare facilities 
the amount of payment our facilities receive for their services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control  including federal and state regulations and the cost containment and utilization decisions of third party payers 
the company s decision to participate in certain managed care contracts may not result in an increase in patient revenues if we are unable to obtain favorable managed care contracts  we are excluded from participation in a managed care contract  or the reimbursement rate for the procedure performed is too low 
further  complicated reimbursement rules that are subject to interpretation may subject us to denials of payment for services provided or to recoupments of payments already received 
we have no control over the number of patients that are referred to our facilities annually or whether such patients will be admitted as inpatients that typically have a higher reimbursement rate per procedure  or outpatients 
fixed fee schedules  capitation payment arrangements  exclusion from participation in managed care programs or other factors affecting payments for healthcare services over which we do not have control could also cause a reduction in our revenues 
we are dependent upon the good reputation of our physicians 
the success of our business is dependent upon quality medical services being rendered by our physicians 
any negative publicity  whether from civil litigation  allegations of criminal misconduct  or forfeiture of medical licenses  with respect to any of our physicians and or our facilities could adversely affect our results of operations 
this could occur through the loss of a physician who provides significant revenue to the company  or decisions by patients to use different physicians or facilities with respect to their healthcare needs 
several years ago dynacq was the subject of negative publicity in news reports focusing on its pasadena facility  which harmed its business and reputation 
as the patient physician relationship involves inherent trust and confidence  any negative publicity adversely affecting the reputation of our physicians or our facilities would likely adversely affect our results of operations 
our hospitals face competition for patients from other hospitals and healthcare providers 
although most hospitals in china are owned and operated by the local governments subject to the oversight by the central government  there currently exist joint venture arrangements between foreign healthcare providers and government owned hospitals  principally in major cities such as shanghai and beijing 
some of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than the company in china 
the second people s hospital in the city of rui an is subject to significant competition from the first people s hospital which is a much larger hospital located in the downtown area offering specialty surgeries not currently available at the hospital we manage 
the healthcare business is highly competitive  and competition among hospitals and other healthcare providers for patients has intensified in recent years 
generally  other hospitals in the local communities served by most of our us hospitals provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals 
in addition  the number of freestanding specialty hospitals and surgery and diagnostic centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly 
as a result  most of our hospitals operate in an increasingly competitive environment 
some of the hospitals that compete with our hospitals are owned by governmental agencies or not for profit corporations supported by endowments and charitable contributions and can finance capital expenditures and operations on a tax exempt basis 
increasingly  we are facing competition by physician owned freestanding surgery centers that compete for market share in high margin services and for quality physicians and personnel 
if our competitors are better able to attract patients  recruit physicians  expand services or obtain favorable managed care contracts at their healthcare facilities  we may experience a decline in patient volume 
our hospitals face competition for staffing  which may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability 
our operations are dependent on the effort  abilities and experience of the management and medical support personnel  such as nurses  pharmacists and lab technicians  as well as our physicians 
we compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and medical support personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of our hospitals 
in the us market  the availability of nurses and other medical 
table of contents support personnel has become a significant operating issue to healthcare providers 
this shortage may require us to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
if our labor costs increase  we may not be able to raise rates to offset these increased costs 
our failure to recruit and retain qualified management  nurses and other medical support personnel  or to control our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
market risks related to our stock a single stockholder controls a majority of our outstanding shares 
our chairman and chief executive officer  mr 
chiu chan  beneficially owns an aggregate of approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock as of august  as a majority stockholder  he is able to control all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election and removal of any directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  he is in a position to control the management of our business and the appointment of executive officers as well as all management personnel 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control  or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
mr 
chiu chan s interests may conflict with those of other stockholders 
in the event that he elects to sell significant amounts of shares of common stock in the future  such sales could depress the market price of our common stock  further increasing the volatility of our trading market 
our common stock has a limited trading market  which could affect your ability to sell shares of our common stock and the price you may receive for our common stock 
our common stock is currently quoted on the nasdaq global markets 
there is only limited trading activity in our securities 
we have a relatively small public float compared to the number of our shares outstanding 
accordingly  we cannot predict the extent to which investors interest in our common stock will provide an active and liquid trading market 
due to our limited public float  we may be vulnerable to investors taking a short position in our common stock  which would likely have a depressing effect on the price of our common stock and add increased volatility to our trading market 
furthermore  we have been  and in the future may be subject to  class action lawsuits that further increase market volatility 
the volatility of the market for our common stock could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
accordingly  investors must be able to bear the financial risk of losing their entire investment in our common stock 
future issuance of additional shares of our stock could cause dilution of ownership interests and adversely affect our stock price 
in addition to approximately million shares of common stock we have that are authorized to issue but are unissued  our board may issue up to million shares of preferred stock which may have greater rights than our common stock  without seeking approval from holders of our common stock 
in addition  we are obligated to issue an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock upon the exercise of options outstanding under our incentive plan 
none of these options have an exercise price which is lower than the market price at august  the shares that could be issued upon exercise of the outstanding options represent approximately of our currently outstanding shares of common stock 
additional shares are subject to options not yet granted under the plan  and we may grant additional options or warrants in the future to purchase shares of our common stock not under the plan 
the exercise price of each option granted under our option plan is equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant  although that price may be substantially less than the value per share on the date of exercise 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
it has been our policy to use all available funds from operations to improve and expand our current facilities and to acquire new facilities 
for that reason  we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no present intention to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
therefore an investor in our common stock should not expect to obtain any economic benefit from owning our common stock prior to a sale of those shares  if then

our management s discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed in item a risk factors 
our operating results for all periods presented reflect operations of our pasadena and garland facilities as discontinued operations 
in august  the board of directors of the company approved a plan to dispose of these two facilities 
however  the facilities continue to be operated by the company until such time as they are sold 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to the management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes these accounting policies involve judgment due to the significant assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
management believes it has exercised proper judgment in determining these estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to it at the time the estimates were made 
the significant accounting policies are described in the company s financial statements see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
of these policies  management believes the following ones may involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition revenue recognition policy in china  the local government department of health establishes billing rates for a hospital s sale of prescription medication and medical services 
a majority of the services provided by second people s hospital is to cash pay patients  who pay for the services in advance 
for services provided under the local government s social healthcare insurance program  we are generally paid at approximately of billed charges two to three months after the date of service 
the remaining of billed charges is evaluated by the local government department of health on a semi annual basis and may be paid to the hospital after that evaluation is complete 
the company had bad debt expenses of  and  for the years ended august  and  respectively  related to denials under the social healthcare insurance program  which is less than of the revenues of the china division 
since the amount of bad debt expense is minimal  it has been included with other operating expenses in the income statement 
accounts receivable accounts receivable represent net receivables for services provided by the company 
at each balance sheet date management reviews the accounts receivable for collectibility 
discontinued operations background the company s revenue recognition policy is significant because net patient service revenue is a primary component of its results of operations 
revenue is recognized as services are delivered 
the determination of the amount of revenue to recognize in connection with the company s services is subject to significant judgments and estimates  which are discussed below 
revenue recognition policy the company has established billing rates for its medical services which it bills as gross revenue as services are delivered 
gross billed revenues are then reduced by the company s estimate of the discount contractual allowance to arrive at net patient service revenues 
net patient service revenues may not represent amounts ultimately collected 
the company does adjust current period revenue for actual differences in estimated revenue recorded in prior periods and actual cash collections 

table of contents the table below sets forth the percentage of our gross patient service revenue by financial class for the fiscal years and workers compensation commercial medicare medicaid self pay other contractual allowance the company computes its contractual allowance based on the estimated collections on its gross billed charges 
the company computes its estimate by taking into account collections received  up to days after the end of the period  for the services performed and also estimating amounts collectible for the services performed within the last six months 
the following table shows gross revenues and contractual allowances for fiscal years and gross billed charges contractual allowance net revenue contractual allowance percentage a significant amount of our net revenue results from texas workers compensation claims  which are governed by the rules and regulations of the tdwc and the workers compensation healthcare networks 
if one of our hospitals chooses to participate in a network  the amount of revenue that will be generated from workers compensation claims will be governed by the network contract 
for claims arising prior to the implementation of workers compensation networks and out of network claims  inpatient and outpatient surgical services are either reimbursed pursuant to the acute care in patient hospital fee guideline or at a fair and reasonable rate for services in which the fee guideline is not applicable 
starting march   the texas workers compensation acute care hospital outpatient and inpatient facility fee guidelines the guidelines became effective 
under these guidelines  the reimbursement amounts are determined by applying the most recently adopted and effective medicare reimbursement formula and factors  however  if the maximum allowable reimbursement for the procedure performed cannot be calculated using these guidelines  then reimbursement is determined on a fair and reasonable basis 
based on these new guidelines  the reimbursement due the company for workers compensation cases is lower than we previously experienced 
the company has continued accepting texas workers compensation cases  and has not made any substantial changes in its focus towards such cases 
our net patient service revenue for texas workers compensation cases as a percentage of gross billings has decreased primarily as a result of lower reimbursement rates for workers compensation procedures still being performed 
should we disagree with the amount of reimbursement provided by a third party payer  we are required to pursue the mdr process at the tdwc to request proper reimbursement for services 
from january to november  the company had been successful in its pursuit of collections regarding the stop loss cases pending before the state office of administrative hearings soah  receiving positive rulings in over of its claims presented for administrative determination 
the district court decision upholding our interpretation of the statute as applied to the stop loss claims was appealed by certain insurance carriers  and on november  the third court of appeals determined that in order for a hospital to be reimbursed at of its usual and customary audited charges for an inpatient admission  the hospital must not only bill at least  but also show that the admission involved unusually costly and unusually extensive services 
procedurally  the decision means that each case where a carrier raised an issue regarding whether the services provided were unusually costly or unusually extensive would be remanded to either soah or mdr for a case by case determination of whether the services 
table of contents provided meet these standards  once the definitions of those standards are determined 
as a result of the third court of appeals opinion  any stop loss cases pending at soah have been remanded to the tdwc since these cases have not been reviewed or decided by the two prong standard decided by the third court of appeals 
the soah administrative law judges determined that the most appropriate location for these cases is the tdwc  pending a final  non appealable decision 
a petition asking the texas supreme court to review the third court of appeals decision was initially denied by the texas supreme court 
a motion for rehearing of denial of petition for review has been filed and is pending 
the texas supreme court s decision regarding the third court of appeals opinion is currently pending  and final adjudication in these pending stop loss cases will depend on the uncertain outcome of a very lengthy process 
we anticipate further  lengthy litigation at the travis county district courts and the texas courts of appeals 
because of this lengthy process and the uncertainty of recovery in these cases  collection of a material amount of funds in these pending stop loss cases is not anticipated during the fiscal year 
through august  insurance carriers have voluntarily paid the awards in the decisions and orders issued by soah  plus interest  in approximately cases  involving approximately million in claims 
in most of these cases  the carriers have requested refunds of the payments made in the event that the soah decisions and orders are reversed on appeal 
we believe the likelihood that the company will be obligated to refund the payments is remote 
our request that the tdwc commissioner enforce the awards which have not been voluntarily paid by the carriers has been refused in approximately cases 
claims regarding payment for hospital outpatient services remain pending at the tdwc 
it is expected that these claims will be adjudicated at soah and ultimately in the texas district and appellate courts 
the basis for reimbursement for these services made the subject of these pending cases is the determination of fair and reasonable charges 
in  we received unfavorable rulings from soah in all of our appeals of unfavorable decisions related to services provided in and the cases  which have been appealed to the travis county district courts  challenge the constitutionality of the relevant statutory language 
the company received an unfavorable ruling in its lead case in march  which ruling has been appealed to and was upheld by the third court of appeals on august  the texas third court of appeals has denied the company s request for rehearing  and the company will appeal to the texas supreme court 
this ruling will impact cases in which a fee guideline was not applicable  specifically all pending cases involving ambulatory surgical services provided in and as well as all pending cases involving hospital outpatient services provided prior to march   when the guidelines took effect 
probability of collection in these cases is marginal and depends on the rulings of the texas supreme court 
we are currently pursuing claims against two healthcare agents relating to contracts with certain of our facilities which set out reimbursement guidelines by several workers compensation carriers at a minimum of of the facility s charges 
discovery is continuing on these claims to determine which carriers are involved  the amount of reimbursement due to us  and the data used to determine usual and customary market rates for medical services in specific geographic regions 
due to the uncertainties regarding the accounts receivable in the mdr process  the and third court of appeals opinions and our legal counsel s advice that settlements with insurance carriers have virtually stopped  the company had fully reserved all accounts receivable related to the mdr process as of august  any monies collected for these mdr accounts receivable will be recorded as current period s net patient service revenues 
accounts receivable accounts receivable represent net receivables for services provided by the company 
at each balance sheet date management reviews the accounts receivable for collectibility 
the contractual allowance stated as a percentage of gross receivables at the balance sheet dates is larger than the contractual allowance percentage used to reduce gross billed charges due to the application of partial cash collections to the outstanding gross receivable balances  without any adjustment being made to the contractual 
table of contents allowance 
the contractual allowance amounts netted against gross receivables are not adjusted until such time as the final collections on an individual receivable are recognized 
sources of revenue and reimbursement the focal point of our business is providing patient care services  including complex orthopedic and bariatric procedures 
the company pursues optimal reimbursement from third party payers for these services 
we do not normally participate in managed care or other contractual reimbursement agreements  principally because they limit reimbursement for the medical services provided 
this business model often results in increased amounts of reimbursement for the same or similar procedure  as compared to other healthcare providers 
however  there are no contractual or administrative requirements for prompt payment of claims by third party payers within a specified time frame 
as a result  the company has tended to receive higher amounts of per procedure reimbursement than that which may be received by other healthcare providers performing similar services 
conversely  despite the increased reimbursement  we may take additional time to collect the expected reimbursement from third party payers 
the company has been participating in managed care contracts since the first quarter of fiscal and anticipates entering into additional contracts in the future 
so far these contracts have not resulted in any meaningful patient revenues 
increased participation in managed care contracts and programs may decrease the per procedure reimbursement that the company collects in the future for similar services 
in addition to the fact that our collection process may be longer than other healthcare providers because of our focus on workers compensation and other commercial payers  the collection process can be extended due to our efforts to obtain all optimal reimbursement available to the company 
specifically  for medical services provided to injured workers  the company may initially receive reimbursement that may not be within the fee guidelines or regulatory guidelines mandating reimbursement 
for such cases in which third party payers did not provide appropriate reimbursement pursuant to these guidelines  the company pursues further reimbursement 
the company reviews and pursues those particular claims that are determined to warrant additional reimbursement pursuant to the fee or regulatory guidelines 
the company s pursuit of additional reimbursement amounts that it believes are due under fee or regulatory guidelines may be accomplished through established dispute resolution procedures with applicable regulatory authorities 
surgeries are typically not scheduled unless they are pre authorized by the insurance carrier for medical necessity  with the exception of medicare  medicaid and self pay surgeries 
after the surgery  the company s automated computer system generates a statement of billed charges to the third party payer 
at that time  the company also requests payment from patients for any remaining amounts that are the responsibility of the patient 
in cases where a commercial insurance payers pre approval is not approved subsequently  those accounts receivable may be classified to self pay 
historically  such classifications have not been significant 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations and many of these estimates of future operations may be imprecise 
changes in state  federal  and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
in addition  we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties 
these factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
our estimates and judgments associated with our calculations of income taxes have been reasonable in the past  however  the possibility for changes in the tax laws  as well as the current economic uncertainty  could affect the accuracy of our income tax estimates in future periods 

table of contents stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under asc topic we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is based on an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and an option s expected life 
the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments
