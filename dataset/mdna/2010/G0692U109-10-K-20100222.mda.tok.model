table of contents our business strategy our long term business strategy focuses on utilizing our management s extensive expertise  experience and long standing market relationships to identify and underwrite attractively priced risks while delivering insurance and reinsurance solutions to our customers 
our underwriters worldwide are focused on constructing a portfolio of risks that effectively utilizes our capital while optimizing the risk reward characteristics of the portfolio 
we exercise disciplined underwriting practices and manage a diverse book of business while seeking to maximize our profitability and generate superior returns on equity 
to afford ourselves ample opportunity to construct a portfolio diversified by product and geography that meets our profitability and return objectives  we have implemented organic growth strategies in key markets worldwide 
the markets in which we operate have historically been cyclical 
during periods of excess underwriting capacity  as defined by availability of capital  competition can result in lower pricing and less favorable policy terms and conditions for insurers and reinsurers 
during periods of reduced underwriting capacity  pricing and policy terms and conditions are generally more favorable for insurers and reinsurers 
historically  underwriting capacity has been impacted by several factors  including industry losses  catastrophes  changes in legal and regulatory guidelines  investment results and the ratings and financial strength of competitors 
our near term strategies conform to our long term objectives but also reflect changes and opportunities within the global marketplace 
the following is an overview of the insurance and reinsurance market since our first full year of operations in  together with a discussion as to how we have evolved during this period 
the following table shows gross premiums written in each of our segments over the last five years year ended december  insurance reinsurance total we were established in late to take advantage of the significant imbalance that had been created between the demand for insurance and reinsurance and the supply of capacity from adequately capitalized insurers and reinsurers 
pricing and deductibles were increasing dramatically and policy terms and coverages tightening across many specialist lines of business 
in a short period of time following our formation  we were able to assemble a diverse portfolio of specialist insurance risks 
we also established a property reinsurance portfolio largely comprising worldwide catastrophe exposure 
since our inception  we have focused our efforts on identifying and recruiting talented specialist underwriters and diligently building our infrastructure to access and analyze risks for our global portfolio and to deliver service of the highest quality to our clients 
during  we were able to further diversify our global business by adding select underwriting teams and infrastructure in the us and in europe 
specifically  we established a meaningful presence in the wholesale insurance market in the us  which allowed us to quickly take advantage of favorable market conditions 
we also entered the professional lines insurance business through a renewal rights transaction and simultaneous recruitment of an underwriting team from kemper 
the shortage of capacity for us professional lines reinsurance business served as an opportunity for further diversification of our global treaty reinsurance business and establishment of a local presence in the us reinsurance marketplace 
by the end of  we had also established a local presence in the continental european reinsurance marketplace  allowing us to diversify into 
table of contents other traditional european treaty reinsurance business including motor liability and credit and bond 
the establishment and growth of our us and european reinsurance underwriting operations contributed to significant premium growth in our reinsurance segment during and since these early years of substantial growth  we have continued to establish our position in the global insurance and reinsurance marketplace 
this has been against the backdrop of a softening market cycle throughout many of our property and liability lines of business  with increased competition  surplus underwriting capacity and deteriorating rates  terms and conditions all having an impact on our ability to write business 
despite this  our strong diversity by product and geography  has allowed us to effectively reallocate underwriting capacity around our business operations as we see market conditions change and business opportunities arise  allowing us to maintain a relatively stable level of gross premiums written during this period 
within our reinsurance segment  although market conditions have not been particularly conducive to premium growth in recent years  including a trend of greater risk and retention appetite in the industry  conditions have generally been better than the primary market which has provided us with an opportunity to achieve greater market penetration in the us and european reinsurance markets over this period 
further  market conditions improved across several lines of business during  which  along with specific growth opportunities  allowed us to expand the segment this year 
within our insurance segment  market conditions have been increasingly competitive for several years  with surplus capacity and price deterioration prevalent across most of our portfolio 
as a result we have reduced our participation in certain business in recent years 
the impact of this has been partially offset by specific growth opportunities 
this has included the expansion of our professional lines business  both through the purchase of the media pro business in as well as new business opportunities arising during and in the aftermath of the financial market crisis 
in recent years  we have also added underwriting expertise to our credit and political risk team and established a branch in singapore  which has provided us with access to a broader range of distribution channels 
this has allowed us to provide more products which are not as closely correlated to the property and liability cycle  in particular  emerging market sovereign and corporate credit 
our ability and appetite to write this business  however  was negatively impacted in the latter part of and throughout by the effects of the global financial crisis 
in  we established a new global accident and health line of business within our insurance segment  which effective january  provides corporate personal accident and business travel coverage as well as specialty and catastrophe health and ancillary property and casualty coverage 
we intend to initially grow this business in the us market and expand into the european  canadian  australian and asian markets over time 
during  we created a new ceded reinsurance unit to coordinate our reinsurance purchasing activities  improve efficiency and consistency and take advantage of new opportunities in the marketplace 
in recent years  we have expanded our reinsurance coverage  particularly for professional lines and casualty insurance business 
this strategy has allowed us to reduce our overall net retentions relative to previous years and therefore deliver more value through an improvement in our risk reward position 
our use of technology allows us to maintain a low cost infrastructure and efficient underwriting operations 
in addition  we believe our technological capabilities provide us with competitive advantages as we seek to improve our relationships with our customers  provide enhanced levels of customer service and optimize our internal decision making process 
during  we implemented additional levels of back up across our core processing systems  communication networks and databases to mitigate the disruption to fundamental business processing 
we also expanded our usability of remote application technologies ie  remote access  web applications  video conferencing and geographically dispersed data synchronization to meet the demands of a more mobile and dispersed workforce 

table of contents we continue to strengthen our enterprise risk management framework  having created a separate risk management department during we value the strategic significance of an effective risk management structure  particularly in today s complex environment 
our erm practices are currently evaluated as strong by standard poor s s p 
segment information our underwriting operations are organized around our two global underwriting platforms  axis insurance and axis re and therefore we have determined that we have two reportable segments  insurance and reinsurance 
except for goodwill and intangible assets  we do not allocate our assets by segment as we evaluate the underwriting results of each segment separately from the results of our investment portfolio 
financial data relating to our segments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements presented under item and in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under item insurance segment lines of business and distribution our insurance segment offers specialty insurance products to a variety of niche markets on a worldwide basis 
the following are the lines of business in our insurance segment property provides physical loss or damage  business interruption and machinery breakdown coverage for virtually all types of property  including commercial buildings  residential premises  construction projects and onshore energy installations 
this line of business consists of both primary and excess risks  some of which are catastrophe exposed 
marine provides coverage for traditional marine classes  including offshore energy  cargo  liability  recreational marine  fine art  specie  hull and war 
offshore energy coverages include physical damage  business interruption  operators extra expense and liability coverage for all aspects of offshore upstream energy  from exploration and construction through the operation and distribution phases

coverage is provided for a range of risks including sovereign default  credit default  political violence  currency inconvertibility and non transfer  expropriation  aircraft non repossession and contract frustration due to political events 
the credit insurance coverage is primarily for lenders seeking to mitigate the risk of non payment from their borrowers in emerging markets 
for the credit insurance contracts  it is necessary for the buyer of the insurance most often a bank to hold an insured asset most often an underlying loan in order to claim compensation under the insurance contract 
the traditional political risk coverage provides protection against sovereign actions that result in the impairment of cross border investments for banks and major corporations known as cend coverages 

table of contents professional lines provides coverage for directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability  employment practices liability  fiduciary liability  crime  professional indemnity and other financial insurance related coverages for commercial enterprises  financial institutions and not for profit organizations 
this business is predominantly written on a claims made basis 
liability primarily targets primary and low mid level excess and umbrella commercial liability risks in the us excess and surplus lines markets 
target industry sectors include construction  manufacturing  transportation and trucking and other services 
other primarily consists of employee medical coverage for self insured  small and medium sized employers  for losses in excess of a given retention 
we produce business primarily through wholesale and retail brokers worldwide 
some of our insurance products are also distributed through managing general agents and underwriters 
in the us  we have the ability to write business on an admitted basis using forms and rates as filed with state insurance regulators and on a non admitted basis  or surplus lines basis  with flexibility in forms and rates as these are not filed with state regulators 
having non admitted carriers in our us group of companies provides the pricing flexibility needed to write non standard coverage 
substantially all of our insurance business is written subject to aggregate limits  in addition to event limits 
gross premiums written by broker  shown individually where premiums are or more of the total in any of the last three years  were as follows year ended december  marsh aon willis other brokers managing general agencies and underwriters total no major customer accounted for more than of the gross premiums written in the insurance segment 
competitive environment we operate in highly competitive markets 
in our insurance segment  where competition is focused on price as well as availability  service and other considerations  we compete with us based companies with global insurance operations  as well as non us global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets 
we believe we achieve a competitive advantage through a strong capital position and the strategic and operational linking of our practices  which allows us to design insurance programs on a global basis in alignment with the global needs of many of our clients 

table of contents reinsurance segment lines of business and distribution our reinsurance segment operates through offices based in bermuda  new york  zurich and singapore 
we focus on writing business on an excess of loss basis  where possible  whereby we typically provide an indemnification to the reinsured entity for a portion of losses both individually and in the aggregate  on policies in excess of a specified individual or aggregate loss deductible 
for business written on a proportional basis  we receive an agreed percentage of the premium and are liable for the same percentage of incurred losses 
reinsurance may be written on a portfolio treaty basis or on an individual risk facultative basis 
the majority of our business is written on a treaty basis and primarily offered to us by reinsurance brokers worldwide 
our reinsurance segment provides non life reinsurance to insurance companies on a worldwide basis 
the following are the lines of business in our reinsurance segment catastrophe provides protection for most catastrophic losses that are covered in the underlying insurance policies written by our cedants 
the exposure in the underlying policies is principally property exposure but also covers other exposures including workers compensation  personal accident and life 
the principal perils in this portfolio are hurricane and windstorm  earthquake  flood  tornado  hail and fire 
in some instances  terrorism may be a covered peril or the only peril 
we underwrite catastrophe reinsurance principally on an excess of loss basis 
property includes reinsurance written on both a proportional and a per risk excess of loss basis and covers underlying personal lines and commercial property exposures 
here the primary reason for the product is not simply to protect against catastrophic perils  however they are normally included with limitations 
professional liability covers directors and officers liability  employment practices liability  medical malpractice  lawyers and accountants liability  environmental liability and miscellaneous errors and omissions insurance risks 
the underlying business is predominantly written on a claims made basis 
business is written on both a proportional and excess of loss basis 
credit and bond consists of reinsurance of trade credit insurance products and includes both proportional and excess of loss structures 
the underlying insurance indemnifies sellers of goods and services in the event of a payment default by the buyer of those goods and services 
also included in this line of business is coverage for losses arising from a broad array of surety bonds issued by bond insurers principally to satisfy regulatory demands in a variety of jurisdictions around the world 
motor provides coverage to cedants for motor liability and  to a lesser degree  property damage losses arising out of any one occurrence 
the occurrence can involve one or many claimants where the ceding insurer aggregates the claims from the occurrence 
liability provides coverage to insurers of standard casualty business  excess and surplus casualty business and specialty casualty programs 
the primary focus of the underlying business is general liability  although workers compensation and auto liability are also written 
engineering provides coverage for all types of construction risks and risks associated with erection  testing and commissioning of machinery and plants during the construction stage 
this line of business also includes coverage for losses arising from operational failures of machinery  plant and equipment and electronic equipment as well as business interruption 
other includes aviation  marine  personal accident and crop reinsurance 

table of contents gross premiums written by broker  shown individually where premiums are or more of the total in any of the last three years  were as follows year ended december  aon marsh willis other brokers direct total no major customer accounted for more than of the gross premiums written in the reinsurance segment 
competitive environment in our reinsurance segment where competition tends to be focused on availability  service  financial strength and increasingly price  we compete with major us and us reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi line insurance organizations 
we believe we achieve a competitive advantage through our strong capital position as well as our technical expertise that allows us to respond quickly to customer needs and provide quality and innovative underwriting solutions 
in addition  our customers highly value our exemplary service  strong capitalization and financial strength ratings 
reinsurance protection our ceded reinsurance unit coordinates the purchase of treaty and facultative reinsurance to reduce our exposure to large losses or a series of large losses 
all treaty reinsurance purchases and our facultative reinsurance strategies are pre approved by our reinsurance purchasing group  which consists of senior management 
facultative reinsurance provides for all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single policy and each policy reinsured is individually negotiated 
treaty reinsurance provides for a specified type or category of risks 
our reinsurance agreements may be on an excess of loss or proportional basis 
excess of loss covers provide a contractually set amount of cover after an excess point has been reached 
this excess point can be based on the size of an industry loss or a fixed monetary amount 
these covers can be purchased on a package policy basis  which provide cover for a number of lines of business within one contract 
proportional covers provide a proportional amount of coverage from the first dollar of loss 
all of these reinsurance covers provide for recovery of a portion of losses and loss expenses from reinsurers 
we remain liable for the original claim to the extent that reinsurers do not meet their obligations under these agreements 

table of contents reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses we establish reserves for losses and loss expenses that arise from our insurance and reinsurance products 
these reserves are balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of future amounts required to pay losses and loss expenses for insured or reinsured claims that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date  whether already known or not yet reported 
our loss reserves are established based upon our estimate of the total cost of claims that were reported to us but not yet paid case reserves  and the anticipated cost of claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr 
the table below shows the development of our loss reserves since inception 
to illustrate an understanding of the information in this table  following is an example using reserves established at december  the top lines of the table show for successive balance sheet dates the gross and net unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at or prior to each balance sheet date 
it can be seen that at december   a reserve of  million  net of reinsurance had been established 
the lower part of the table presents the net amounts paid as of periods subsequent to the balance sheet date 
hence in the year ended december   net payments of million were made from the december  reserve balance 
by the end of  cumulative net payments against the december  net reserves were  million 
the upper part of the table shows the revised estimate of the net liabilities originally recorded as of the end of subsequent years 
with the benefit of actual loss emergence over the intervening period  the net liabilities incurred as of december   are now estimated to be  million  rather than the original estimate of  million 
of the cumulative redundancy of million recognized in the four years since december   million was identified and recorded in  million in  million in and million in importantly  the cumulative deficiency or redundancy for different balance sheet dates is not independent and therefore  should not be added together 
in  we have revised our estimate of the december   liabilities from  million to  million 
this favorable development of million will also be included in each column to the right of december   to recognize that there was also reserve redundancy in the reserves established at december   and 
table of contents year ended december  gross reserve for losses and loss expenses reinsurance recoverable net losses and loss expenses reserve net reserves reestimated as of year later years later years later years later years later years later years later years later cumulative redundancy cumulative net paid losses year later years later years later years later years later years later years later years later impact of unrealized foreign exchange movements gross reserve for losses and loss expenses re estimated reinsurance recoverable net losses and loss expenses reserve re estimated cumulative redundancy on gross reserve the table above also shows the impact of foreign exchange rate movements 
movements in foreign exchange rates between periods result in variations in our net loss reserves  as the us dollar  our reporting currency  strengthens or weakens against underlying currencies 
for example  for the year ended december   the weakening of the us dollar  primarily against the euro and sterling  resulted in an million increase in our net loss reserves  established prior to  or during  we generally hold investments in the same currency as our net reserves  with the intent of matching the impact of foreign exchange movements on our assets and liabilities 
conditions and trends that affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it may be inappropriate to anticipate future redundancies or deficiencies based on historical experience 
the key issues and considerations involved in establishing our estimate of our loss reserves is discussed in more detail within the critical accounting estimates reserve for losses and loss expenses section of item for additional information regarding the key underlying movements in our loss reserves in the last three years  refer to the group underwriting results loss ratio section of item 
table of contents cash and investments we seek to balance the investment portfolios objectives of increasing book value with the generation of stable investment income  while providing sufficient liquidity to meet our claims and other obligations 
liquidity needs arising from potential claims are of primary importance and are considered in asset class participation and the asset allocation process 
intermediate maturity investment grade fixed income securities have duration characteristics similar to our expected claim payouts and are therefore central to our investment portfolio s asset allocation 
at december   the duration of our fixed maturities portfolio was years  which approximates the estimated duration of our net insurance liabilities 
to optimize the growth in our book value  we may invest in other asset classes such as equity securities  high yield securities and alternative investments eg hedge funds which provide higher potential total rates of return 
such investments involve varying degrees of risk  including the potential for more volatile returns and reduced liquidity 
with regard to our investment portfolio  we utilize third party investment managers for security selection and trade execution functions  subject to our guidelines and objectives for each asset class 
this enables us to actively manage our investment portfolio with access to top talents specializing in various products and markets 
we select the managers based on various criteria including investment style  track record  performance and corporate governance 
additionally  we monitor approved investment asset classes for each subsidiary through analysis of our operating environment  including expected volatility of cash flows  overall capital position  regulatory and rating agency considerations 
the finance committee of our board of directors approves our overall group asset allocation targets and investment policy and guidelines to ensure that they are consistent with our overall goals  strategies and objectives 
we also have an investment committee  comprising senior management  which oversees the implementation of our investment strategy

table of contents enterprise risk management overview enterprise risk management erm erm is our group wide framework for identifying  managing  reporting and responding to risks that could affect the achievement of our strategic and financial objectives 
the objectives of our erm framework are to protect our capital base by monitoring the most efficient deployment of capital monitor risk taking within the company against our risk taking appetite  enhance value creation and contribute to an optimal risk return profile  and support our group wide decision making process by providing reliable and timely risk information 
risk landscape within our erm framework  we distinguish between the following sources of risk insurance the inherent uncertainty as to the occurrence  amount and timing of insurance liabilities transferred to us through the underwriting process 
credit the risk of incurring financial loss due to diminished creditworthiness of our counterparties 
investment risk of potential losses in our investment portfolio as a result of market risks  as well as risk inherent in individual securities 
operational risks associated with our people  processes and systems  including external events 
funding and liquidity the risk that we are unable to meet our short term financial obligations or raise funds to finance our commitments at an affordable cost 
for further review of our liquidity and capital management refer to the liquidity and capital resources section of item risk governance the risk committee of our board of directors board oversees  on the basis of proposals from management  the creation of a framework for the management of risk 
the framework  ultimately approved by the board  includes our risk management methodologies  standards  tolerances  and risk strategies 
our risk committee also assesses whether management is addressing risk issues in a timely and appropriate manner 

table of contents our risk management committee  comprising our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief risk officer and senior management from both our insurance and reinsurance segments and operations  is responsible for maintaining our risk standards as well as monitoring aggregations  risk tolerances and emerging risks 
the risk management committee acts as an interface between our risk committee and management  who are responsible for managing our business within defined risk tolerances 
our risk management department oversees risk taking activities throughout the group  providing guidance and support for risk management practices 
the risk management department is also responsible for assessing the combined impact of all risks and reporting on the group s risk position by class of risk  segment of business  legal entity and group 
our risk governance structure is complemented by our internal audit department 
internal audit is an independent  objective assurance function that assesses the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal control systems 
internal audit also coordinates risk based audits and compliance reviews and other specific initiatives to evaluate and address risk within targeted areas of our business 
our risk management philosophy  framework and practices have provided us with stability during volatile times and we continuously seek to refine and update our approach 
regular  clear and open communication has helped us to build a consistent risk management culture across our diverse organization 
risk appetite our basis for accepting risk is determined by our risk appetite  as approved by our board 
our risk appetite is a function of our capital  profitability and stakeholder expectations of the types of risk we hold within our business 
the risk committee regularly reviews our risk profile to ensure alignment with our risk appetite 
our risk appetite primarily reflects our tolerance for risk from our overall underwriting portfolio  including individual events natural peril or non natural peril catastrophes  and from our investment portfolio 
in addition  we specifically focus on the relationship between combinations of different risks to assess the potential for reduction in our profitability and capital base 
ensuring that our capital is sufficient to take advantage of market opportunities even in stressed market conditions is of key importance 
an element of our erm framework is our economic capital model 
utilizing this modeling framework provides us with a holistic view of the capital we put at risk in any year by allowing us to understand the relative interaction between all of the risks impacting us 
this integrated approach recognizes that a single risk factor can affect different sub portfolios and that different risk factors can have different mutual dependencies 
the economic capital model is used to support  inform and improve decision making across the group 
the model is regularly updated to reflect changes in our business and the external environment 
recognizing that in extreme scenarios  many risks may interact to cause an impairment of our capital  our board requires that the enterprise risk within our business is managed to preserve capital under such stress conditions 
our board also recognizes that financial strength ratings are a key element of our competitive positioning and our ability to raise further capital 
we actively manage and monitor our available capital against the capital required to operate at our targeted financial strength rating 
we also review our available capital  both at a group and individual legal entity level  against the evolving capital requirements of the risk based regulatory regimes to which we are subject 

table of contents managing insurance risks overview since our inception in  we have expanded our international underwriting presence  with offices in bermuda  the us  europe  singapore  canada and australia 
our disciplined underwriting approach coupled with an extensive group wide peer review process has enabled us to manage this growth in a controlled and consistent manner 
this  coupled with our focus on maintaining high levels of experience in our underwriting teams  has ensured that our risk profile aligns closely with our defined risk appetite 
we emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share 
a critical element of our management of insurance risk is our rigorous peer review process which allows us to monitor market conditions and aggregations risk by risk  at the highest levels within the company 
another key component of our mitigation of insurance risk is the purchase of reinsurance 
the business that we accept is not always fully retained  but instead portions may be reinsured 
we have a centralized reinsurance purchasing group which coordinates our reinsurance purchasing as part of our overall risk management strategy 
modeling natural peril catastrophes natural peril catastrophic risk is our largest aggregate exposure 
in managing this risk  we are concerned with both the loss of capital due to a single event and the loss of capital that would occur from multiple but perhaps small events in any year 
natural catastrophes such as earthquakes  storms and floods represent a challenge for risk management due to their accumulation potential and occurrence volatility 
we use multiple commercial vendor models to price and accumulate risks 
these models cover the major peril regions where we face potential exposure 
in our reinsurance segment  we have also developed an internal proprietary application which allows us to track the results from various models for both pricing and aggregation purposes 
modeling allows us to simulate many hypothetical loss scenarios to supplement our experienced underwriting judgment 
we centrally oversee our modeling for consistency in approach and form a global perspective on our group wide accumulations 
we impose limits on natural peril catastrophe risk exposure at the group level 
based on our current tolerance  we are not willing to lose more than of our prior year end capital for a modeled single occurrence in year return period probable maximum net loss 
we also impose limits on probable maximum losses in any one zone from a single event 
a zone is a geographical area in which insurance risks are considered to be correlated to a single catastrophe event 
our executive management receives regular reports on our group wide total natural peril exposures by peril and territory to ensure active monitoring of our risk positions 

table of contents the table below shows our loss exposures to peak natural peril catastrophe territories 
we have developed these loss estimates using vendor models and our own assessments for non vendor modeled exposures 
these estimates include assumptions regarding the location  size and magnitude of an event  the frequency of events  the construction type and damageability of property in a zone  and the cost of rebuilding property in a zone 
in millions of us dollars zone perils year return period year return period year return period us hurricane  california earthquake europe windstorm japan earthquake japan windstorm the following table provides our estimate of industry losses for the corresponding scenarios above in billions of us dollars zone perils year return period year return period year return period us hurricane california earthquake europe windstorm japan earthquake japan windstorm the return period refers to the frequency with which losses of a given amount or greater are expected to occur 
the figures take into account the fact that an event may trigger claims in a number of lines of business 
for instance  our us hurricane modeling includes  among other things  the estimated pre tax impact to our financial results arising from our catastrophe  property  engineering  energy  marine and aviation lines of business 
as indicated in the table above  our modeled single occurrence in year return period us hurricane probable maximum loss  net of reinsurance  is approximately million or of shareholders equity at december  
according to our modeling  there is a one percent chance that our losses incurred in any single us hurricane event could be in excess of million 
conversely  there is a chance that the loss from a us hurricane will fall below million 
we estimate that  an event that gave rise to such hypothetical loss levels  at this return period  would cause industry losses of approximately billion  resulting in an estimated market share of insured losses for us of 

table of contents managing risks from man made catastrophes similar to our management of natural peril catastrophe exposures  we also take a similar focused and analytical approach to our management of man made catastrophes 
man made catastrophes  which include such risks as train collisions  airplane crashes  hotel fires or terrorism  are harder to model in terms of assumptions regarding intensity and frequency 
for these risks we couple the vendor models where available with our bespoke modeling and underwriting judgment and expertise 
this allows us to take advantage of business opportunities relating to man made catastrophe exposures particularly where we can measure and limit the risk sufficiently as well as obtain risk adequate pricing 
as an example of our approach  our assessment of terrorism risk is based on a mixture of qualitative and quantitative data eg for estimating property damage  business interruption  mortality and morbidity subsequent to an attack of a predefined magnitude  which we use to control  limit and manage our aggregate terrorism exposure 
we use vendor modeling and bespoke modeling tools to measure accumulations around potential terrorism accumulation zones on a deterministic and probabilistic basis 
we supplement the results of our modeling with underwriting judgment 
managing reserving risk our prudent reserving process demands data quality and reliability and requires a quantitative and qualitative review of both our overall reserves and individual large claims 
within a structured control framework  real time claims information is communicated on a regular basis throughout our organization  including to senior management  to provide an increased awareness regarding the losses that have taken place throughout the insurance markets 
the detailed and analytical reserving approach that follows is designed to absorb and understand the latest information on our reported and unreported claims  to recognize the resultant exposure as quickly as possible  no matter how large  and above all else  to make appropriate and realistic provisions in our financial statements 
reserving for long tail lines of business  and in particular liability business  represents the most significant reserving risk for us 
when loss trends prove to be higher than those underlying our reserving assumptions  the risk is greater because of a stacking up effect for liability business  we carry reserves to cover claims arising from several years of underwriting activity and these reserves are likely to be adversely affected by unfavorable loss trends 
we manage and mitigate reserving risk on liability business in a variety of ways 
first  we limit the amount of liability business we write in line with maintaining a well balanced and diversified global portfolio of business 
in  net premiums written on liability business represented less than of our consolidated total 
we purchase extensive reinsurance on liability business in our insurance segment to reduce our net positions 
additionally  our underwriters and actuaries follow a disciplined underwriting process that utilizes all available data and information  including industry trends 
our underwriting guidelines within each business stipulate detailed pricing information required from clients  including historical premium development  historical loss experience  targeted loss ratio and exposure rate information 
our underwriters and pricing actuaries supplement this with data purchased externally 
in our reinsurance segment  we also conduct an extensive program of cedant underwriting and claims audits which allow us to better inform our underwriting and reserving decisions 
we employ contract wording specialists  who  along with our legal department and underwriters  are involved in contract wording reviews 
these reviews help us clarify contract wording and reflect the understanding of our underwriters 
these reviews are particularly important when new clauses or changes in clauses are proposed 
we have established prudent reserving policies for determining carried reserves 
these policies are systemic and we endeavor to apply them consistently over time 

table of contents managing claims handling risk in accepting risk  we are committing to the payment of claims and therefore these risks must be understood and controlled 
we have claims teams located throughout our main operating locations 
our claim teams include a diverse group of experienced professionals  including claims adjusters and attorneys 
we also use approved external service providers  such as independent adjusters and appraisers  surveyors  accountants  investigators and specialist attorneys  as appropriate 
we maintain claims handling guidelines and claims reporting control and escalation procedures in all our claims units 
to ensure that claims are handled and reported in accordance with these guidelines  all large claims matters are reviewed during weekly claims meetings 
the minutes from each meeting also are circulated to our underwriters  senior management and others involved in the reserving process 
to maintain communication between underwriting and claims teams  claims personnel regularly report at underwriting meetings and frequently attend client meetings 
when we receive notice of a claim  regardless of size  it is recorded within our underwriting and claims system 
to assist with the reporting of significant claims  we have also developed a large claims information database  or lcid 
the database is primarily used to produce flash reports for significant events and potential insurance or reinsurance losses  regardless of whether we have exposure 
the system allows a direct notification to be promptly communicated to underwriters and senior management worldwide 
similarly  for natural peril catastrophes  we have developed a catastrophe database that allows for the gathering  blending and reporting of loss information as it develops from early modeled results to fully adjusted and paid losses 
managing credit risks credit risk represents the risk of incurring financial loss due to diminished creditworthiness eroding credit rating and  ultimately  default among our third party counterparties  related to  but not limited to  cash and cash equivalents  investments  premium receivables  unpaid reinsurance recoverable balances and derivatives 
additionally  we have credit risk exposure within our underwriting portfolios 
our most significant exposures to credit risk are discussed further below 
we monitor and control the aggregation of credit risk on a group wide basis by assigning limits on maximum credit exposures by single obligors and groups  industry sector  country  region or other inter dependencies 
limits are based on a variety of factors including the prevailing economic environment and the nature of the underlying credit exposures 
the credit risk reporting process is supported by our group credit risk exposure database  which contains relevant information on counterparty details and credit risk exposures 
it is accessible by all key practitioners in the group  thus providing essential transparency to allow for the implementation of active exposure management strategies 
we also license third party databases to provide a real time view of credit exposures 
credit risk relating to our fixed maturities with our fixed maturity investment portfolio  which represents billion  or of our total assets  we are exposed to potential losses arising from the diminished creditworthiness of issuers of bonds as well as third party counterparties such as custodians 
we limit such credit risk through diversification and issuer exposure limitation graded by ratings 
specifically  we manage our credit exposure by limiting the purchase of fixed maturities to investment grade securities 
in addition  excluding us government and agency securities  we limit our concentration of credit risk to any single corporate issuer to or less of our fixed maturities portfolio for securities rated a or above and or less of our fixed maturities portfolio for securities rated between bbb and bbb 

table of contents credit risk relating to reinsurance recoverable assets within our reinsurance purchasing activities  we are exposed to the credit risk of a reinsurer failing to meet its obligations under our reinsurance contracts 
to help mitigate this  all of our reinsurance purchasing is subject to financial security requirements specified by our reinsurance security committee 
this committee  comprising senior management personnel  maintains a list of approved reinsurers  performs credit risk assessments for existing and potential counterparties  recommends counterparty tolerance levels for different types of ceded business and monitors concentrations of credit risk 
this assessment considers a whole range of individual attributes  including a thorough review of the counterparty s financial strength  industry position and other qualitative factors 
we regularly monitor counterparty credit quality and exposures  with special monitoring of those cases that merit close attention 
it is generally our reinsurance security committee s policy to require reinsurers which do not meet our counterparty security requirements to provide adequate collateral 
we further mitigate credit risk by diversifying our exposure by counterparty 
credit risk relating to our underwriting portfolio in our insurance segment  we provide credit insurance primarily for lenders financial institutions seeking to mitigate the risk of non payment from their borrowers in emerging markets 
this product has complemented our more traditional political risk insurance business in recent years 
for the credit insurance contracts  it is necessary for the buyer of the insurance  most often a bank  to hold an insured asset  most often an underlying loan  in order to claim compensation under the insurance contract 
the vast majority of the credit insurance provided is for single name illiquid risks  primarily in the form of senior secured bank loans that can be individually analyzed and underwritten 
as part of this underwriting process  our rigorous evaluation of credit worthiness and reputation of the obligor is critical and forms the cornerstone of the underwriting process 
we prefer that our clients retain a significant share of each transaction that we insure 
a key element to our underwriting analysis is the assessment of recovery in the event of default and  accordingly  the strength of the collateral and the enforceability of rights to the collateral are paramount 
we avoid insurance for structured finance products defined by pools of risks and insurance for synthetic products that would expose us to mark to market losses 
we also seek to avoid terms in our credit insurance contracts which introduce liquidity risk  most notably  in the form of a collateralization requirement upon a ratings downgrade 
we also provide protection against sovereign default or sovereign actions that result in impairment of cross border investments for banks and corporations 
our contracts generally include warranties  representations  exclusions and waiting periods 
under most of our policies  a loss payment is made in the event the debtor failed to pay our client when payment is due subject to a waiting period of up to days 
in our reinsurance segment  we provide reinsurance of credit and bond insurers exposed to the risks of financial loss arising from non payment of trade receivables covered by a policy credit insurance or non performance bonding 
this credit exposure in our reinsurance segment relates primarily to exposures arising in western economies  although in we also began writing surety business in the us and latin america 
our insureds are generally able to reduce or cancel limits under whole turnover credit insurance at any time without prior notice 
this enables our insureds to act quickly to specific distressed credits and therefore the potential loss exposures can be significantly reduced 

table of contents managing investment risks investment risk encompasses the risk of loss in our investment portfolio as a result of market risks  as well as risks inherent in individual securities 
market risks represent the adverse impact on our cash and investments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates inclusive of credit spreads  equity prices and foreign currency rates 
we manage the risks in our investment portfolio in a number of ways 
to maintain diversification and avoid aggregation of risks  we place limits on asset class and individual security exposures 
we monitor compliance with these limits on an ongoing basis 
further  except for the use of leverage within our investment in medium term notes  our investment policy and guidelines do not permit the use of leverage in any of our fixed maturity portfolios 
we also manage the duration of our investment portfolio to approximate the anticipated duration of our re insurance liabilities  so that changes in interest rates have approximately offsetting economic value impacts on our assets and liabilities 
additionally  we manage foreign currency risk by seeking to match our estimated insurance and reinsurance liabilities payable in foreign currencies with assets  including cash and investments that are denominated in such currencies 
when necessary  we may also use derivatives  such as forward contracts and currency options  to economically hedge portions of our un matched foreign currency exposures 
we regularly stress test our investment portfolio using historical and hypothetical scenarios to analyze the impact of unusual market conditions and to ensure potential investment losses remain within our risk appetite 
managing operational risks operational risk represents the risk of financial loss as a result of inadequate processes  system failures  human error or external events 
operational risks include for example  employee or third party fraud  business interruptions  inaccurate processing of transactions  it failures  the loss of key employees without appropriate successors and non compliance with reporting obligations 
we maintain an operational loss event database which helps us better monitor and analyze potential operational risk and identify any potential trends within the business 
we manage transaction type operational risks on a regular basis through the application of strong process controls throughout our business 
in testing these controls  we supplement the work of our internal audit team  with regular management initiated audits mias 
these are audits completed within all of our business segments by teams independent of the professionals who originated the transactions under audit 
the mias allow us to test the robustness of our underwriting and operating processes to ensure that we have early indicators for any future trends in our operational risk 
for enterprise wide risks  such as business continuity  it and human capital  we continue to review our key risks  and focus our efforts accordingly 
one such focus is our business continuity plans  with an emphasis on recovery from unexpected events such as a natural catastrophe and possibility of a pandemic 
during  we continued to review our business continuity planning procedures through cyclical planned tests  all of which were completed satisfactorily 

table of contents with respect to it risk  the dependency of our core processes on it is rapidly increasing  with corresponding implications for risk 
it is therefore important that we ensure the availability of applications and the integrity and security of critical data 
during  we implemented additional levels of back up across our core processing systems  communication networks and databases to mitigate the disruption to fundamental business processing 
we also expanded our usability of remote application technologies ie  remote access  web applications  video conferencing  and geographically dispersed data synchronization to meet the demands of a more mobile and dispersed workforce 
our use of third party vendors exposes us to a number of increased operational risks  including the risk of security breaches  fraud  non compliance with laws and regulations or internal guidelines and inadequate service 
we manage third party vendor risk  by  among other things  performing a thorough risk assessment on potential vendors  reviewing a vendor s financial stability  ability to provide ongoing service  business continuity planning and its scalability up or down 
we also allocate appropriate resources to monitor our significant third party relationships and provide the necessary oversight

table of contents item a risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the occurrence of natural and man made disasters 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected losses resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events 
catastrophes can be caused by various events  including hurricanes  typhoons  earthquakes  hailstorms  explosions  severe winter weather  fires  and other natural or man made disasters 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and our losses from catastrophes could be substantial 
increases in the values and concentrations of insured property may increase the severity of these occurrences in the future 
also  changes in climate conditions may further increase the frequency and severity of catastrophe activity and losses in the future 
as an example of the impact of catastrophe events  in we incurred net losses on hurricanes ike and gustav of million  which materially reduced our net income for that year 
although we attempt to manage our exposure to such events through the use of underwriting controls and the purchase of third party reinsurance  catastrophic events are inherently unpredictable and the actual nature of such events when they occur could be more frequent or severe than contemplated in our pricing and risk management expectations 
as a result  the occurrence of one or more catastrophe events could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the persistence of the recent financial crisis or recurrence of a similar crisis could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
worldwide financial markets recently experienced unprecedented volatility and disruption including  among other things  dislocation in the mortgage and asset backed securities markets  deleveraging and decreased liquidity generally  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions 
these events resulted in extraordinary responses by governments worldwide  including the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of and the american recovery and reinvestment act in in the us this market turmoil has affected among other aspects of our business the demand for and claims made under our products  the ability of customers  counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us  our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources and our investment performance 
while financial markets have stabilized in recent months  there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the timeline for global economic recovery 
as such  evolving market conditions may continue to affect our results of operations  financial position and capital resources 
in the event that a similar market disruption recurs  it could result in a prolonged economic downturn or recession and our results of operations  financial position and or liquidity  and competitive landscape could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we could face unanticipated losses from war  terrorism and political unrest  and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have substantial exposure to unexpected losses resulting from war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
in certain instances  we specifically insure and reinsure risks resulting from acts of terrorism 
even in cases where we attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages written by us  there can be no assurance that a court or arbitration panel will interpret policy language or otherwise issue a ruling favorable to us 
accordingly  we can offer no assurance that our reserves will be adequate to cover losses should they materialize 
we have limited terrorism coverage in our own reinsurance program for our exposure to catastrophe losses related to acts of terrorism 
furthermore  although the terrorism risk insurance extension act of triea provides benefits in the event of certain acts of terrorism  those benefits are subject to a deductible and to other limitations 
under triea  once our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism exceed of our direct commercial property and liability insurance premiums for the preceding calendar year  the federal government will reimburse us for of such losses in excess of this deductible 
notably  triea does not provide coverage for reinsurance losses or for losses involving nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological events 
given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism losses  as well as the limited terrorism coverage in our own reinsurance program  future losses from acts of terrorism  particularly those in our reinsurance segment or those involving nuclear  biological  chemical or radiological events  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and or liquidity in future periods 
triea may not be extended beyond our credit and political risk insurance line of business protects insureds with interests in foreign jurisdictions in the event governmental action prevents them from exercising their contractual rights and may also protect their assets against physical damage perils 
this may include risks arising from expropriation  forced abandonment  license cancellation  trade embargo  contract frustration  non payment  war on land or political violence including terrorism  revolution  insurrection and civil unrest 
political risk insurance is typically provided to financial institutions  equity investors  exporters  importers  export credit agencies and multilateral agencies in an array of industries  in connection with investments and contracts in both emerging markets and developed countries 
our credit and political risk line of business also protects insureds in foreign jurisdictions against non payment coverage on specific loan obligations as a result of commercial as well as political risk events 
the vast majority of the credit insurance provided is for single named illiquid risks  primarily in the form of secured bank loans that can be individually analyzed and written 
we avoid insurance for structured finance products defined by pools of risks and insurance for synthetic products that would expose us to mark to market losses 
we also avoid terms in our credit insurance contracts which introduce liquidity risk  most notably  in the form of a collateralization requirement upon a ratings downgrade 
although we also attempt to manage our exposure  by among other things  setting credit limits by country  region  industry and individual counterparty and regularly reviewing our aggregate exposures  the occurrence of one or more large losses on our credit insurance portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents if actual claims exceed our loss reserves  our financial results could be adversely affected 
while we believe that our loss reserves at december  are adequate  new information  events or circumstances  unknown at the original valuation date  may lead to future developments in our ultimate losses significantly greater or less than the reserves currently provided 
the actual final cost of settling claims outstanding at december  as well as claims expected to arise from unexpired period of risk is uncertain 
there are many other factors that would cause our reserves to increase or decrease  which include  but are not limited to  changes in claim severity  changes in the expected level of reported claims  judicial action changing the scope and or liability of coverage  changes in the legislative  regulatory  social and economic environment and unexpected changes in loss inflation 
the uncertainty in our reserve estimate is particularly pronounced for a company like ours that has a limited operating history and therefore relies more upon industry benchmarks 
to reduce some of the uncertainty  management performs an analysis of additional factors to be considered when establishing our ibnr  intended to enhance our best estimate beyond quantitative techniques 
at december   we recorded additional ibnr for uncertainties relating to the timing of the emergence of claims 
although time lags are incorporated within the actuarial methods discussed above  these rely on industry experience which may not be indicative of our business 
for example  the low frequency  high severity nature of much of our business  together with the vast and diverse expanse of our worldwide exposures  may limit the usefulness of claims experience of other insurers and reinsurers for similar types of business 
changes to our previous estimate of prior year loss reserves can impact the reported calendar year underwriting results by worsening our reported results if reserves prove to be deficient or improving our reported results if reserves prove to be redundant 
if our net income is insufficient to absorb a required increase in our loss reserves  we would incur an operating loss and could incur a reduction of our capital 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social  political and other environmental conditions change  unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims  such as the effects that recent disruptions in the credit markets could have on the number and size of reported claims under directors and officers and professional liability insurance lines of business 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued the insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
in addition  our actual losses may vary materially from our current estimate of the loss based on a number of factors see above 
as a result  the full extent of liability under an insurance or reinsurance contract may not be known for many years after such contract is issued and a loss occurs 

table of contents the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
we seek to mitigate our loss exposure by writing a number of our insurance and reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis 
excess of loss insurance and reinsurance indemnifies the insured against losses in excess of a specified amount 
we generally limit the program size for each client on our insurance business and purchase reinsurance for many of our lines of business 
in the case of proportional reinsurance treaties  we seek per occurrence limitations or loss and loss expense ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
in proportional reinsurance  the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the reinsured 
we also seek to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
geographic zone limitations involve significant underwriting judgments  including the determination of the area of the zones and the inclusion of a particular policy within a particular zone s limits 
in addition  various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum negotiated to limit our risks may not be enforceable in the manner we intend 
we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods will be effective and mitigate our loss exposure 
as a result of these risks  one or more catastrophic or other events could result in claims that substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
the risk associated with reinsurance underwriting could adversely affect us 
in our reinsurance business  we do not always separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under reinsurance treaties 
this is common among reinsurers 
therefore  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by insurers that reinsure their liabilities  or ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
we could be materially adversely affected to the extent that managing general agents  general agents and other producers in our program business exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us 
in program business conducted by our insurance segment  following our underwriting  financial  claims and information technology due diligence reviews  we authorize managing general agents  general agents and other producers to write business on our behalf within underwriting authorities prescribed by us 
once a program commences  we must rely on the underwriting controls of these agents to write business within the underwriting authorities provided by us 
although we monitor our programs on an ongoing basis  our monitoring efforts may not be adequate or our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us 
to the extent that our agents exceed their authorities or otherwise breach obligations owed to us in the future  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we choose to purchase reinsurance  we may be unable to do so  and if we successfully purchase reinsurance  we may be unable to collect 
we purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations in order to mitigate the volatility of losses upon our financial results 
a reinsurer s insolvency  or inability or refusal to make payments under the terms of its reinsurance agreement with us  could have a material adverse effect on our business because we remain liable to the insured 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases have prevented  insurers and reinsurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 

table of contents there is no guarantee our desired amounts of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance will be available in the marketplace in the future 
in addition to capacity risk  the remaining capacity may not be on terms we deem appropriate or acceptable or with companies with whom we want to do business 
finally  we face counterparty risk whenever we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance 
consequently  the insolvency  inability or unwillingness of any of our present or future reinsurers to make timely payments to us under the terms of our reinsurance or retrocessional agreements could have an adverse effect on us 
if we experience difficulties with technology and or data security our ability to conduct our business might be negatively impacted 
while technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations  technology initiatives present certain risks 
our business is dependent upon our employees and outsourcers ability to perform  in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion  necessary business functions  such as processing policies and paying claims 
a shutdown of  or inability to  access one or more of our facilities  a power outage  or a failure of one or more of our information technology  telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair our ability to perform such functions on a timely basis 
if sustained or repeated  such a business interruption  system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process business  provide customer service  pay claims in a timely manner or perform other necessary business functions 
computer viruses  hackers and other external hazards including catastrophic events could expose our data systems to security breaches 
these risks could expose us to data loss and damages 
as a result  our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected 
we outsource certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may do so increasingly in the future 
if we do not effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy  third party providers do not perform as anticipated or we experience technological or other problems with a transition  we may not realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties  increased costs and a loss of business 
our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to enhanced risk related to data security  which could result in monetary and reputational damages 
in addition  our ability to receive services from third party providers might be impacted by cultural differences  political instability  unanticipated regulatory requirements or policies 
as a result  our ability to conduct our business might be adversely affected 
our investment portfolio is exposed to significant capital markets risk related to changes in interest rates  credit spreads and equity prices as well as other investment risks  which may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the performance of our cash and investments portfolio has a significant impact on our financial results 
a failure to successfully execute our investment strategy could have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of market risks  including risks relating to general economic conditions  interest rate fluctuations  equity price risk  foreign currency movements  pre payment or reinvestment risk  liquidity risk and credit risk 
although we attempt to manage market risks through  among other things  stressing diversification and conservation of principal and liquidity in our investment guidelines  it is possible that  in periods of economic weakness or periods of turmoil in capital markets  we may experience significant losses in our portfolio 

table of contents our fixed maturities  which represent of our total investments at december   may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates could cause the fair value of our investment portfolio to decrease  resulting in a lower book value 
conversely  a decline in interest rates could reduce our investment yield  which would reduce our overall profitability 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  inflation  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
our fixed maturities may also be adversely impacted by fluctuations in credit spreads 
a credit spread is the difference between the yield on the fixed maturity security of a particular borrower or a class of borrowers with a specified credit rating and the yield of a fixed maturity us treasury security of similar maturity 
accordingly  as credit spreads widen the fair value of our non us treasury fixed maturity security will underperform a us treasury security of similar maturity 
as part of our diversification strategy  of our investment portfolio is invested in equities and other investments 
other investments consist primarily of hedge funds  credit funds  the equity tranches of collateralized loan obligations and a short duration high yield fund 
given our reliance on external investment managers  we are also exposed to operational risks  which may include  but are not limited to  a failure to follow our investment guidelines  technological and staffing deficiencies and inadequate disaster recovery plans 
our operating results may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  a portion of our gross premiums are written in currencies other than the us dollar 
a portion of our loss reserves and investments are also in non us currencies 
we may  from time to time  experience losses resulting from fluctuations in the values of these non us currencies  which could adversely affect our operating results 
although we attempt to manage our foreign currency exposure through matching of our major foreign denominated assets and liabilities  as well as through use of currency derivatives  there is no guarantee that we will successfully mitigate our exposure to foreign exchange losses 
we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully  the frequency and severity of catastrophic events and our ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
we may need to raise additional funds through financings 
if we are unable to do so  it may curtail our growth and reduce our assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
equity financings could be dilutive to our existing shareholders and could result in the issuance of securities that have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our other securities 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents our inability to obtain the necessary credit could affect our ability to offer reinsurance in certain markets 
neither axis specialty bermuda nor axis re ltd 
is licensed or admitted as an insurer or reinsurer in any jurisdiction other than bermuda  ireland and singapore 
because the us and some other jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit on their statutory financial statements for reinsurance obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers unless appropriate security mechanisms are in place  our reinsurance clients in these jurisdictions typically require axis specialty bermuda and axis re ltd 
to provide letters of credit or other collateral 
our credit facility is used to post letters of credit 
however  if our credit facility is not sufficient  or if we are unable to renew our credit facility on commercially affordable terms when it expires on august   or if we are unable to arrange for other types of security on commercially affordable terms  axis specialty bermuda and axis re ltd 
could be limited in their ability to write business for some of our clients 
a downgrade in our credit ratings by one or more rating agencies could materially and negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and or liquidity 
as our ability to underwrite business is dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies  a downgrade  withdrawal or negative watch outlook by any of these institutions could cause our competitive position in the insurance and reinsurance industry to suffer and make it more difficult for us to market our products 
if we experience a credit rating downgrade  withdrawal or negative watch outlook in the future  we could incur higher borrowing costs and may have more limited means to access capital 
a downgrade  withdrawal or negative watch outlook could also result in a substantial loss of business for us as ceding companies and brokers that place such business may move to other insurers and reinsurers with higher credit ratings 
since we depend on a few brokers for a large portion of our revenues  loss of business provided by any one of them could adversely affect us 
we market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers and derive a significant portion of our business from a limited number of brokers 
mmc marsh mclennan companies  inc  including its subsidiary guy carpenter company  inc  aon corporation and willis group holdings ltd  provided a total of of our gross premiums written during our relationships with these brokers are based on the quality of our underwriting and claim services  as well as our financial strength ratings 
any deterioration in these factors could result in the brokers advising our clients to place their business with other insurers reinsurers 
in addition  these brokers also have  or may in the future acquire  ownership interests in insurance and reinsurance companies that may compete with us and these brokers may favor their own insurers reinsurers over other companies 
loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance and reinsurance contracts to brokers  and these brokers pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
although the law is unsettled and depends upon the facts and circumstances of the particular case  in some jurisdictions  if a broker fails to make such a payment  we might remain liable to the insured or ceding insurer for the deficiency 

table of contents conversely  in certain jurisdictions  when the insured or ceding insurer pays premiums for these policies to brokers for payment over to us  these premiums might be considered to have been paid and the insured or ceding insurer will no longer be liable to us for those amounts  whether or not we have actually received the premiums from the broker 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers with whom we transact business 
these risks are heightened during financial instability or an economic downturn or recession 
certain of our policyholders and intermediaries may not pay premiums owed to us due to bankruptcy or other reasons 
bankruptcy  liquidity problems  distressed financial condition or the general effects of economic recession may increase the risk that policyholders or intermediaries  such as insurance brokers  may not pay a part of or the full amount of premiums owed to us  despite an obligation to do so 
the terms of our contracts may not permit us to cancel our insurance even though we have not received payment 
if non payment becomes widespread  whether as a result of bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  adverse economic conditions  operational failure or otherwise  it could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially impact our reported financial results 
unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply with such developments  particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively 
the impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income  net equity and other relevant financial statement line items 
in particular  recent guidance and ongoing projects put in place by standard setters globally have indicated a possible move away from the current insurance accounting models toward more fair value based models which could introduce significant volatility in the earnings of insurance industry participants 
we could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key executives or by an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our success depends on our ability to retain the services of our existing key executives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of any of our key executives or the inability to hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies with respect to our employees  except for our chief executive officer and president  john r 
charman 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying  hiring or retaining successors on terms acceptable to us or on any terms 

table of contents under bermuda law  non bermudians  with some limited exceptions  may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government only upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian  holder of a permanent resident s certificate or holder of a working resident s certificate is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
in  the bermuda government announced a new immigration policy limiting the duration of work permits to between six and nine years  with specified exemptions for key employees 
in march  the bermuda government announced an amendment to the immigration policy which expanded the categories of occupations recognized by the government as key and for which businesses are eligible to apply for holders of jobs in those categories to be exempt from the six to nine year term limits 
the categories include senior executives chief executive officers  presidents through vice presidents  managers with global responsibility  senior financial posts treasurers  chief financial officers through controllers  specialized qualified accountants  quantitative modeling analysts  certain legal professionals general counsel  specialist attorneys  qualified legal librarians and knowledge managers  senior insurance professionals senior underwriters  senior claims adjustors  experienced specialized brokers  actuaries  specialist investment traders analysts and senior information technology engineers managers 
all executive officers who work in our bermuda office that require work permits have obtained them 
competition in the insurance industry could reduce our growth and profitability the insurance and reinsurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete on an international and regional basis with major us  bermuda  european and other international insurers and reinsurers and with lloyds underwriting syndicates  some of which have greater financial  marketing and management resources than we do 
we also compete with new companies that continue to be formed to enter the insurance and reinsurance markets 
in addition  capital market participants have recently created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products 
increased competition could result in fewer submissions  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions  which could have a material adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical  and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates 
the insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorable premium levels 
an increase in premium levels is often offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity  either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers  which may cause prices to decrease 
any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services 
in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds and insurers may affect the cycles of the insurance and reinsurance business significantly 
in recent years  we have experienced a softening market cycle throughout many of our property and liability lines of business  with increased competition  surplus underwriting capacity and deteriorating rates  terms and conditions all having an impact on our ability to write business 
while market conditions generally improved during on many lines of business  there is no assurance that such improvements in rates and conditions will continue 

table of contents the regulatory system under which we operate  and potential changes thereto  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in a time of financial uncertainty or a prolonged economic downturn or recession  regulators may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations  which may result in lower revenues and or higher costs and thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally  including in states of the us and the district of columbia 
our businesses in each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision 
the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require  among other things  that our subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital and liquidity  meet solvency standards  participate in guaranty funds and submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition and compliance with underwriting regulations 
these laws and regulations also sometimes restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital 
these statutes  regulations and policies may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies  to make certain investments and to distribute funds 
the purpose of insurance laws and regulations generally is to protect insureds and ceding insurance companies  not our shareholders 
we may not be able to comply fully with  or obtain appropriate exemptions from these statutes and regulations 
failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and or exemptions under any applicable laws could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business and could subject us to fines and other sanctions 
in addition  changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject or in the interpretation thereof by enforcement or regulatory agencies could have an adverse effect on our business 
potential government intervention in our industry as a result of recent events and instability in the marketplace for insurance products could hinder our flexibility and negatively affect the business opportunities that may be available to us in the market 
government intervention and the possibility of future government intervention have created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets 
government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies  including shareholders of insurers and reinsurers 
an example of such intervention was the expansion of the florida hurricane catastrophe fund in  which increased the capacity of the fund to compete against commercial providers of catastrophe reinsurance 
in addition  in december  the terrorism risk insurance revision and extension act of extended the material provisions of tria for an additional seven years to december  and expanded coverage to include domestic acts of terrorism 
in addition  in recent years certain us and us judicial and regulatory authorities  including us attorney s offices and certain state attorneys general  have commenced investigations into other business practices in the insurance industry 
while we cannot predict the exact nature  timing or scope of possible governmental initiatives  such proposals could adversely affect our business by  among other things providing reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target  requiring our further participation in industry pools and guaranty associations  expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies  eg  following large disasters  further regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies  or disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another 

table of contents in addition  there are efforts currently underway in the us to federally regulate financial services companies  which could include insurance companies  including through the establishment of a us federal regulatory body or agency 
this legislation  if enacted  could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in the regulation of the insurance industry 
the us congress could revisit us federal preemption of state insurance regulations and implement solvency and capital requirements 
we cannot predict whether any us federal legislation will be enacted at all  or if it is enacted  what issues it will address 
any such legislation could have an effect on our business and results of operations 
our ability to pay dividends and to make payments on indebtedness may be constrained by our holding company structure 
axis capital is a holding company and has no direct operations of its own 
axis capital has no significant operations or assets other than its ownership of the shares of its operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  axis specialty bermuda  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe  axis re us  axis specialty us  axis surplus and axis insurance co 
collectively  our insurance subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our insurance subsidiaries in some cases through our subsidiary holding companies  are our primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service payments and other expenses  and to pay dividends to our shareholders 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends and make distributions 
the inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to pay dividends and make payments on our indebtedness 
global climate change may have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition if we are not able to adequately assess and reserve for the increased frequency and severity of catastrophes resulting from these environmental factors 
recent north atlantic hurricane seasons have shown a marked increase in windstorm activity  both in terms of total number of storms and their intensity 
atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the industrial revolution and there is debate as to whether this has caused a gradual increase in global average temperatures 
increasing global average temperatures may continue in the future and could impact our business in the long term 
however  there is little consensus in the scientific community regarding the effect of global environmental factors on the frequency and severity catastrophes 
climatologists concur that heat from the ocean drives hurricanes  but they cannot agree on how much ocean temperature changes alter the annual outlook 
in addition  it is unclear whether rising sea temperatures are part of a longer cycle 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of financial exposure from climate change through our underwriting risk management practices 
this includes sensitivity to geographic concentrations of risks  the purchase of protective reinsurance and selective underwriting criteria which can include  but is not limited to  higher premiums and deductibles and more specifically excluded policy risks 
however  given the scientific uncertainty about the causes of increased frequency and severity of catastrophes and the lack of adequate predictive tools  a continuation and worsening of recent trends may have a material impact on our results of operation or financial condition 

table of contents axis capital is a bermuda company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against it or its directors and executive officers 
axis capital is incorporated pursuant to the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda 
in addition  some of our directors and officers reside outside the united states  and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
as a result  it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states upon those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of us courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
further  it may not be possible to bring a claim in bermuda against us or our directors and officers for violation of us federal securities laws because these laws may have no extraterritorial application under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
there are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce or increase the voting rights of our shares 
our bye laws generally provide that shareholders have one vote for each common share held by them and are entitled to vote  on a non cumulative basis  at all meetings of shareholders 
however  the voting rights exercisable by a shareholder may be limited so that certain persons or groups are not deemed to hold or more of the voting power conferred by our shares 
under these provisions  some shareholders may have the right to exercise their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share 
moreover  these provisions could have the effect of reducing the voting power of some shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may limit a shareholder s exercise of voting rights where it deems it necessary to do so to avoid adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences 
we also have the authority under our bye laws to request information from any shareholder for the purpose of determining whether a shareholder s voting rights are to be limited pursuant to the bye laws 
if a shareholder fails to respond to our request for information or submits incomplete or inaccurate information in response to a request by us  we may  in our sole discretion  eliminate the shareholder s voting rights 
there are provisions in our bye laws that may restrict the ability to transfer common shares and which may require shareholders to sell their common shares 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of any common shares under some circumstances  including if they have reason to believe that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders may occur as a result of such transfer 
our bye laws also provide that if our board of directors determines that share ownership by a person may result in non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders  then we have the option  but not the obligation  to require that shareholder to sell to us or to third parties to whom we assign the repurchase right for fair value the minimum number of common shares held by such person which is necessary to eliminate the non de minimis adverse tax  legal or regulatory consequences 

table of contents applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer  the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the acquiror  the integrity and management of the acquiror s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control 
generally  state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring or more of our common shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of the axis us subsidiaries  the insurance change of control laws of connecticut  illinois and new york would likely apply to such a transaction 
in addition  the insurance acts and regulations in ireland require that anyone acquiring or disposing of a direct or indirect holding in an irish authorized insurance company such as axis specialty europe that represents or more of the capital or of the voting rights of such company or that makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of such company  or anyone who proposes to decrease or increase that holding to specified levels  must first notify the irish regulatory authority of their intention to do so 
they also require any irish authorized insurance company that becomes aware of any acquisitions or disposals of its capital involving the specified levels to notify the irish regulatory authority 
the specified levels are  and or such other level of ownership that results in the company becoming the acquiror s subsidiary within the meaning of article of the european communities non life insurance framework regulations the irish regulatory authority has three months from the date of submission of a notification within which to oppose the proposed transaction if the irish regulatory authority is not satisfied as to the suitability of the acquiror in view of the necessity to ensure prudent and sound management of the insurance undertaking concerned 
any person owning or more of the capital or voting rights or an amount that makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of axis capital would be considered to have a qualifying holding in axis specialty europe 
while our bye laws limit the voting power of any shareholder to less than  there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned or more of our shares did not  because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares  control the applicable insurance subsidiary 
these laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company  including transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable 

table of contents anti takeover provisions in our bye laws could impede an attempt to replace our directors or to effect a change in control  which could diminish the value of our common shares 
our bye laws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors and could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  limitations on the ability of shareholders to remove directors other than for cause  limitations on voting rights and restrictions on transfer of our common shares 
these provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover 
even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt  these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future 
we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march   which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act of bermuda  as amended  has given each of axis capital and axis specialty bermuda an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to axis capital  axis specialty bermuda or any of their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march  our non us companies may be subject to non us tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
axis capital and axis specialty bermuda are bermuda companies  axis specialty holdings ireland limited axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe  and axis specialty global holdings limited are irish companies and axis specialty uk holdings limited axis uk holdings is a uk company 
we intend to manage our business so that each of these companies will operate in such a manner that none of these companies should be subject to us tax other than us excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring us risks and us withholding tax on some types of us source investment income  because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the united states 
however  because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the united states  we cannot be certain that the us internal revenue service irs will not contend successfully that any of axis capital or its non us subsidiaries is are engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
if axis capital or any of its non us subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states  it could be subject to us corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such us business 
if this were to be the case  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our non uk companies may be subject to non uk tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies  other than axis uk holdings  should be resident in the united kingdom for tax purposes and that none of our companies  other than axis ireland holdings and axis specialty europe  should have a permanent establishment in the united kingdom 
accordingly  we expect that none of our companies other than  axis uk holdings  axis ireland holdings and axis specialty europe should be subject to uk tax 
nevertheless  because neither case law nor uk statutes conclusively define the activities that constitute trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment  the uk inland revenue might contend successfully that any of our companies  in addition to axis uk holdings  axis ireland holdings and axis specialty europe  is are trading in the united kingdom through a permanent establishment in the united kingdom and therefore subject to uk tax 
if this were the case  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our non irish companies may be subject to irish tax that may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we intend to operate in such a manner so that none of our companies  other than axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe  and axis specialty global holdings limited should be resident in ireland for tax purposes and that none of our companies  other than axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe  and axis specialty global holdings limited should be treated as carrying on a trade through a branch or agency in ireland 
accordingly  we expect that none of our companies other than axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe and axis specialty global holdings limited should be subject to irish corporation tax 
nevertheless  since the determination as to whether a company is resident in ireland is a question of fact to be determined based on a number of different factors and since neither case law nor irish legislation conclusively defines the activities that constitute trading in ireland through a branch or agency  the irish revenue commissioners might contend successfully that any of our companies  in addition to axis ireland holdings  axis re ltd  axis specialty europe and axis specialty global holdings limited  is resident in or otherwise trading through a branch or agency in ireland and therefore subject to irish corporation tax 
if this were the case  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if corporate tax rates in ireland increase  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
trading income derived from the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on in ireland by axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
is generally taxed in ireland at a rate of 
over the past number of years  various eu member states have  from time to time  called for harmonization of corporate tax rates within the eu 
ireland  along with other member states  has consistently resisted any movement towards standardized corporate tax rates in the eu 
the government of ireland has also made clear its commitment to retain the rate of corporation tax until at least the year if  however  tax laws in ireland change so as to increase the general corporation tax rate in ireland  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents if investments held by axis specialty europe or axis re ltd 
are determined not to be integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by those companies  additional irish tax could be imposed and our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected 
based on administrative practice  taxable income derived from investments made by axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
is generally taxed in ireland at the rate of on the grounds that such investments either form part of the permanent capital required by regulatory authorities  or are otherwise integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by those companies 
axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
intend to operate in such a manner so that the level of investments held by such companies does not exceed the amount that is integral to the insurance and reinsurance businesses carried on by axis specialty europe and axis re ltd 
if  however  investment income earned by axis specialty europe or axis re ltd 
exceeds these thresholds  or if the administrative practice of the irish revenue commissioners changes  irish corporation tax could apply to such investment income at a higher rate currently instead of the general rate  and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
the organization for economic cooperation and development the oecd has published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
in response to a number of measures taken and commitments by the government of bermuda in june   bermuda was listed as a jurisdiction that has substantially implemented those standards 
we are not able to predict what changes will arise from the commitment or whether such changes will subject us to additional taxes 
changes in us federal income tax law or the manner in which it is interpreted could materially adversely affect us 
legislation has been introduced in the us congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies including insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states  but have certain us connections 
for example  legislation has been introduced in congress to limit the deductibility of reinsurance premiums paid by us companies to us affiliates 
a similar provision was included as part of president obama s proposed budget for fiscal year it is possible that this or similar legislation could be introduced in and enacted by the current congress or future congresses that could have an adverse impact on us 
in addition  existing interpretations of us federal income tax laws could change  also resulting in an adverse impact on us
