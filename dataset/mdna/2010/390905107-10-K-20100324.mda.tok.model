the company wishes to advise readers that the factors listed above could affect the company s financial performance and could cause the company s actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for loan losses and valuation of foreclosed assets the company believes that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates of  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss once loans default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
in addition  the bank s regulators could require additional provisions for loan losses as part of their examination process 
the bank s latest annual regulatory examination was completed in november additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   under the section titled item business allowances for losses on loans and foreclosed assets 
judgments and assumptions used by management in the past have resulted in an overall allowance for loan losses that has been sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships 
from time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance  cash flow of the borrower  value of collateral  or other factors 
in these instances  management may have to revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances 
in some cases  additional losses may be realized  in other instances  the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit 
for the periods included in these financial statements  management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses has not changed significantly 
in addition  the company considers that the determination of the valuations of foreclosed assets held for sale involves a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of foreclosed assets reflects management s best estimate of the amount to be realized from the sales of the assets 
while the estimate is generally based on a valuation by an independent appraiser or recent sales of similar properties  the amount that the company realizes from the sales of the assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in these financial statements  resulting in losses that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
acquisition fair value estimates the company considers that the determination of the initial fair value of loans acquired in the march  and september   fdic assisted transactions and the initial fair value of the related fdic indemnification assets involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the carrying value of the acquired loans and the fdic indemnification assets reflect management s best estimate of the amounts to be realized on each of these assets 
the company determined current fair value accounting estimates of the assumed assets and liabilities in accordance with fasb asc sfas no 
r  business combinations 
however  the amount that the company realizes on these assets could differ materially from the carrying value reflected in its financial statements  based upon the timing of collections on the acquired loans in future periods 
because of the loss sharing agreements with the fdic on these assets  the company should not incur any significant losses 
to the extent the actual values realized for the acquired loans are different from the estimates  the indemnification asset will generally be impacted in an offsetting manner due to the loss sharing support from the fdic 
subsequent to the initial valuation  the company continues to monitor identified loan pools and related loss sharing assets for changes in estimated cash flows projected for the loan pools  anticipated credit losses and changes in the accretable yield 
analysis of these variables requires significant estimates and a high degree of judgment 
see note acquired loans  loss sharing agreements and fdic indemnification assets to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangibles assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a process that estimates the fair value of each of the company s reporting units compared with its carrying value 
the company defines reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed 
as of december   the company has two reporting units to which goodwill has been allocated the bank and the travel division which is a division of a subsidiary of the bank 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  then no impairment is recorded 
if the carrying value amount exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  further testing is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
intangible assets that are not amortized will be tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the fair values to those assets to their carrying values 
at december   goodwill consisted of  at the bank reporting unit and  at the travel reporting unit 
other identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to seven years 
at december   the amortizable intangible assets consisted of core deposit intangibles of million at the bank reporting unit and  of non compete agreements at the travel reporting unit 
these amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their value may not be recoverable based on a comparison of fair value 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  the company used a market approach to value its reporting units 
the market approach applies a market multiple  based on observed purchase transactions for each reporting unit  to the metrics appropriate for the valuation of the operating unit 
significant judgment is applied when goodwill is assessed for impairment 
this judgment may include developing cash flow projections  selecting appropriate discount rates  identifying relevant market comparables and incorporating general economic and market conditions 
based on the company s goodwill impairment testing  management does not believe any of its goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired as of december  while the company believes no impairment existed at december   different conditions or assumptions used to measure fair value of reporting units  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the company s impairment evaluation in the future 
current economic conditions the current economic environment presents financial institutions with unprecedented circumstances and challenges which in some cases have resulted in large declines in the fair values of investments and other assets  constraints on liquidity and significant credit quality problems  including severe volatility in the valuation of real estate and other collateral supporting loans 
the company s financial statements have been prepared using values and information currently available to the company 
given the volatility of current economic conditions  the values of assets and liabilities recorded in the financial statements could change rapidly  resulting in material future adjustments in asset values  the allowance for loan losses  or capital that could negatively impact the company s ability to meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity 
general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank the bank  depends primarily on its net interest income  as well as provisions for loan losses and the level of non interest income and non interest expense 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income the bank earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
in the year ended december   great southern s net loans increased million  or  from billion at december   to billion at december  the company added million of loans  net of significant discounts  due to its fdic assisted acquisition of certain teambank loans and other assets and added million of loans  net of significant discounts  due to its fdic assisted acquisition of certain vantus bank loans and other assets 
the pre acquisition loan portfolio decreased by approximately million 
as loan demand is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  and because of the competition we face  we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in prior years 
based upon the current lending environment and economic conditions  the company does not expect to grow the overall loan portfolio significantly  if at all  at this time 
however  some loan categories have experienced increases beyond the additions from the teambank and vantus bank transactions 
the main loan areas experiencing increases in were commercial real estate loans  one to four family and multifamily real estate loans and commercial business loans  partially offset by lower balances in construction loans 
in the year ended december   outstanding residential and commercial construction loan balances decreased million excluding loans covered by loss sharing agreements  to million at december  in addition  the undisbursed portion of construction and land development loans decreased million from million at december   to million at december  much of these changes relates to construction loans for which the projects have been completed and the loan has moved to permanent financing  thereby reducing construction loans and increasing commercial real estate loans 
the company s strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels given the current credit and economic environments 
in addition  the level of non performing loans and foreclosed assets may affect our net interest income and net income 
while we have not had an overall high level of charge offs on our non performing loans prior to  we do not accrue interest income on these loans and do not recognize interest income until the loan is repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loans 
generally  the higher the level of non performing assets  the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income 
we expect loan loss provision  non performing assets and foreclosed assets to remain elevated 
in addition  expenses related to the credit resolution process should also remain elevated 
in the year ended december   great southern s available for sale securities increased million  or  from million at december   to million at december  the company added million and million of investment securities due to its fdic assisted acquisitions of certain investments and other assets of teambank and vantus bank  respectively 
the vast majority of the securities added are agency mortgage backed securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations 
in addition  great southern had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents increased significantly as a result of the fdic assisted transactions 
also in  additional customer deposits were placed with great southern  in addition to the deposits added as a part of the fdic assisted transactions  resulting in increased liquidity 
the company could elect to utilize these funds by repaying some of its brokered deposits which it has done to a large extent during or purchasing additional investment securities  or it may maintain its cash equivalents 
the company attracts deposit accounts through its retail branch network  correspondent banking and corporate services areas  and brokered deposits 
the company then utilizes these deposit funds  along with federal home loan bank fhlbank advances and other borrowings  to meet loan demand 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million  or 
the company added approximately million of deposits due to its assumption of certain teambank deposits and added approximately million of deposits due to its assumption of certain vantus bank deposits 
with these assumptions  the mix of deposits shifted from brokered deposits to checking deposits and retail certificates of deposits 
interest bearing transaction accounts increased million and non interest bearing checking accounts increased million 
retail certificates of deposit increased million while total brokered deposits decreased million 
there is a high level of competition for deposits in our markets 
while it is our goal to gain checking account and certificate of deposit market share in our branch footprint  we cannot be assured of this in future periods 
in addition to these totals at december  and december   were great southern bank customer deposits totaling million and million  respectively  that are part of the cdars program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the fdic deposit insurance limit 
the fdic considers these customer accounts to be brokered deposits due to the fees paid in the cdars program 
total brokered deposits  excluding the cdars accounts discussed above  were million at december   down from million at december  the company decided to increase the amount of longer term brokered certificates of deposit in to provide liquidity for operations and to maintain in reserve its available secured funding lines with the federal home loan bank fhlbank and the federal reserve bank 
the addition of the teambank deposits created additional liquidity and reduced the need for brokered deposits 
the company had issued new brokered deposits which were fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company at its discretion may redeem at par generally after six months 
as market interest rates on these types of deposits have decreased in recent months  the company has redeemed or replaced many of these deposits in in order to lock in cheaper funding rates or reduce some of its excess liquidity 
there are no interest rate swaps associated with these brokered certificates 
our ability to fund growth in future periods may also be dependent on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and fhlbank advances 
in times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits  we have utilized brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund these loans 
these funding sources have been attractive to us because we can create variable rate funding  if desired  which more closely matches the variable rate nature of much of our loan portfolio 
while we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods  if this should happen  the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by market interest rate changes 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the prime rate and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts 
we also have a portion of our liabilities that will reprice with changes to the federal funds rate or the three month libor rate 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
ongoing changes in the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve pose challenges for interest rate risk management 
beginning in the second half of and through september   the board of governors of the frb increased short term interest rates through steady increases to the federal funds rate 
other short term rates  such as libor and short term us treasury rates  increased in conjunction with these increases by the frb 
by september   the frb had raised the federal funds rates by from in june and other short term rates rose by corresponding amounts 
however  there was not a parallel shift in the yield curve  intermediate and long term interest rates did not increase at a corresponding pace 
this caused the shape of the interest rate yield curve to become much flatter  which creates different issues for interest rate risk management 
on september   the frb decreased the federal funds rate by basis points and many market interest rates began to fall in the following weeks 
in the months following september  the frb reduced the federal funds rate by an additional basis points 
the federal funds rate now stands at 
however  funding costs for most financial services companies have not declined in tandem with these reductions in the federal funds rate 
competition for deposits  the desire for longer term funding and wide credit spreads have kept borrowing costs relatively high in the current environment 
the frb most recently cut interest rates on december  great southern has a significant portfolio of loans which are tied to a prime rate of interest 
some of these loans are tied to some national index of prime  while most are indexed to great southern prime 
the company has elected to leave its great southern prime rate of interest at in light of the current highly competitive funding environment for deposits 
this does not affect a large number of customers  as a majority of the loans indexed to great southern prime are already at interest rate floors which are provided for in individual loan documents 
but for the interest rate floors  a rate cut by the frb generally would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as the federal funds rate adjusts 
loans at their floor rates are subject to the risk that borrowers will seek to refinance elsewhere at the lower market rate  however 
because the federal funds rate is already very low  there may also be a negative impact on the company s net interest income due to the company s inability to lower its funding costs in the current environment 
usually any negative impact is expected to be offset over the following to day period  and subsequently is expected to have a positive impact  as the company s interest rates on deposits and borrowings would normally also go down as a result of a reduction in interest rates by the frb  assuming normal credit  liquidity and competitive loan and deposit pricing pressures 
any anticipated positive impact will likely be reduced by the change in the funding mix noted above  as well as retail deposit competition in the company s market areas 
the negative impact of declining loan interest rates has been mitigated by the positive effects of the company s loans which have interest rate floors 
at december   the company had a portfolio excluding the loans acquired in the fdic assisted transactions of prime based loans totaling approximately million with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest 
of this total  million also had interest rate floors 
these floors were at varying rates  with million of these loans having floor rates of or greater and another million of these loans having floor rates between and 
in addition  there were million of these loans with floor rates between and 
at december   million of these loans were at their floor rates 
during and  the company s loan portfolio had loans with rate floors that were much lower 
however  since market interest rates were also much lower at that time  these loan rate floors went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this contributed to a loan yield for the entire portfolio which was approximately and basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  and  respectively 
as interest rates rose in the second half of and throughout and  these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
at december   the loan yield for the portfolio was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest  resulting in lower interest rate margins 
at december   the loan portfolio yield was approximately basis points lower than the prime rate of interest 
during the latter portion of and throughout  as the prime rate of interest decreased  the company s loan portfolio again has had loans with rate floors that went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this contributed to a loan yield for the entire portfolio which was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  the loan yield for the portfolio had increased to a level that was approximately and basis points higher than the national prime rate of interest at december  and december   respectively 
while interest rate floors have had an overall positive effect on the company s results  they do subject the company to the risk that borrowers will elect to refinance their loans with other lenders 
the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by our travel  insurance and investment divisions  late charges and prepayment fees on loans  gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments and other general operating income 
in  non interest income was also affected by the gains recognized on the fdic assisted transactions 
non interest income may also be affected by the company s interest rate hedging activities 
on july   a federal rule will go into effect which prohibits a financial institution from automatically enrolling customers in overdraft protection programs  on atm and one time debit card transactions  unless a consumer consents  or opts in  to the overdraft service 
this recent federal rule is likely to adversely affect the amount of non interest income we generate 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  expenses related to foreclosed assets  postage  fdic deposit insurance  advertising and public relations  telephone  professional fees  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
non interest income for increased million primarily as a result of the one time initial gain of million related to the teambank transaction and the one time initial gain of million related to the vantus bank transaction 
these gains were calculated based upon the initial estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with fasb asc asc allows a measurement period of up to one year to adjust initial fair value estimates as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the initial fair value estimate calculations for the teambank transaction in the first quarter of  additional information was obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of march   which resulted in adjustments to the initial fair value estimates 
most significantly  additional information was obtained on the credit quality of certain loans as of the acquisition date which resulted in increased fair value estimates of the acquired loan pools 
the fair values of these loan pools were adjusted and the provisional fair values finalized 
these adjustments resulted in a million increase to the first quarter initial one time gain of million 
thus  the final first quarter gain on the teambank transaction was million related to the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
other increases in non interest income were primarily the result of income of million recorded due to the discount related to the fdic indemnification asset recorded in connection with the fdic assisted transaction completed in the first quarter of deposit account charges increased primarily as a result of the first quarter of acquisition 
gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans increased due to higher volumes of new purchase and refinance fixed rate loans 
the increase was partially offset by the impairment write down in value of certain investments 
the impairment write down totaled million on a pre tax basis 
it is unclear if or when the values of these investment securities will improve  or whether such values will deteriorate further 
based on these developments  the company recorded an other than temporary impairment 
in addition  non interest income declined due to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits  which resulted in income of million in the year ended december   and was million in the year ended december  this income is part of a accounting restatement in which approximately million net of taxes was charged against retained earnings in this charge has been recovered in subsequent periods as interest rate swaps matured or were terminated by the swap counterparty 
total non interest expense increased in compared to due to costs related to the acquisitions of teambank and vantus bank assets and liabilities  expenses related to fdic insurance premiums and expenses related to problem loans and foreclosed assets 
the company recorded expenses of operating the acquired banking centers and operational areas beginning in the second quarter of in addition  other acquisition costs of certain assets and liabilities of teambank and vantus bank and other related expenses were recorded during due to the increase in the level of foreclosed assets  foreclosure related expenses have increased significantly in compared to in  the fdic significantly increased insurance premiums for all banks 
this resulted in increased expense for the company due to higher assessable deposits and a higher assessment rate 
due to losses and projected losses to the deposit insurance fund  in addition to the regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments  the fdic imposed a five basis point special assessment on all insured depository institutions based on assets as of june  this resulted in additional expense of million  which was recorded by the company in the second quarter of in november  the fdic amended its assessment regulations to require insured depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly regular risk based assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of   and  on december  the company prepaid million  which will be expensed in the normal course of business throughout this three year period 
in addition to the expense increases noted above  the company s increase in non interest expense in the year ended december   compared to  related to the continued growth of the company 
in may  the company opened banking centers in creve coeur  mo 
and lee s summit mo 
business initiatives the company plans to open two to three banking centers per year as market conditions warrant as part of its overall long term strategic plan 
construction plans are underway to build full service banking centers in in forsyth  mo  and des peres  mo 
both banking centers have received necessary regulatory approvals 
the company will build its first facility in forsyth  which is part of the branson  mo  market area 
the facility  located at highway and east of branson  will complement the company s four banking centers operating in this region with three locations in branson and one in kimberling city  mo 
the banking center is expected to open later in the full service banking center in des peres will be the company s second location in the st 
louis metropolitan area 
the des peres location at manchester is approximately seven miles from the company s creve coeur  mo  banking center  which opened in may and is the company s most successful banking center opening to date generating more than million in core deposits 
the company also operates a loan production office and two great southern travel offices in the st

the banking center in des peres is expected to open in late great southern will continue its participation in the fdic s transaction account guarantee program a part of the temporary liquidity guarantee program  which was extended by the fdic until june  by participating in this program  great southern is purchasing additional fdic insurance coverage for its customers 
great southern customers with noninterest bearing deposit accounts  lawyer s trust accounts or iolta s  and now accounts paying interest at a rate less than percent will be fully insured by the fdic regardless of the account balance 
coverage under the transaction account guarantee program is in addition to and separate from the coverage available under the fdic s general deposit insurance rules 
effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank

fdic assisted acquisitions of certain assets and liabilities vantus bank on september   great southern bank entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with loss sharing with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic to assume all of the deposits and acquire certain assets of vantus bank  a full service thrift headquartered in sioux city  iowa 
the company provided significant details about this transaction in its current report on form k a filed on november  this transaction is an opportunistic extension of our business initiatives noted above 
the loans  commitments and foreclosed assets purchased are covered by a loss sharing agreement between the fdic and great southern bank which affords great southern bank significant protection

acquisition costs of the buildings and related furniture and equipment will be based on current appraisals 
since the september acquisition  customer deposits have remained stable with a high retention rate 
at the end of business on december   the company merged the former vantus bank operational systems into great southern s systems 
this conversion allows all great southern and former vantus bank customers to conduct business and have access to consistent products and services at all banking centers throughout the great southern franchise 
back office support functions were consolidated shortly after the systems conversion  with operational efficiencies anticipated to be realized beginning in the first quarter of as a result of the transaction described above  great southern determined current fair value accounting estimates of the assumed assets and liabilities 
this resulted in the company booking a one time gain of million in accordance with fasb asc  in the third quarter of we expect to recognize additional income in future periods as loans are collected from customers and as reimbursements of losses are collected from the fdic  but we cannot estimate the timing of this income due to the variables associated with this transaction 
based on the level of discounts expected to be accreted into income in future years  the acquired vantus bank loans are not considered non performing as we have a reasonable expectation to recover both the discounted book balances of such loans as well as a yield on the discounted book balances

attractiveness of acquisitions great southern s management has from time to time become aware of acquisition opportunities and has performed various levels of review related to potential acquisitions in the past 
these particular transactions were attractive to us for a variety of reasons  including the ability to expand into non overlapping yet complementary markets for the most part  these locations were close enough to be operationally efficient  but didn t overlap our existing footprint 
the very strong market position enjoyed by most of the acquired banking centers 
we reviewed market share and total deposits by banking center and realized that many of these locations were as strong or stronger in their markets than our legacy great southern banking centers 
the attractiveness of immediate core deposit growth with low cost of funds 
over the past several years  organic core deposit growth has been exceptionally difficult as financial institutions fought over deposits 
these acquisitions allowed us to immediately increase core deposits by a significant amount at an attractive cost 
the opportunities to enhance income and efficiency due to duplications of effort and decentralized processes 
the company has historically operated very efficiently  and expects to enhance income by centralizing some duties and removing duplications of effort

comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during the year ended december   the company increased total assets by million to billion 
most of the increase was attributable to the cash  loans  fdic indemnification asset and investment securities acquired in the fdic assisted transactions of teambank and vantus bank 
net loans increased by million  the net increase in loans added from teambank was million and the net increase in loans added from vantus bank was million at december  the main loan areas experiencing increases during were commercial real estate loans  commercial business loans and one to four family and multi family real estate loans  partially offset by significantly lower balances in construction loans 
in the year ended december   the disbursed portion of residential and commercial construction loan balances decreased million excluding loans covered in by loss sharing agreements 
the company s strategy continues to be focused on maintaining credit risk and interest rate risk at appropriate levels given the current credit and economic environments 
the company does not expect to grow the loan portfolio significantly at this time 
related to the loans purchased in the fdic assisted transactions  the company recorded an asset with a remaining balance of million which represents an estimate of the remaining fair value of the fdic indemnification of losses in the teambank and vantus bank loans acquired 
this amount will fluctuate over time  in tandem with the balance of loans acquired in the transaction  as the results of loan workouts and collections are recognized 
available for sale investment securities increased million and cash and cash equivalents increased million 
the increase in investment securities is primarily attributable to the investment securities acquired in the fdic assisted transactions 
during the year ended december   the company experienced excess funding due to increases in deposits and customer reverse repurchase accounts 
in some instances  the company invested these excess funds in short term cash equivalents that caused the company to earn a negative spread 
while the company generally earned a positive spread on securities purchased  it was much smaller than the company s overall net interest spread  having the effect of increasing net interest income but decreasing net interest margin in the early portion of in the latter quarters of  the company s net interest margin improved as brokered deposits were redeemed or replaced with lower rate deposits and retail certificates of deposit matured and were replaced with certificates of deposit that have a lower interest rate 
while there is no specifically stated goal  the available for sale securities portfolio has in recent quarters been approximately to of total assets 
the available for sale securities portfolio was and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
the company expects that it may maintain a higher level of investment securities and cash and cash equivalents for the time being as excess liquidity in these uncertain times for the us economy and the banking industry  subject to funding activities which are discussed below  and recognizing that this will continue to have the effect of suppressing net interest margin and net interest income 
foreclosed assets increased million during the year ended december  see non performing assets foreclosed assets for additional information on the company s foreclosed assets 
total liabilities increased million from december  to billion at december  deposits increased million  securities sold under reverse repurchase agreements with customers increased million and fhlbank advances increased million 
the increase in securities sold under repurchase agreements with customers was the result of corporate customers desires to place funds in excess of deposit insurance limits in secured accounts 
fhlbank advances increased from million at december   to million at december   as a result of the advances assumed in the fdic assisted transaction involving teambank 
the level of fhlbank advances will fluctuate depending on growth in the company s loan portfolio and other funding needs and sources of the company 
total deposits increased million from december  deposits assumed in the fdic assisted transactions were approximately million 
retail certificates of deposit increased million  non interest bearing transaction accounts increased million  and interest bearing checking accounts mainly money market accounts increased million 
checking account balances totaled billion at december   up from million at december  total brokered deposits excluding cdars customer account balances were million at december   down from million at december  in addition at december  and december   there were great southern bank customer deposits totaling million and million  respectively  that were part of the cdars program which allows bank customers to maintain balances in an insured manner that would otherwise exceed the fdic deposit insurance limit 
the fdic counts these deposits as brokered  but these are deposit accounts that we generate with customers in our local markets 
the company had also increased the amount of longer term brokered certificates of deposit during to provide liquidity for operations and to maintain in reserve its available secured funding lines with the fhlbank and the frb 
as market interest rates on these types of deposits decreased in recent months  the company has redeemed or replaced many of these certificates in in order to lock in cheaper funding rates or reduce some of its excess liquidity 
during the year ended december   the company redeemed million of these callable deposits 
in addition  the company has had several brokered deposits mature in without replacement due to the deposit increases in other areas 
the company reduced its short term borrowings by million  to  at december   through repayment of all of its outstanding borrowings from the frb 
total stockholders equity increased million from million at december  to million at december  the company recorded net income of million for the year ended december   common and preferred dividends declared were million and accumulated other comprehensive income increased million 
the increase in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from increases in the fair value of the company s available for sale investment securities 
our participation in the capital purchase program cpp of the us department of the treasury the treasury currently precludes us from purchasing shares of the company s stock without the treasury s consent until the earlier of december  or our repayment of the cpp funds or the transfer by the treasury to third parties of all of the shares of preferred stock we issued to the treasury pursuant to the cpp 
management has historically utilized stock buy back programs from time to time as long as repurchasing the stock contributed to the overall growth of shareholder value 
the number of shares of stock repurchased and the price paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market 
results of operations and comparison for the years ended december  and general including the effects of the company s accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  net income increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net income was million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in non interest income of million  or  an increase in net interest income of million  or  and a decrease in provision for loan losses of million  or  partially offset by a increase in non interest expense of million  or  and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
net income available to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  excluding the effects of the company s accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  net income increased million during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  on this basis  net income was million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in non interest income of million  or  an increase in net interest income of million  or  and a decrease in provision for loan losses of million  or  partially offset by a increase in non interest expense of million  or  and an increase in provision for income taxes of million 
on this basis  net income available to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the information presented in the table below and elsewhere in this report excluding hedge accounting entries recorded for the  and periods is not prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the tables below and elsewhere in this report excluding hedge accounting entries recorded for the  and periods contain reconciliations of this information to the reported information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company believes that this non gaap financial information is useful in its internal management financial analyses and may also be useful to investors because the company believes that the exclusion of these items from the specified components of net income better reflect the company s underlying operating results during the periods indicated for the reasons described above 
the amortization of the deposit broker fee and the net change in fair value of interest rate swaps and related deposits may be volatile 
for example  if market interest rates decrease significantly  the interest rate swap counterparties may wish to terminate the swaps prior to their stated maturities 
if a swap is terminated  it is likely that the company would redeem the related deposit account at face value 
if the deposit account is redeemed  any unamortized broker fee associated with the deposit account must be written off to interest expense 
in addition  if the interest rate swap is terminated  there may be an income or expense impact related to the fair values of the swap and related deposit which were previously recorded in the company s financial statements 
the effect on net income  net interest income  net interest margin and non interest income could be significant in any given reporting period

interest income from investment securities and other interest earning assets increased due to higher average balances  partially offset by lower average rates of interest 
the higher average balances were primarily a result of increased levels of securities and interest earning deposits held for the purpose of liquidity and the securities and cash equivalents added from the acquisitions in the first and third quarters of interest income from loans increased due to slightly higher average balances  partially offset by lower average rates of interest 
the higher average balances were primarily a result of the discounted loans added through the fdic assisted transactions in the first and third quarters of the lower average rates were primarily a result of the lower market interest rates prime rate in compared to  partially offset by the yields earned on the discounted loans added through the fdic assisted transactions in the first and third quarters of interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest income on loans increased due to higher average balances  partially offset by lower average rates of interest 
interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the higher average balance resulted principally from the loans added at their fair market value from the fdic assisted transactions and increases in average balances in commercial real estate loans and one to four family mortgage loans  partially offset by lower average balances in construction loans 
the bank s one to four family residential loan portfolio balance increased in and due to increased production by the bank s mortgage division 
the bank generally sells fixed rate one to four family residential loans in the secondary market 
the bank s outstanding construction loan balance has decreased significantly as many projects have been completed in the past months and demand for new construction loans has declined 
interest income decreased million as the result of lower average interest rates on loans 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the average yield on the company s loan portfolio decreased primarily due to interest rate cuts by the frb in generally  a rate cut by the frb would have an anticipated immediate negative impact on interest income and net interest income due to the large total balance of loans which generally adjust immediately as fed funds adjust 
average loan rates were much lower in compared to  as a result of reduced market rates of interest  primarily the prime rate of interest 
during  the prime rate decreased to a rate of at december   where the prime rate now remains 
a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
the company has a portfolio of prime based loans which have interest rate floors 
prior to  many of these loan rate floors were in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
during and  as market interest rates rose  many of these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
beginning in  the declining interest rates once again put these loan rate floors in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
great southern has a significant portfolio of loans which are tied to a prime rate of interest 
some of these loans are tied to some national index of prime  while most are indexed to great southern prime 
the company has elected to leave its prime rate of interest at in light of the current highly competitive funding environment for deposits and wholesale funds 
this does not affect a large number of customers as a majority of the loans indexed to great southern prime are already at interest rate floors  which are provided for in individual loan documents 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of a positive basis points 
in the year ended december   the average yield on loans was versus an average prime rate for the period of  or a difference of a positive basis points 
for the years ended december  and  interest income was reduced million and million  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  due to work out efforts on non performing loans 
see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased as a result of higher average balances during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in interest earning deposits and available for sale mortgage backed securities  where securities were needed for liquidity and pledging against deposit accounts under customer repurchase agreements and public fund deposits 
the balance of available for sale mortgage backed securities has increased from million at december  to million at december  interest income decreased by million as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  in previous years  as principal balances on mortgage backed securities were paid down through prepayments and normal amortization  the company replaced a large portion of these securities with variable rate mortgage backed securities primarily one year and hybrid arms 
as these securities reached interest rate reset dates in  their rates typically increased along with market interest rate increases 
as market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates generally declined in and  the interest rates on those securities that repriced in decreased at their interest rate reset date 
the majority of the securities added in and are backed by hybrid arms which will have fixed rates of interest for a period of time generally one to ten years and then will adjust annually 
the actual amount of securities that will reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities is subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
these mortgage backed securities are also currently experiencing lower yields due to more rapid prepayments in the underlying mortgages 
as a result  premiums on these securities are being amortized against interest income more quickly  thereby reducing the yield recorded 
in addition in  the company had several agency securities that were callable at the option of the issuer which had interest rates that were higher than the current portfolio average rate 
many of these securities were redeemed by the issuer in and on march  and september   the company acquired approximately million and million  respectively  of investment securities as part of the two fdic assisted acquisitions 
these investments were recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition with related market yields at that time 
in addition to the increase in securities  the company has also experienced an increase in interest earning deposits and non interest earning cash equivalents  where additional liquidity was maintained in and due to uncertainty in the financial system 
these deposits and cash equivalents earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  for the years ended december  and  the average balance of investment securities and other interest earning assets increased by approximately million  due to excess funds for liquidity and the purchase of investment securities to pledge against public funds deposits  customer repurchase agreements and structured repo borrowings 
while the company earned a positive spread on these securities leading to higher net interest income  it was much smaller than the company s overall net interest spread  having the effect of decreasing net interest margin 
see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
total interest expense including the effects of the company s accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or  partially offset by an increase in interest expense on short term and structured repo borrowings of  or  and an increase in interest expense on fhlbank advances of  or 
excluding the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  economically  total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or  partially offset by an increase in interest expense on short term and structured repo borrowings of  or  and an increase in interest expense on fhlbank advances of  or the amortization of the deposit broker origination fees which were originally recorded as part of the accounting change regarding interest rate swaps significantly increased interest expense in  but did not have a significant effect in the year ended december  the amortization of these fees totaled  and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has now amortized the remaining fees as the interest rate swaps and related brokered deposits have been terminated 
in the year ended december   the company amortized  in additional broker fees that were related to deposits originated by the company in these were remaining unamortized fees on deposits that were redeemed at the discretion of the company to reduce some of the excess liquidity and to reduce deposits with interest rates generally in excess of 
the total of such deposits redeemed during was million 
interest expense deposits including the effects of the company s accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  interest on demand deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest throughout and market rates of interest on checking and money market accounts began to decrease in the fourth quarter of as the frb reduced short term interest rates 
these frb reductions continued throughout and some market rates continued to decrease in interest on demand deposits increased million due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  average noninterest bearing demand balances increased from million in the three months ended september   to million in the three months ended september  average noninterest bearing demand balances increased from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the increase in average balances on all types of deposits is primarily a result of the fdic assisted transactions completed in march and september of  as well as organic growth in the company s deposit base 
interest expense on deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  this average rate of interest included the amortization of the deposit broker origination fee discussed above 
interest expense on deposits increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  market rates of interest on new certificates have decreased since late as the frb reduced short term interest rates and other market rates have declined 
a large portion of the company s certificates of deposit portfolio matures within one year  this is consistent with the portfolio over the past several years 
the increase in average balances on certificates of deposit is primarily a result of the fdic assisted transactions completed in march and september of  as well as organic growth in the company s deposit base 
in addition  the company reduced its total balance of outstanding brokered deposits at december  compared to december  included in the brokered deposits total at december   is million which is part of the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
this total includes million in cdars customer deposit accounts and million in cdars purchased funds 
included in the brokered deposits total at december   was million which was part of cdars 
this total includes million in cdars customer deposit accounts and million in cdars purchased funds 
cdars customer deposit accounts are accounts that are just like any other deposit account on the company s books  except that the account total exceeds the fdic deposit insurance maximum 
when a customer places a large deposit with a cdars network bank  that bank uses cdars to place the funds into deposit accounts issued by other banks in the cdars network 
this occurs in increments of less than the standard fdic insurance maximum  so that both principal and interest are eligible for complete fdic protection 
other network members do the same thing with their customers funds 
cdars purchased funds transactions represent an easy  cost effective source of funding without collateralization or credit limits for the company 
purchased funds transactions help the company obtain large blocks of funding while providing control over pricing and diversity of wholesale funding options 
purchased funds transactions are obtained through a bid process that occurs weekly  with varying maturity terms 
excluding the effects of the company s accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  economically  interest expense on deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest expense on fhlbank advances increased due to higher average balances  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
interest expense on fhlbank advances increased million due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the reason for this increase is the addition of advances assumed in the fdic assisted transaction completed in march of interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased million due to a decrease in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  rates on advances decreased as the company employed some advances which matured in a relatively short term and advances which are indexed to one month libor and adjust monthly  taking advantage of the falling interest rate environment 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements increased million due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the increase in balances of short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements was primarily due to significant increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with the company s deposit customers 
in addition  in september  the company entered into a structured repo borrowing agreement totaling million which bears interest at a fixed rate unless libor exceeds 
if libor exceeds  the borrowing costs decrease by a multiple of the difference between libor and 
this rate adjusts quarterly 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements decreased million due to a decrease in average rates on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest in compared to market rates of interest on short term borrowings began to decrease in the fourth quarter of and continued to decrease throughout and  as the frb decreased short term interest rates and other market rates also decreased 
interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased  due to decreases in average rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  as libor rates decreased from the prior year  the interest rates on these instruments also adjusted lower 
the average rate of interest on these subordinated debentures decreased in as these liabilities pay a variable rate of interest that is indexed to libor 
these debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at an average rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income including the effects of the company s accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to in  an increase of basis points 
in  the company decided to increase the amount of longer term brokered certificates of deposit to provide additional liquidity for operations and to maintain in reserve its available secured funding lines with the fhlbank and the frb 
in  the company issued approximately million of new brokered deposits which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company at its discretion may redeem at par generally after six months 
as market interest rates on these types of deposits have decreased in  the company has redeemed or replaced nearly all of these certificates in in order to lock in cheaper funding rates or reduce some of its excess liquidity 
these longer term certificates carried an interest rate that was approximately 
the company decided that maintaining these deposits was justified by the longer term and the ability to keep committed funding lines available 
excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents at rates that resulted in a negative spread 
the average balance of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december  and december   was million and million  respectively 
these levels are higher than our historical averages 
the company s margin was also positively impacted by a change in the deposit mix 
the addition of the teambank and vantus bank core deposits provided a relatively lower cost funding source  which allowed the company to reduce some of its higher cost funds 
the company also had significant maturities in its retail certificate portfolio and renewed many of these certificates at significantly lower rates in many cases 
in addition  the teambank and vantus bank loans were recorded at their fair value at acquisition  which provided a current market yield on the portfolio 
the federal reserve last cut interest rates on december  great southern has a significant portfolio of loans which are tied to a prime rate of interest 
some of these loans are tied to some national index of prime  while most are indexed to great southern prime 
the company has elected to leave its prime rate of interest at in light of the current highly competitive funding environment for deposits and wholesale funds 
this does not affect a large number of customers as a majority of the loans indexed to great southern prime are already at interest rate floors which are provided for in individual loan documents 
at its most recent meeting on march   the federal reserve board elected to leave the federal funds rate unchanged and did not indicate that rate changes are imminent  although banking regulators are advising banks to prepare themselves now for rising interest rates 
for the years ended december  and  interest income was reduced million and million  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by an basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin increased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances decreased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings decreased basis points  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased basis points 
excluding the effects of the company s accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  economically  net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin excluding the effects of the accounting change was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by an basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased million  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  see the company s quarterly report on form q for march   for additional information regarding the large provision for loan losses in the first quarter of the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december   compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in the year ended december   versus million in the year ended december  the amount of charge offs for the twelve months ended december   was due principally to the million which was provided for and charged off in the quarter ended march   related to the company s loans to the arkansas based bank holding company and related loans to individuals described in the company s quarterly report on form q for march  in  the majority of the charge offs related to twelve relationships which were charged down  with the largest charge off being approximately million 
in addition  general market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to increased provisions in both and as properties were transferred into foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense 
management long ago established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio 
more recently  additional procedures have been implemented to provide for more frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size  loan type  delinquencies  on going correspondence with borrowers  and problem loan work outs 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss  and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
loans acquired in the march  and september   fdic assisted transactions are covered by loss sharing agreements between the fdic and great southern bank which afford great southern bank significant protection from losses in the acquired portfolio of loans 
the acquired loans were grouped into pools based on common characteristics and were recorded at their estimated fair values  which incorporated estimated credit losses at the acquisition dates 
these loan pools are systematically reviewed by the company to determine the risk of losses that may exceed those identified at the time of the acquisition 
techniques used in determining risk of loss are similar to the legacy great southern bank portfolio  with most focus being placed on those loan pools which include the larger loan relationships and those loan pools which exhibit higher risk characteristics 
review of the acquired loan portfolio also includes meetings with customers  review of financial information and collateral valuations to determine if any additional losses are apparent 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans  excluding loans supported by the fdic loss sharing agreements  was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at december   based on recent reviews of the company s loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
if economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets former teambank and vantus bank non performing assets  including foreclosed assets  are not included in the totals and in the discussion of non performing loans  potential problem loans and foreclosed assets below due to the respective loss sharing agreements with the fdic  which substantially cover principal losses that may be incurred in these portfolios 
in addition  these covered assets were recorded at their estimated fair values as of march   for teambank and september   for vantus bank  and no material additional losses or changes to these estimated fair values have been identified as of december  as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time  and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate

compared to december   non performing loans decreased million to million 
decreases in non performing loans during the year ended december   were primarily due to the transfer of all or a portion of eight loan relationships from the non performing loans category to the foreclosed assets category five of which were non performing relationships at december  and three of which were added to non performing relationships in  the repayment in full of one relationship which was added to non performing relationships in and the return of two relationships to performing status due to receipt of payments or additional collateral both of which were added to non performing relationships in

of the total million of foreclosed assets at december   million represents the fair value of foreclosed assets acquired in the fdic assisted transactions in march and september of these acquired foreclosed assets are subject to the loss sharing agreements with the fdic and  therefore  are not included in the following discussion of foreclosed assets 
excluding these loss sharing assets  foreclosed assets increased million during the year ended december   from million at december   to million at december  during the year ended december   foreclosed assets increased primarily due to the addition of five significant relationships to the foreclosed assets category and the addition of several smaller relationships that involve houses that are completed and for sale or under construction  as well as developed subdivision lots  partially offset by the sale of similar houses and subdivision lots

the tables below and elsewhere in this report excluding hedge accounting entries recorded for the  and periods contain reconciliations of this information to the reported information prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company believes that this non gaap financial information is useful in its internal management financial analyses and may also be useful to investors because the company believes that the exclusion of these items from the specified components of net income better reflect the company s underlying operating results during the periods indicated for the reasons described above 
the amortization of the deposit broker fee and the net change in fair value of interest rate swaps and related deposits may be volatile 
for example  if market interest rates decrease significantly  the interest rate swap counterparties may wish to terminate the swaps prior to their stated maturities 
if a swap is terminated  it is likely that the company would redeem the related deposit account at face value 
if the deposit account is redeemed  any unamortized broker fee associated with the deposit account must be written off to interest expense 
in addition  if the interest rate swap is terminated  there may be an income or expense impact related to the fair values of the swap and related deposit which were previously recorded in the company s financial statements

interest income for loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets increased due to higher average balances 
interest income for investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased slightly due to lower average rates of interest while loans experienced a significant decrease in average rates of interest due to the significant rate cuts by the frb in interest income loans during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   interest income on loans decreased primarily due to significantly lower average interest rates 
interest income on loans decreased million as the result of lower average interest rates 
the average yield on loans decreased from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  average loan rates were much lower in compared to  as a result of market rates of interest  primarily the prime rate of interest 
during the last quarter of  market interest rates decreased  with the prime rate of interest decreasing by the end of december then in  the prime rate decreased another to a rate of at december  a large portion of the bank s loan portfolio adjusts with changes to the prime rate of interest 
the company has a portfolio of prime based loans which have interest rate floors 
prior to  many of these loan rate floors were in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
during and  as market interest rates rose  many of these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
in  the declining interest rates once again put these loan rate floors in effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been

interest income increased million as the result of higher average loan balances from billion during the year ended december  to billion during the year ended december  the higher average balance resulted principally from the bank s increased commercial real estate lending  single family and multi family residential lending and consumer lending 
the bank s commercial and residential construction and commercial business average loan balances experienced small decreases compared to for the years ended december   and  interest income was reduced million and million  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  due to work out efforts on non performing loans 
see net interest income for additional information on the impact of this interest activity 
interest income investments and other interest earning deposits interest income on investments and other interest earning assets increased as a result of higher average balances during the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  interest income increased million as a result of an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily in available for sale mortgage backed securities  where securities were needed for liquidity and pledging against deposit accounts under customer repurchase agreements and public fund deposits 
the balance of available for sale mortgage backed securities has increased from million at december  to million at december  interest income decreased by million as a result of a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  in previous years  as principal balances on mortgage backed securities were paid down through prepayments and normal amortization  the company replaced a large portion of these securities with variable rate mortgage backed securities primarily one year and hybrid arms 
as these securities reached interest rate reset dates in  their rates typically increased along with market interest rate increases 
as market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates generally declined in and into  the interest rates on those securities that reprice in likely will decrease at their next interest rate reset date 
the majority of the securities added in are backed by hybrid arms which will have fixed rates of interest for a period of time generally three to ten years and then will adjust annually 
the actual amount of securities that will reprice and the actual interest rate changes on these securities is subject to the level of prepayments on these securities and the changes that actually occur in market interest rates primarily treasury rates and libor rates 
in addition at december   the company had several agency securities that were callable at the option of the issuer 
many of these securities were redeemed by the issuer in  so the balance of u 
s 
government agency securities has decreased from million at december  to million at december  this balance has declined further in in addition to the increase in securities  the company has also experienced an increase in interest earning deposits and non interest earning cash equivalents  where additional liquidity was maintained in due to uncertainty in the financial system 
these deposits and cash equivalents earn very low or no yield and therefore negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  total interest expense including the effects of the company s accounting change in for certain interest rate swaps  total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements of million  or  and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or 
excluding the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  economically  total interest expense decreased million  or  during the year ended december   when compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on fhlbank advances of million  or  a decrease in interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements of million  or  and a decrease in interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust of  or 
interest expense deposits including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and  interest on demand deposits decreased million due to a decrease in average rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest in market rates of interest on checking and money market accounts began to decrease in late and throughout as the frb reduced short term interest rates 
interest on demand deposits increased  due to an increase in average balances from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the company s interest bearing checking balances have grown in the past several years through increased relationships with correspondent  corporate and retail customers 
average interest bearing demand balances were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
average non interest bearing demand balances were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest expense on deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest in market rates of interest on certificates of deposit began to decrease in late and throughout as the frb reduced short term interest rates 
as certificates of deposit matured in  they were generally replaced with certificates bearing a lower rate of interest 
in and  the company increased its balances of brokered certificates of deposit to fund a portion of its loan growth 
in  the company increased its balances of brokered certificates of deposit to lengthen a portion of its funding liabilities and to increase liquidity on its balance sheet in addition to its off balance sheet funding credit lines 
brokered certificates of deposit balances increased million in  from million at december   to million at december  a large portion of this increase relates to the program described below 
included in the brokered deposits total at december   is which is part of the certificate of deposit account registry service cdars 
this total includes in cdars customer deposit accounts and in cdars purchased funds 
included in the brokered deposits total at december   was which was part of the cdars 
this total includes in cdars customer deposit accounts and in cdars purchased funds 
cdars customer deposit accounts are accounts that are just like any other deposit account on the company s books  except that the account total exceeds the fdic deposit insurance maximum 
when a customer places a large deposit with a cdars network bank  that bank uses cdars to place the funds into deposit accounts issued by other banks in the cdars network 
this occurs in increments of less than the standard fdic insurance maximum  so that both principal and interest are eligible for complete fdic protection 
other network members do the same thing with their customers funds 
cdars purchased funds transactions represent an easy  cost effective source of funding without collateralization or credit limits for the company 
purchased funds transactions help the company obtain large blocks of funding while providing control over pricing and diversity of wholesale funding options 
purchased funds transactions are obtained through a bid process that occurs weekly  with varying maturity terms 
the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and did not impact interest on demand deposits 
excluding the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and  economically  interest expense on deposits decreased million as a result of a decrease in average rates of interest on time deposits from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   and increased million due to an increase in average balances of time deposits from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the average interest rates decreased due to lower overall market rates of interest throughout interest expense fhlbank advances  short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust interest expense on fhlbank advances decreased  due to a decrease in average balances on fhlbank advances from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the reason for this decrease was the company elected to utilize other forms of alternative funding during in addition  fhlbank advances experienced a decrease in average interest rates from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december   resulting in decreased interest expense of million 
interest expense on short term borrowings and structured repurchase agreements decreased million due to a decrease in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease  average balances increased from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december   resulting in increased interest expense of million 
the increase in balances of short term borrowings was primarily due to increases in securities sold under repurchase agreements with great southern s corporate customers  utilization of the federal reserve s term auction facility and a structured repurchase agreement borrowing entered into in the frb began to lower short term interest rates in the latter portion of and continued to maintain very low rates throughout interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased  due to a decrease in average interest rates from in the year ended december   to in the year ended december  partially offsetting this decrease  interest expense on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust increased  due to increases in average balances from million in the year ended december   to million in the year ended december  the average rate of interest on these subordinated debentures decreased in as these liabilities pay a variable rate of interest that is indexed to libor 
in november  the company redeemed its trust preferred debentures which were issued in and replaced them with new trust preferred debentures 
these new debentures are not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at a rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
in july  the company issued additional trust preferred debentures 
these new debentures are also not subject to an interest rate swap  however  they are variable rate debentures and bear interest at a rate of three month libor plus  adjusting quarterly 
net interest income including the impact of the accounting entries recorded for certain interest rate swaps  net interest income for the year ended december  increased  to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin was in the year ended december   compared to in  a decrease of basis points 
most of the decrease in net interest margin resulted from the decision by the company to increase the amount of longer term brokered certificates of deposit during to provide liquidity for operations and to maintain in reserve its available secured funding lines with the fhlbank and the frb 
in  the company issued approximately million of new brokered certificates which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company at its discretion may redeem at par generally after six months 
as market interest rates on these types of deposits decreased  the company began to redeem some of these certificates in in order to lock in cheaper funding rates 
in addition during  the company issued approximately million of new brokered certificates  which are fixed rate certificates with maturity terms of generally two to four years  which the company may not redeem prior to maturity 
no interest rate swaps are associated with these brokered certificates 
these longer term certificates carry an interest rate that is approximately basis points higher than the interest rate that the company would have paid if it instead utilized short term advances from the fhlbank 
the company decided the higher rate was justified by the longer term and the ability to keep committed funding lines available throughout the net interest margin was also negatively impacted as the company originated some of the new certificates in advance of the anticipated terminations of these existing certificates  thereby causing the company to have excess funds for a period of time 
these excess funds were invested in short term cash equivalents at rates that at times caused the company to earn a negative spread 
the average balance of interest bearing cash equivalents in the three and twelve months ended december   was million and million  respectively 
this compares to the average balance of interest bearing cash equivalents in the three and twelve months ended december   of million and million  respectively 
partially offsetting the increase in brokered cds  several existing brokered certificates were redeemed by the company in as the related interest rate swaps were terminated by the swap counterparties 
interest rate swap notional amounts have decreased from million at december   to million at december  the company expects to redeem or replace more brokered deposits in as the excess liquidity is determined by management to no longer be warranted 
interest rates on brokered deposits of similar maturities to those that are callable by the company have decreased as much as basis points from the rates currently paid on these deposits by the company 
the company currently has approximately million of such brokered deposits which may be redeemed at the company s discretion in the first half of another factor that negatively impacted net interest income in was the elevated level of libor interest rates compared to federal funds rates as a result of credit and liquidity concerns in financial markets 
these libor interest rates were elevated approximately basis points compared to historical averages versus the stated federal funds rate for a significant portion of this elevated spread has continued into as the frb kept the federal funds rate at 
while these libor interest rates are still elevated compared to historical averages in relation to federal funds  they have decreased along with recent decreases in the federal funds rate 
the company has reduced the amount and percentage of interest rate swaps and other borrowings that are indexed to libor 
funding costs related to local market deposits and brokered certificates of deposit have also been elevated due to competition by issuers seeking to generate significant funding 
for the years ended december  and  interest income was reduced million and million  respectively  due to the reversal of accrued interest on loans that were added to non performing status during the period 
partially offsetting this  the company collected interest that was previously charged off in the amount of  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin decreased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances decreased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings decreased basis points  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased basis points 
excluding the impact of the accounting entries recorded for certain interest rate swaps  economically  net interest income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  net interest margin excluding the effects of the accounting change was in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the company s overall interest rate spread increased basis points  or  from during the year ended december   to during the year ended december  the increase was due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
the company s overall net interest margin decreased basis points  or  from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in comparing the two years  the yield on loans decreased basis points while the yield on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased basis points 
the rate paid on deposits decreased basis points  the rate paid on fhlbank advances decreased basis points  the rate paid on short term borrowings decreased basis points  and the rate paid on subordinated debentures issued to capital trust decreased basis points 
the prime rate of interest averaged during the year ended december  compared to an average of during the year ended december  in the last three months of and throughout  the frb decreased short term interest rates 
at december   the national prime rate stood at and the company s average interest rate on its loan portfolio was 
over half of the bank s loans were tied to prime at december   however  most of these loans had interest rate floors or were indexed to great southern bank prime  which has not been reduced below

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  net charge offs were million in versus million in the increase in provision for loan losses and charge offs for the year ended december   was due principally to the million which was provided for and charged off in the quarter ended march   related to the company s loans to the arkansas based bank holding company and related loans to individuals described in the company s quarterly report on form q for march  in addition  general market conditions  and more specifically  housing supply  absorption rates and unique circumstances related to individual borrowers and projects also contributed to increased provisions and charge offs 
as properties were transferred into non performing loans or foreclosed assets  evaluations were made of the value of these assets with corresponding charge offs as appropriate 
in may  the company determined to record a provision expense and related charge off of million related to a million stock loan to an arkansas based bank holding company abhc and the under collateralized portion of other associated loans totaling million  which loans were previously discussed in the company s annual report on form k filed on march   current report on form k filed on may   and quarterly report on form q filed on may  the charge off resulted from the appointment of the fdic as receiver for abhc s subsidiary  abank  by the occ on may   and the closing of abank by the fdic that same day 
as a result of these regulatory actions  the million loan as well as million  representing the undercollateralized portion of other related loans  were charged off by the company  with the provision expense and associated charge off recorded in the first quarter of management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio and or requirements for an increase in loan loss provision expense 
management has long ago established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectability of the portfolio 
more recently  additional procedures have been implemented to provide for more frequent management review of the loan portfolio based on loan size  loan type  delinquencies  on going correspondence with borrowers  and problem loan work outs 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss  and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was  and at december   september   and december   respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on recent internal and external reviews of the company s loan portfolio and current economic conditions 
if economic conditions remain weak or deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional loan loss provisions would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets as a result of changes in balances and composition of the loan portfolio  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time  and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate 
non performing assets at december   were million  up million from december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at december   compared to at december  compared to december   non performing loans decreased million to million while foreclosed assets increased million to million 
commercial real estate  construction and business loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  non performing loans

the company expects to remove this relationship from loans and hold it as a real estate asset once the tax credit process is completed 
to date  six of the ten residential units are leased 
the retail space is not leased at this time 
three other significant relationships were both added to the non performing loans category and subsequently transferred to foreclosed assets during the year ended december  a million loan relationship  which was secured primarily by an office and residential historic rehabilitation project in st

the projects are located in southeast missouri and southwest missouri 
the project in southwest missouri was sold prior to december  the project in southeast missouri remained in foreclosed assets at december   with a balance of million 
while this asset is included in the company s non performing asset totals and ratios  the company does not consider it to be a substandard asset as it produces a market return on the amount invested

potential problem loans 
potential problem loans decreased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems that may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in non performing assets 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans decreased primarily due to the transfer of four unrelated significant relationships totaling million from the potential problem loans category to other non performing asset categories as previously discussed above 
two of these relationships involve residential construction and development loans one relationship in springfield totaling million and one relationship in the st 
louis area totaling million 
the two other relationships involve a motel in the state of florida totaling million and a condominium development in kansas city totaling million 
in addition  one other relationship that is secured primarily by a subdivision and vacant land near little rock  arkansas was removed from the potential problem loan category due to an ownership change in the project  which added equity to the project as well as additional guarantor support  and a reduction of  from the sale of a portion of the collateral 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans increased primarily due to the addition of four unrelated relationships totaling million to the potential problem loans category 
the first relationship consists of an office building and commercial land near springfield  missouri totaling million 
the borrower has experienced cash flow problems on other projects which have led to payment delinquencies on this project 
the second relationship consists of vacant land pad sites to be developed for condominiums near branson  missouri totaling million 
sales of the units have been slower than projections resulting in cash flow problems 
the third relationship consists of subdivision lots in southwest missouri totaling million 
the fourth relationship consists of subdivision lots and houses in southwest missouri totaling million

at december   these seven significant relationships described above accounted for million of the potential problem loan total 
non interest income including the effects of the company s hedge accounting entries recorded in and for certain interest rate swaps  non interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the million  or  decrease in non interest income was primarily the result of the impairment write down in value of certain available for sale equity investments and lower commission revenue from the company s travel and investment divisions  partially offset by an increase in income related to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits 
the impairment write down totaled million on a pre tax basis including million related to fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock  which was discussed in the september   quarterly report on form q 
these equity investments experienced significant fair value declines over the preceding year 
based on these developments  the company recorded an other than temporary impairment 
the company continues to hold these securities in the available for sale category 
the company also recorded an impairment write down of million on a pre tax basis in for the year ended december   commission income from the company s travel  insurance and investment divisions decreased million  or  compared to part of this decrease  was in the investment division as a result of the alliance formed with ameriprise financial services through penney  murray and associates 
as a result of this change  great southern now records most of its investment services activity on a net basis in non interest income 
thus  non interest expense related to the investment services division is also reduced 
the company s travel division also experienced a decrease in commission income of  in compared to customers are reducing their travel as a result of current economic conditions 
a significant increase in non interest income was due to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in fair value of hedged deposits  which resulted in an increase of million in the year ended december   and an increase of million in the year ended december  income of this magnitude related to the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps and the related change in the fair value of hedged deposits should not be expected in future years 
this income is part of a accounting restatement in which approximately million net of taxes was charged against retained earnings in this charge has been and continues to be recovered in subsequent periods as interest rate swaps matured or were terminated by the swap counterparty 
in the first quarter of  the interest rate swap counterparties have elected to exercise the call options on the remaining callable swaps and the company has elected to redeem the related certificates of deposit 
excluding the securities losses and interest rate swap income discussed above  non interest income for the year ended december   was million compared with million for the year ended december   or a decrease of  this decrease was primarily attributable to the lower commission revenue from the company s travel and investment divisions  which was discussed above  partially offset by an increase of  in gains on sales of mortgage loans 
non gaap reconciliation dollars in thousands year ended december  as reported effect of hedge accounting entries recorded excluding hedge accounting entries recorded non interest income net change in fair value of interest rate swaps and related deposits year ended december  as reported effect of hedge accounting entries recorded excluding hedge accounting entries recorded non interest income net change in fair value of interest rate swaps and related deposits non interest expense total non interest expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to i an increase of  or  in salaries and employee benefits  ii an increase of  or  in insurance expense primarily fdic deposit insurance  iii an increase of million  or  in expense on foreclosed assets  iv an increase of  or  in legal and professional fees primarily legal fees related to the credit resolution process and v smaller increases and decreases in other non interest expense areas  such as occupancy and equipment expense  postage  advertising and telephone 
the company s efficiency ratio for the year ended december   was compared to in these efficiency ratios include the impact of the hedge accounting entries for certain interest rate swaps 
excluding the effects of these entries  the efficiency ratio for the full year was compared to in the company s ratio of non interest expense to average assets decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  in  the fdic began to once again assess insurance premiums on insured institutions 
great southern received a deposit insurance credit as a result of premiums previously paid 
the company s credit offset assessed premiums for the first half of  but premiums were owed by the company beginning in the latter half of and throughout the company incurred additional deposit insurance expense of  related to this in compared to due to the increases in levels of foreclosed assets  foreclosure related expenses in were higher than by approximately million net of income received on foreclosed assets 
the company expects that expenses on foreclosed assets and expenses related to the credit resolution process will remain elevated in the company s increase in non interest expense in compared to also related to the continued growth of the company 
in march  great southern completed its acquisition of a travel agency in st 
louis 
in addition since june  the company opened banking centers in springfield  mo

the number of shares of stock repurchased and the price paid is the result of many factors  several of which are outside of the control of the company 
the primary factors  however  are the number of shares available in the market from sellers at any given time and the price of the stock within the market as determined by the market 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is negative 
generally  a rate increase by the frb which does not appear likely in the very near term based on current economic conditions and recent comments by frb officials would be expected to have an immediate negative impact on great southern s net interest income 
as the federal funds rate is now very low  the company s interest rate floors have been reached on most of its prime rate loans 
in addition  great southern has elected to leave its great southern prime rate at for those loans that are indexed to great southern prime rather than wall street journal prime 
while these interest rate floors and prime rate adjustments have helped keep the rate on our loan portfolio higher in this very low interest rate environment  they will also reduce the positive effect to our loan rates when market interest rates  specifically the prime rate  begin to increase 
the interest rate on these loans will not increase until the loan floors are reached and the wall street journal prime interest rate exceeds 
the operating environment has not been normal and interest costs for deposits and borrowings have been and continue to be elevated because of abnormal credit  liquidity and competitive pricing pressures  therefore we expect the net interest margin will continue to be somewhat compressed 
however  if rates remain generally unchanged in the short term  we expect that our cost of funds will continue to decrease as we have redeemed some of our brokered deposits 
in addition  a significant portion of our retail certificates of deposit mature in the next few months and we expect that they will be replaced with new certificates of deposit at lower interest rates 
interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern 
from time to time  the company has entered into interest rate swap derivatives  primarily as an asset liability management strategy  in order to hedge the change in the fair value from recorded fixed rate liabilities long term fixed rate cds 
the terms of the swaps are carefully matched to the terms of the underlying hedged item and when the relationship is properly documented as a hedge and proven to be effective  it is designated as a fair value hedge 
the fair market value of derivative financial instruments is based on the present value of future expected cash flows from those instruments discounted at market forward rates and are recognized in the statement of financial condition in the prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses caption 
effective changes in the fair market value of the hedged item due to changes in the benchmark interest rate are similarly recognized in the statement of financial condition in the prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses caption 
effective gains losses are reported in interest expense and  and  of ineffectiveness was recorded in income in the non interest income caption for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gains and losses on early termination of the designated fair value derivative financial instruments are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield on the related liability over the shorter of the remaining contract life or the maturity of the related asset or liability 
if the related liability is sold or otherwise liquidated  the fair market value of the derivative financial instrument is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or a liability in prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses with the resultant gains and losses recognized in non interest income 
from time to time the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with the objective of economically hedging against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit caused by changes in market interest rates 
the swap agreements generally provide for the company to pay a variable rate of interest based on a spread to the one month or three month london interbank offering rate libor and to receive a fixed rate of interest equal to that of the hedged instrument 
under the swap agreements the company is to pay or receive interest monthly  quarterly  semiannually or at maturity 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was 
at december   the notional amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was approximately million  all of which were in a net settlement receivable position

these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment
