item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with evercore partners inc s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
key financial measures revenue total revenues reflect revenues from our advisory and investment management business segments that include transaction related client reimbursements plus other revenue 
net revenues reflect total revenues less interest expense related to repurchase agreements  senior notes and other borrowings 
advisory 
our advisory business earns fees from our clients for providing advice on mergers  acquisitions  divestitures  restructurings  financings and other strategic transactions 
the amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement 
in general  fees are paid at the time we sign an engagement letter  during the course of the engagement or when an engagement is completed 
the majority of our advisory revenue comes from fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  to secure necessary financing or to achieve necessary regulatory approvals 
revenue trends in our advisory business generally are correlated to the volume of m a activity and or restructuring activity  which tends to be counter cyclical to m a 
however  deviations from this trend can occur in any given year or quarter for a number of reasons 
for example  changes in our market share or the ability of our clients to close certain large transactions can cause our revenue results to diverge from the level of overall m a or restructuring activity 
we operate in a highly competitive environment where there are no long term contracted sources of revenue and each revenue generating engagement is separately awarded and negotiated 
our list of clients  including our list of clients with whom there is a currently active revenue generating engagement  changes continually 
we gain new clients through our business development initiatives  through recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from executives  directors  attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships 
we may also lose clients as a result of the sale or merger of a client  a change in a client s senior management  competition from other investment banks and other causes 
investment management 
our investment management business includes operations related to the management of the institutional asset management  wealth management and private equity businesses 
revenue sources primarily include management fees  which include fees earned from portfolio companies  fiduciary and consulting fees  performance fees including carried interest and gains or losses on our investments 
management fees from eam  ewm and pcb generally represent a percentage of assets under management 
fess from etc and pcb s trust business includes fiduciary and consulting fees  which are generally a function of the size and complexity of each engagement and are individually negotiated 
management fees from private equity operations are generally a percentage of committed capital or invested capital at rates agreed with the investment funds we manage or with the individual client 
performance fees from private equity funds are earned when specified benchmarks are exceeded 
in certain circumstances  such fees are subject to claw back provisions 
portfolio company fees include monitoring  director and transaction fees associated with services provided to the portfolio companies of the private equity funds we manage 
gains and losses include both realized and unrealized gains and losses on principal investments  including those arising from our equity interest in investment partnerships 

table of contents transaction related client reimbursements 
in both our advisory and investment management segments  we make various transaction related expenditures  such as travel and professional fees  on behalf of our clients 
pursuant to the engagement letters with our clients or the contracts with the limited partners in the private equity funds we manage  these expenditures may be reimbursable 
we define these expenses as transaction related expenses and record such expenditures as incurred and record revenue when it is determined that clients have an obligation to reimburse us for such transaction related expenses 
client expense reimbursements are recorded as revenue on the consolidated statements of operations on the later of the date an engagement letter is executed or the date we pay or accrue the expense 
net interest revenue 
net interest revenue is derived from investing customer funds in financing transactions by pcb 
these transactions are principally repurchases and resales of mexican government and government agency securities 
revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are recognized over the term of the repurchase or resale transaction 
net interest revenue also includes interest expense associated with the senior notes  as well as income earned on marketable securities and cash deposited with financial institutions 
operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense 
we include all payments for services rendered by our employees  including our senior managing directors  in employee compensation and benefits expense 
we maintain compensation programs  including base salary  cash and equity bonus awards and benefits programs and manage compensation to estimates of competitive levels based on market conditions 
our level of compensation reflects our plan to maintain competitive compensation levels to retain key personnel  and it reflects the impact of newly hired senior managing directors  including related grants of equity awards valued at current and prior stock prices 
increasing the number of high caliber senior managing directors and portfolio managers and client relationship officers is critical to our growth efforts 
these hires generally do not begin to generate significant revenue in the year they are hired 
our annual compensation program includes stock based compensation awards as a component of the annual bonus awards for certain employees  including certain senior managing directors 
these equity awards are subject to annual vesting requirements over a four year period beginning at the date of grant  which generally occurs in the first quarter of each year  accordingly  the expense is being amortized over the vesting period 
non compensation expenses 
the balance of our operating expenses includes costs for occupancy and equipment rental  professional fees  travel and related expenses  communications and information services  depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses 
we refer to all of these expenses as non compensation expenses 
other expenses other expenses include amortization costs associated with the modification of unvested lp units and certain other awards  charges associated with the may follow on offering  a severance agreement  deferred consideration pursuant to the braveheart sale and purchase agreement in  special charges in conjunction with the cancellation of employee share based awards  the us private equity restructuring and other ongoing strategic cost management initiatives  acquisition and transition costs incurred in connection with the consummation of our acquisition of sfs and the formation of etc and amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions 

table of contents provision for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  accounting for income taxes asc  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
noncontrolling interest we record noncontrolling interest relating to the ownership interests of our current and former senior managing directors and their estate planning vehicles in evercore lp  as well as the portions of pcb  ewm  eam and etc not owned by evercore 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements herein  evercore partners inc is the sole general partner of evercore lp 
prior to the company s stock offering and purchase of the noncontrolling interest in evercore lp in the third quarter of  evercore partners inc had a minority economic interest in evercore lp but a majority voting interest in and controlled the management of evercore lp 
subsequent to the company s stock offering in the third quarter of  in addition to having a majority voting interest in and controlling the management of evercore lp  evercore partners inc has a majority economic interest in evercore lp 
as a result  both before and after the company s stock offering in the third quarter of  evercore partners inc consolidates evercore lp and records a noncontrolling interest for the economic interest in evercore lp held by the limited partners 
for further information see note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december   and for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the revenue and operating expenses of our advisory and investment management business segments in these periods  see the discussion in business segments below 
the global financial markets experienced nearly unprecedented disruption and volatility during and therefore  difficult market conditions persisted throughout most of and continued into these conditions gave rise to increased restructuring activity and decreased m a activity during the capital markets improved in the second half of we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties  nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements

net proceeds in conjunction with this issuance were million 
we contributed all of the net proceeds from this offering to evercore lp  and evercore lp issued to us  lp units 
we used and intend to use these proceeds to expand and diversify our advisory and investment management businesses and for general corporate purposes in our operating subsidiary  evercore lp 
in conjunction with this offering  the members of evercore lp the members exchanged  lp units for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis 
during the third quarter of  we completed an offering of  shares of class a common stock 
net proceeds in conjunction with this issuance were million 
we used all of the proceeds from this offering to purchase from certain holders  including members of our senior management  a number of outstanding lp units that was equal to the number of newly issued shares of class a common stock sold by us in the offering 

table of contents transactions related to the offering resulted in messrs 
altman  beutner our former president  co chief executive officer  chief investment officer and director and aspe  and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  collectively  ceasing to beneficially own at least of the aggregate lp units owned by them on the date of the reorganization  which in turn resulted in the vesting of  or approximately  of the unvested lp units   unvested rsus and  unvested shares of restricted stock 
the vesting of lp units resulted in a non cash charge to compensation expense and an offsetting increase in noncontrolling interest of million on our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december   and the vesting of rsus and restricted stock resulted in a non cash charge to compensation expense of million and an offsetting increase in stockholders equity of million on our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  we refer to the above transactions collectively as the follow on offering 
prior to the follow on offering  each holder of class b common stock had effectively ceded their voting rights with respect to their ownership of class b common stock and lp units to messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe 
subsequent to the follow on offering  each holder of class b common stock is entitled to one vote for each lp unit held by such holder 
in addition  lp units held by members may be exchanged in the future for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis  subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits  stock dividends and reclassifications 
the above exchanges and any such future exchanges are expected to result in an increase in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of evercore lp 
these increases in tax basis increase for tax purposes amortization and  therefore  reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay 
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with members that provides for the payment by us to an exchanging member of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis 
we expect to benefit from the remaining of cash savings  if any  in income tax that we realize 
while the actual amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of exchanges  the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income  we expect that  as a result of the size of the increases of the tangible and intangible assets of evercore lp attributable to our interest in evercore lp  during the expected term of the tax receivable agreement  the payments that we may make to our members are expected to be substantial 
the effects of the tax receivable agreement on our consolidated statement of financial condition as a result of the above exchanges were increases of million and million related to the and offerings  respectively  in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increase in the tax basis of the assets owned by evercore lp  based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the dates of the transactions 
to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset  based on an analysis of expected future earnings  we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance 
we also recorded of the estimated realizable tax benefit which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance as increases of million and million related to the and offerings  respectively  between amounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreements and payable to employees and related parties 
we recorded the remaining of the estimated realizable tax benefit  or million and million related to the and offerings  respectively  as increases to additional paid in capital 
the amounts that were recorded for both the deferred tax asset and the liability for our obligations under the tax receivable agreement have been estimated 
any additional payments under the tax receivable agreement that will further increase the tax benefits and the estimated payments under the tax receivable agreement have not been included in the estimates 
all of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the dates of the exchanges will be included in net income 
similarly  the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income 
future exchanges of lp units for our shares of class a common stock will be accounted for in a similar manner 

table of contents if all of the remaining unvested and unforfeited rsus as of december  were to vest at some point in the future  based on the grant date fair value of the class a common stock deliverable pursuant to such rsus of per share  the total amount of compensation expense that we will record in connection with the vesting of these unvested rsus would be approximately million 
to the extent unvested rsus vest  they are included in weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share  which has a dilutive effect on these measures 
cash flows our operating cash flows are primarily influenced by the timing and receipt of advisory and investment management fees  and the payment of operating expenses  including bonuses to our senior managing directors and employees and interest expense on our senior notes 
our investing and financing cash flows are primarily influenced by activities to deploy capital to fund investments  raise capital through the issuance of stock or debt  payment of dividends and other periodic distributions to our stakeholders 
advisory fees are generally collected within days of billing 
management fees from our private equity investment management activities are generally billed in advance but collected at the end of a half year period from billing 
we traditionally pay a substantial portion of incentive compensation to personnel in the advisory business and to executive officers during the first three months of each calendar year with respect to the prior year s results 
we generally make dividend payments and other distributions on a quarterly basis

our current liabilities include accrued expenses and employee compensation 
we traditionally have made payments for employee bonuses and year end distributions to partners in the first quarter of the year with respect to the prior year s results 
cash distributions related to partnership tax allocations are made to the partners of evercore lp in accordance with our corporate estimated payment calendar  these payments are made prior the end of each calendar quarter 
in addition  dividends on class a common shares are paid when and if declared by the board of directors  which is generally quarterly 
we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including cash  other significant working capital current assets and liabilities  long term liabilities  lease commitments  principal investment commitments related to our investment management business  dividends on class a common shares  partnership distributions and other matters relating to liquidity and compliance with regulatory requirements 
our liquidity is highly dependent on our revenue stream from our operations  principally from our advisory business  which is a function of closing transactions and earning success fees  the timing and realization of which is irregular and dependent upon factors which are not subject to our control 
our revenue stream funds the payment of our expenses  including annual bonus payments  interest expense on our senior notes and income taxes 
payments made for income taxes may be reduced by deductions taken for the increase in tax basis of our investment in evercore lp 
these tax deductions  when realized  require payment under our long term liability  amounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreements 
we intend to fund these payments from cash and cash equivalents on hand  principally derived from cash flows from operations 
these tax deductions  when realized  will result in cash otherwise required to satisfy tax obligations becoming available for other purposes 
our management committee meets regularly to monitor our liquidity and cash positions against our short and long term obligations  as well as our capital commitments 
the result of this review contributes to management s recommendation to the board of directors as to the level of quarterly dividend payments  if any 
as a financial services firm  our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world 
the domestic and global markets and economic conditions have been disruptive and volatile throughout and continued into in particular  the cost and availability of funding have been and may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads in the future 
revenue generated by our advisory business is directly related to the number and value of the transactions in which we are involved 
during periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions  the number and value of m a transactions generally has decreased  thereby reducing the demand for our advisory services among financial services companies seeking such engagements 
our operating results are adversely affected by any such reduction in the number or value of mergers and acquisitions transactions 
this reduction 
table of contents has been partially offset by an increase in restructuring advisory activity 
in addition  as a result of the market and general economic conditions  the private equity funds that our investment management business manages have been impacted by reduced valuations and opportunities to exit and realize value from their investments and our institutional asset management business has generated lower revenue because investment advisory fees we receive typically are in part based on the market value of underlying publicly traded securities 
our profitability may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes in market and economic conditions 
during the second quarter of  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of evercore class a common stock and or lp units 
under this equity repurchase program  equity may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
the timing and the actual amount of equity repurchased will depend on a variety of factors  including legal requirements  price and economic and market conditions 
this program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date 
in addition  periodically  we buy shares into treasury from our employees in order to fund the minimum tax requirements for share deliveries under our share equity plan 
during  we repurchased  shares for million pursuant to the equity repurchase program and  shares for million related to share deliveries

the exercise price for the warrants is payable  at the option of the holder of the warrants  either in cash or by tender of senior notes at the accreted amount  at any point in time 
pursuant to the agreement with mizuho  evercore is subject to certain nonfinancial covenants 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
we have made certain capital commitments  with respect to our investment activities  which are included in the contractual obligations section below 
pcb maintains a line of credit with bbva bancomer to fund its trading activities on an intra day and overnight basis 
the intra day facility is approximately million and secured with trading securities 
no interest is charged on the intra day facility 
the overnight facility is charged the inter bank balance interest rate plus basis points and is secured with trading securities

collateralized financing activity at pcb pcb enters into repurchase agreements with clients seeking overnight money market returns whereby pcb transfers to the clients mexican government securities in exchange for cash and concurrently agrees to repurchase the securities at a future date for an amount equal to the cash exchanged plus a stipulated premium or interest factor 
pcb deploys the cash received from  and acquires the securities deliverable to  clients under these repurchase arrangements by purchasing securities in the open market or by entering into reverse repurchase agreements with unrelated third parties 
we account for these repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements as collateralized financing transactions 
we record a liability on our consolidated statements of financial condition in relation to repurchase transactions executed with clients as securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
we record as assets on our consolidated statements of financial condition  financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value where we have acquired the securities deliverable to clients under these repurchase arrangements by purchasing securities in the open market and securities purchased under agreements to resell where we have acquired the securities deliverable to clients under these repurchase agreements by entering into reverse repurchase agreements with unrelated third parties 
these mexican government securities included in financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition have an estimated average time to maturity of approximately years and are pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements  which are collateralized financing agreements 
generally  collateral is posted equal to the contract value at inception and is subject to market changes 
these repurchase agreements are primarily with institutional customer accounts managed by pcb  are generally in overnight maturities and permit the counterparty to pledge the securities 
increases and decreases in asset and liability levels related to these transactions are a function of growth in pcb s assets under management  as well as clients investment allocations requiring positioning in repurchase transactions 
pcb has procedures in place to monitor the daily risk limits for positions taken  as well as the credit risk based on the collateral pledged under these agreements against their contract value from inception to maturity date 
the daily risk measure is value at risk  which is a statistical measure  at a confidence level  of the potential losses from adverse market movements in an ordinary market environment based on a historical simulation using the prior year s historical data 
pcb s risk management committee meets monthly to analyze the overall market risk exposure based on positions taken  as well as the credit risk  based on the collateral pledged under these agreements against the contract value from inception to maturity date

as of december   we were unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority  hence  per asc  unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the above commitments and contractual obligations 
we had total commitments not reflected on our consolidated statements of financial condition relating to future principal investments of million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents we expect to fund these commitments with cash flows from operations 
we may be required to fund these commitments at any time through december  depending on the timing and level of investments by our private equity funds 
during  we committed to purchase preferred equity of pan 
the equity can be drawn down over a period of seven years  subject to our board s approval 
as of december   we had million of remaining commitment to pan 
during the first quarter of  we committed an additional million to citic securities international partners  ltd csip that is callable on demand by csip s board of directors 
highview has decided against proceeding with its business 
none of the capital highview raised was invested  and highview released us from our capital commitment of million 
on february   we announced the formation of a strategic alliance to pursue private equity investment opportunities with trilantic capital partners and to collaborate on the future growth of trilantic s business 
under terms of the agreement  we issued  restricted share equivalents with a minimum redemption value of million on december  in exchange for a minority economic interest in trilantic and an interest in trilantic s current fund  trilantic global fund iv 
we also will commit of the total capital commitments of trilantic s next private equity fund when it is raised  up to million 
pursuant to the agreement related to the cash equities business  we are committed to maintain at least million of member s equity in egl as measured in accordance with us gaap 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for our commitment related to earn out consideration for etc 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide liquidity  capital resources  market or credit risk support  or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
market risk and credit risk we  in general  are not a capital intensive organization and as such  are not subject to significant market or credit risks 
nevertheless  we have established procedures to assess both the market and credit risk  as well as specific investment risk  exchange rate risk and credit risk related to receivables 
market and investment risk institutional asset management we invest in funds managed by eam and ewm 
these funds principally hold readily marketable investment securities 
as of december   the fair value of our investments with eam and ewm products  based on closing prices  was million 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse change in the market value of the investments would have resulted in a decrease in pre tax income of approximately million for the year ended december  pcb see liquidity and capital resources above for a discussion of collateralized financing transactions at pcb 

table of contents private equity funds through our principal investments in our private equity funds and our ability to earn carried interest from these funds  we face exposure to changes in the estimated fair value of the companies in which these funds invest 
our professionals devote considerable time and resources to work closely with the portfolio company s management to assist in designing a business strategy  allocating capital and other resources and evaluating expansion or acquisition opportunities 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a comprehensive analysis and valuation of all of the portfolio companies 
our analysis includes reviewing the current market conditions and valuations of each portfolio company 
we estimate that a hypothetical adverse change in the value of the private equity funds would have resulted in a decrease in pre tax income of approximately million for the year ended december  exchange rate risk we have foreign operations in mexico and the united kingdom  their respective functional currencies are the mexican peso and british pound sterling 
we have not entered into any transactions to hedge our exposure to these foreign exchange fluctuations through the use of derivative instruments or otherwise 
an appreciation or depreciation of any of these currencies relative to the us dollar would result in an adverse or beneficial impact to our financial results 
a significant portion of our latin american revenues have been  and will continue to be  derived from contracts denominated in mexican pesos and evercore europe s revenue and expenses are denominated primarily in british pounds sterling and euro 
historically  the value of these foreign currencies has fluctuated relative to the us dollar 
for the year ended december   the net impact of the fluctuation of foreign currencies recorded in other comprehensive income and noncontrolling interest within the consolidated statement of equity was million 
it is currently not our intention to hedge our foreign currency exposure  and we will reevaluate this policy from time to time 
credit risks we maintain cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with high credit ratings 
at times  we may maintain deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured fdic limits 
however  we believe that the firm is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institution in which those deposits are held 
accounts receivable consists primarily of advisory fees and expense reimbursements billed to our clients 
receivables are reported net of any allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for bad debts to provide coverage for probable losses from our customer receivables and derive the estimate through specific identification for the allowance for doubtful accounts and an assessment of the client s creditworthiness 
as of december  and  total receivables amounted to million and million  respectively  net of an allowance 
the advisory and investment management receivables collection periods generally are within days of invoice 
the collection period for restructuring transactions and private equity fee receivables may exceed days 
we recorded minimal bad debt expense for each of the years ended december  and with respect to our marketable securities portfolio  which is comprised primarily of highly rated corporate and municipal bonds and seed capital investments  we manage our credit risk exposure by limiting concentration risk and maintaining minimum credit quality 
as of december   we had marketable securities of million  of which were corporate and municipal bonds and other debt securities primarily with s p ratings ranging from aaa to bb and were seed capital investments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements included in this report are prepared in conformity with us gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and their notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities  
table of contents revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition advisory revenue we earn advisory revenue through success fees based on the occurrence of certain events which may include announcements or completion of various types of financial transactions  retainer arrangements and fairness opinions 
we recognize advisory revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement with a client  agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
fees paid in advance of services rendered are initially recorded as deferred revenue  which is recorded within other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition  and recognized as advisory revenue ratably over the period in which the related service is rendered 
investment management revenue our investment management business generates revenues from the management of client assets invested with institutional asset management and wealth management teams and the private equity funds 
institutional asset management revenue earned from the institutional asset management sector includes management fees from eam  pcb and etc 
interest revenue is derived from investing customer funds in financing transactions with pcb 
these transactions are primarily repurchases and resales of mexican government securities 
revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are recognized over the term of the repurchase or resale transaction 
management fees from etc and pcb s trust business include fiduciary and consulting fees  which are a function of the size and complexity of each engagement and are individually negotiated 
investment management fees generated by eam and pcb are generally based on the value of the assets under management and any performance fees that may be negotiated with the client 
these fees are generally recognized over the period that the related services are provided based upon the beginning  ending or average value of the assets for the relevant period 
fees paid in advance of services rendered are initially recorded as deferred revenue  which is recorded in other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition  and is recognized in investment management revenue on the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the period in which the related service is rendered 
generally  to the extent performance fee arrangements have been negotiated  these fees are earned when the return on assets exceeds certain benchmark returns 
performance fees are accrued on a monthly basis and are not subject to adjustment once the measurement period ends annually and performance fees have been realized 
fees are generated by etc and pcb for serving as an independent fiduciary and or trustee and are either based on a flat fee  are pre negotiated with the client or are based on the value of assets under administration 
for ongoing engagements  fees are billed quarterly either in advance or in arrears 
fees paid in advance of services rendered are initially recorded as deferred revenue in other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition  and are recognized in investment management revenue on the consolidated statements of operations ratably over the period in which the related services are rendered 
management fees generated by etc for serving as a consultant on fiduciary services typically include a refundable upfront fee for services to be 
table of contents provided and a delivery fee upon the execution of the project s deliverables 
any fees received before completion of the engagement are recorded as deferred revenue in other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition and is recognized in investment management revenue on the consolidated statements of operations upon the execution of the project deliverables 
wealth management revenue from the wealth management sector is earned through the management of client investment portfolios

private equity revenue from the private equity sector is earned from management fees  portfolio company fees  performance fees and gains losses on investments in private equity funds 
management fees are contractually based and are derived from investment management services provided in originating  recommending and consummating investment opportunities to private equity funds 
management fees are typically paid in advance on committed capital during the private equity funds investment period  and on invested capital  thereafter 
management fees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and revenue is recognized ratably  thereafter  over the period during which services are provided 
the management fees may provide for a management fee offset for certain portfolio company fees we earn 
we also record performance fee revenue from the private equity funds when the returns on the private equity funds investments exceed certain threshold minimums 
these performance fees  or carried interest  are computed in accordance with the underlying private equity funds partnership agreements and are based on investment performance over the life of each investment partnership 
performance fees are recorded as revenue as earned pursuant to the client agreements 
valuation the valuation of our investments in securities and of our financial investments in the funds we manage impacts both the carrying value of direct investments and the determination of performance fees  including carried interest 
effective january   we adopted asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  which among other things requires enhanced disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
level i investments include financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral and our seed capital investments 
level ii investments include our investments in corporate and municipal bonds and other debt securities 
we did not have any level iii investments as of december  we adopted asc  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities asc  which permits entities the option to measure most financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates and to report related unrealized gains and losses in earnings 
we adopted asc on january  and have not elected to apply the fair value option to any specific financial assets or liabilities 
marketable securities investments in corporate and municipal bonds and other debt securities are accounted for as available for sale under asc  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
these securities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
unrealized gains and losses are reported as net increases or decreases to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  while realized gains and losses on these securities are determined using the specific identification method and are included in other revenue on the consolidated statements of operations 
we invest in readily marketable debt and equity securities which are managed by eam and ewm 
these securities are valued using quoted market prices on applicable exchanges or markets 
the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in the consolidated statements of operations in investment management revenue 
marketable securities transactions are recorded as of the trade date 

table of contents financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value our financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value consist principally of foreign government obligations  which are recorded on a trade date basis and are stated at quoted market values 
related gains and losses are reflected in other revenue on the consolidated statements of operations 
we pledge our financial instruments owned and pledged as collateral at fair value to collateralize certain financing arrangements which permits the counterparty to pledge the securities 
equity compensation share based payments on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asc  share based payment asc 
asc supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends asc  statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in asc is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
however  asc requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
prior to the reorganization  we operated as a series of partnerships  limited liability companies and subchapter s corporations and had not historically issued stock based compensation awards 
we adopted asc on january  we granted employees event based awards and performance based awards that vest upon the occurrence of certain events or performance criteria being achieved 
compensation cost is accrued if it is probable that the event or performance condition will be achieved and is not accrued if it is not probable that the event or performance condition will be achieved 
significant judgment is required in determining the likelihood of occurrence or the probability an event s occurrence or that the performance criteria will be achieved 
see note to the consolidated financial statements herein for further information 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing book versus tax treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains and losses on long term investments and depreciation 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the level of historical taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred taxes  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by us in making this assessment 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in and  we concluded that the recoverability of our deferred tax assets in certain of our foreign subsidiaries was not more likely than not to be recoverable  as required by asc as a result of our assessment  we concluded that the net deferred tax assets of these foreign subsidiaries required a full valuation allowance 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
see note to the consolidated financial statements herein for further information 

table of contents in addition  in order to determine the quarterly tax rate  we are required to estimate full year pre tax income and the related annual income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect our overall effective tax rate 
furthermore  our interpretation of complex tax laws may impact our measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
on january   we adopted asc asc provides a benefit recognition model with a two step approach consisting of more likely than not recognition criteria  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
this standard also requires the recognition of liabilities created by differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements herein in regard to the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of assets in accordance with asc  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in this process  we make estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of our reporting units and to project future earnings using valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model 
we use our best judgment and information available to us at the time to perform this review 
because our assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  actual results could differ 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable as prescribed by asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc 
in addition to goodwill and intangible assets  we annually assess our equity method investments for impairment per asc  subsequent measurement 
for the year ended december   we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and equity method investments

on january   the fasb decided to officially defer this standard for certain entities 
the deferral allows asset managers that have no obligation to fund potentially significant losses of an investment entity to continue to apply previous accounting guidance to investment entities that have the attributes of entities subject to asc  financial services investment companies 
the company believes that it appropriately meets the requirements to qualify for this deferral
