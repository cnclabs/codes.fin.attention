item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview historically  our business focused on the design  manufacture and marketing of proprietary automated anastomotic systems used by cardiac surgeons to perform coronary bypass surgery 
we have re focused our business on the development of an endoscopic microcutter product line intended for use by general  thoracic  gynecologic  bariatric and urologic surgeons 
unless and until a microcutter product is developed and cleared for marketing in the united states or elsewhere  or we enter into an arrangement with a development and commercialization partner that provides us with development revenue  we will have ongoing costs related to the development of this potential product line without related revenue 
our c port distal anastomosis systems  or c port systems  are sold in the united states and europe 
the c port systems are used to perform a distal anastomosis  which is the connection between a bypass graft vessel and the target artery 
as of june   more than  c port systems have been sold in the united states and europe 
we also currently sell our pas port proximal anastomosis system  or pas port system  in the united states  europe and japan 
the pas port system is used to perform a proximal anastomosis  which is the connection of a bypass graft vessel to the aorta or other source of blood 
as of june   more than  pas port systems had been sold in the united states  europe and japan 
in addition to our commercialized cardiac surgery products  we are developing the cardica microcutter es  a multi fire endolinear microcutter device based on our proprietary staple on a strip technology  which would expand our commercial opportunity into additional surgical markets 
we use independent distributors and manufacturers representatives to support a small core direct sales team for our c port systems and pas port system in the united states to contain sales costs while continuing to serve our customers and potential customers for our automated anastomosis product line 
we have shifted our development efforts to focus on the cardica microcutter es and other potential products in this anticipated product line 
we manufacture our c port and pas port systems with parts we manufacture and components supplied by vendors  which we then assemble  test and package 
for fiscal year  we generated net revenue of million  including  of development revenue  and incurred a net loss of million 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
to date  our c port and pas port systems have had limited commercial adoption  and sales have not met the levels that we had anticipated 
revenues from product sales and milestone payments were not sufficient to support the operation of our business as we had planned 
if revenue from product sales does not increase  we may be required to delay  further reduce the scope of or eliminate our commercialization efforts with respect to one or more of our products or one or more of our research and development programs 
on august   we entered into a license agreement with intuitive surgical pursuant to which we granted to intuitive surgical a worldwide  sublicenseable  exclusive license to use our intellectual property in the robotics field in diagnostic or therapeutic medical procedures  but excluding vascular anastomosis applications the license agreement for an upfront license fee of million 
we will also be eligible to receive a milestone payment if sales of any products incorporating our patent rights achieve a specified level of net sales within a specified period after the date of the license agreement and will also be eligible to receive single digit royalties on sales by intuitive surgical  its affiliates or its sublicensees of specified stapler and clip applier products covered by our patent rights as well as on sales of certain other products covered by our patent rights that may be developed in the future 

table of contents in addition  on the same date  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with intuitive surgical pursuant to which intuitive surgical paid million to purchase from us an aggregate of  newly issued shares of our common stock the stock issuance 
on april   we entered into an amendment  or note agreement amendment  to our subordinated convertible note agreement  dated june  and as amended to date  with century medical  inc  or century medical  our distributor in japan referred to as the note agreement 
under the terms of the note agreement amendment  we made a principal payment of  to century medical in april  with the remaining million principal amount owed to century medical becoming due on june   which is one year later than the maturity date prior to the note agreement amendment 
on august   we repaid the remaining million principal balance and interest due on the debt facility 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and total short term debt of million 
including the cash received in august in connection with the license agreement with intuitive surgical and related equity investment  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  along with the cash that we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to enable us to conduct our business substantially as currently conducted through september  while our cash resources would permit us to continue through september   we would need to further reduce expenses in advance of that date in the event that we are unable to complete a financing  strategic or commercial transaction to ensure that we have sufficient capital to meet our obligations and continue on a path designed to create and preserve stockholder value 
the sufficiency of our current cash resources and our need for additional capital  and the timing thereof  will depend on many factors  including primarily our ability to meet our microcutter product development objectives and milestones  obtaining regulatory clearance for the cardica microcutter es and other microcutter products  the level of market acceptance of our microcutter products  the extent of our sales and marketing efforts related to our products and the amount of revenue that we receive from product sales  as well as other factors described in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain a credit facility  enter into product development  license or distribution agreements with third parties or divest one or more of our commercialized products or products in development 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  particularly in light of the prices at which our common stock has been recently trading 
in addition  if we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities  new investors could have rights superior to our existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any product development  licensing  distribution or sale agreements that we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights  including with respect to commercialized products or products in development that we would otherwise seek to commercialize or develop ourselves 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient additional financing or enter into a strategic transaction in a timely manner 
our need to raise capital may require us to accept terms that may harm our business or be disadvantageous to our current stockholders 
agreements with cook incorporated in june  we entered into  and in september and in june amended  a license  development and commercialization agreement with cook incorporated  or cook  to develop and commercialize a specialized device  referred to as the pfo device  designed to close holes in the heart from genetic heart defects known as patent foramen ovales  or pfos 
under the agreement  cook funded certain development activities and we and cook jointly developed the device 
if developed  cook would receive an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license  with the right to grant sublicenses  to make  have made  use  sell  offer for sale and import the pfo device 
under this agreement  we received payments totaling  million and million in fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we recorded as development revenue under the agreement a total of  million and million in fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
a total of  under this agreement has been recorded as deferred development revenue on the balance sheet as of june  we are also entitled to receive from cook up to a total of an additional  in future payments if development milestones under the agreement are achieved 
amounts paid but not yet earned on the project are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the related development expenses for certain project activities are incurred 
we would also be entitled to receive a royalty based on cook s annual worldwide sales of the pfo device  if any 
on january   we and cook mutually agreed to suspend work on the pfo project and  accordingly  we do not anticipate receiving any additional payments or recording any additional revenue related to this agreement in the foreseeable future 

table of contents on december   we entered into  and in september amended and in july amended and partially terminated  an agreement with cook to develop the cook vascular closure device 
under the agreement  cook funded certain development activities  and we and cook jointly developed the device  under the direction of a development committee that included representatives from each party 
under the original agreement and the first amendment in september  cook received an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license  with the right to grant sublicenses  to make  have made  use  sell  offer for sale and import the cook vascular closure device for medical procedures in any part of the body 
under this agreement  we received payments totaling approximately million  including  million and million in fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
we recorded as development revenue under the agreement a total of  million and million for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
in july  we entered into a partial termination and second amendment of this agreement to terminate cook s participation in the project and to provide to cook a royalty on net sales of the cook vascular closure device if cardica successfully commercializes the product 
the remaining deferred revenue balance was recognized as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal as we had completed all of our activities under the agreement and no amounts were refundable to cook 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended june   we recognized a total of  of product sales to cook of the cook vascular closure device 
deficiency letter from the nasdaq global market on june   we announced that we received a letter  dated june   from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market notifying us that we did not comply with the million minimum market capitalization for continued listing on the nasdaq global market set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule b a or the minimum market capitalization standard 
the nasdaq marketplace rules provide the company with a grace period of days  or until december  to regain compliance with the listing standards 
on september   we received a letter from the listing qualifications department of the nasdaq stock market notifying us that we had regained compliance with the minimum market capitalization standard 
however  even though we regained compliance with the listing requirements of the nasdaq global market  there is no assurance that in the future we will continue to satisfy such listing requirements  with the result that our common stock may be delisted from that market 
if our stock is delisted from the nasdaq global market  we may still meet the listing requirements for the nasdaq capital market  including the requirement to have a minimum of million in stockholders equity 
if we are unable to list on the nasdaq capital market  it would likely be more difficult to trade in or obtain accurate quotations as to the market price of our common stock 
delisting of our common stock would materially and adversely affect the market price and market liquidity of our common stock and our ability to raise necessary capital 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they require us to make significant judgments and estimates that are used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then the recognition of revenue is deferred until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we record product sales net of estimated product returns and discounts from the list prices for our products 
the amounts of product returns and the discount amounts have not been material to date 
revenue generated from development contracts is recognized when it is earned and non refundable upon receipt of milestone payments or upon incurrence of the related development expenses in accordance with contractual terms  based on the actual costs incurred to date plus overhead costs for certain project activities 
amounts paid but not yet earned on the project are recorded as deferred revenue until such time as the related development expenses are incurred 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis 
inventory write downs are established when conditions indicate that the net realizable value could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand or reductions in selling prices 
inventory write downs are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated net realizable value 
inventory write downs are charged to cost of product sales and establish a lower cost basis for the inventory 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and the risk of lower customer demand levels 
while we believe the current value of inventories represents all known and estimated changes in demand  we have experienced reduced demand for our c port systems and further unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory write downs that could adversely impact our financial results 
clinical trial accounting 
clinical trial costs are a component of research and development expenses and include fees paid to participating hospitals and other service providers that conduct clinical trial activities with patients on our behalf and the cost of clinical trial insurance 
the various costs of the trial are contractually based on the nature of the services  and we accrue the costs as the services are provided 
accrued costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service agreements  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts 
our estimate of the work completed and associated costs to be accrued  includes our assessment of information received from our third party service providers and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate costs associated with various trials at a given point in time 
although our experience in estimating these costs is limited  the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
stock based compensation 
we account for employee and director share based compensation plans  including stock options and restricted stock units  or rsus  pursuant to accounting standards codification  or asc  compensation stock compensation 
stock based compensation cost is measured on the grant date  based on fair value based measurement of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period 
the company selected the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value based measurements of share based awards 
the use of the black scholes model requires the use of assumptions including expected term  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the expected term of options granted is determined using the simplified method 
under this approach  the expected term is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
since the company has limited historical data on volatility of its stock  the expected volatility is based on the volatility of similar entities referred to as guideline companies 
in evaluating similarity  we considered factors such as industry  stage of life cycle  size  and financial leverage 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of each option is based on a risk free zero coupon spot interest rate at the time of grant 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for options and restricted stock awards using the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the award  which generally equals the vesting period of each grant 
we recorded fair value based stock based compensation expense under asc of million  or per share  million  or per share  and million  or per share for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
total compensation expense related to unvested awards not yet recognized is approximately million at june  and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents prior to the adoption of asc  certain stock options were granted with exercise prices that were below the estimated fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
we recorded employee stock based compensation expense associated with the amortization of deferred stock compensation related to these awards of   and  for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
there was no unamortized deferred stock compensation recorded as of june  results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net revenue 
net revenue decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net product sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease of product sales for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily attributable to both lower pas port and c port systems sales in the united states as we transitioned from a direct sales force approach to third party manufacturers representatives and distributors 
for fiscal years and  sales to century medical  inc  our distributor in japan  accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total product sales 
development revenue was  and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the development revenue for the fiscal year was comprised of  for development activities on the pfo project with cook 
our revenue generating development activities related to the cook vascular closure device were completed in fiscal year  and there was no revenue recognized for the fiscal year ended june  related to that agreement 
the total was comprised of million for development activities for the pfo device under a development agreement with cook that we entered into in june  and million for development activities for the cook vascular closure device under a separate development agreement with cook 
on january   we and cook mutually agreed to temporarily suspend work on the pfo project 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales consists primarily of material  labor and overhead costs 
cost of product sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in cost of product sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulted primarily from decreased product sales  partially offset by the increased cost per unit of our inventory due to decreased production volumes 
our cost of product sales was and of our net product sales in fiscal years and  respectively  due to higher overhead costs per unit sold resulting from lower production volumes 
we expect higher costs relative to product sales to continue for the foreseeable future 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our product development  regulatory and clinical groups and the costs of clinical trials 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to a decrease in salaries and benefits of million due primarily to a net decrease in the number of personnel  decreased prototype project materials of  lower non cash stock based compensation expenses of  and lower clinical trial expenses of million as a result of completing the pas port trials and european trials  partially offset by higher molds and tooling expenses of  related to the microcutter program development activities 

table of contents we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute terms in fiscal year as we begin to develop new applications of our technology  including the cardica microcutter es and additional microcutter products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for administrative and sales and marketing personnel  intellectual property and marketing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the net decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to lower personnel  recruiting and travel expenses of million primarily due to a net decrease in personnel  a decrease in marketing activities of  in the united states  a decrease in demonstration product expenses of  for the training of physicians in the united states and a decrease in consulting and professional service expenses of  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in absolute terms in fiscal year as we increase the number of individuals in our sales force and the number of manufacturers representatives and distributors that sell our products 
interest income 
interest income decreased  or  to  for fiscal year from  for fiscal year the decrease in interest income in fiscal year was primarily attributable to lower cash and short term investment balances available for investing during the period and lower overall market interest rates for the fiscal year

under the housing and economic recovery act of and the american recovery and reinvestment act of  or the acts  signed into law in july and february  respectively  taxpayers can claim a refundable alternative minimum tax or research and development credit if they forego bonus depreciation on certain qualified fixed assets placed in service between april and december we computed and recognized credits based on fixed assets placed into service in our fiscal years ended june  and we recorded income tax benefits of  and  in fiscal year and for the us federal refundable credits as provided by the acts 
comparison of fiscal years ended june  and net revenue 
net revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year net product sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase in product sales for the fiscal year ended june  was primarily the result of the introduction of our pas port system in the united states 
product sales for the fiscal year ended june  did not include any pas port system sales in the united states as the system was not cleared by the fda until september however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  total revenue was million compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the lower sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal year were due primarily to lower product sales caused by reductions in force in april and may which included a significant number of individuals in our direct sales force as well as our vice president of sales and marketing 
in addition  in the third quarter of fiscal year we received low orders from our distributor in japan and did not receive a significant order in the fourth quarter for japan

income taxes due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of our deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no benefit has been recognized for our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established as of june  and to reflect these uncertainties 
at june   we had unrecognized tax benefits of  all of which would not currently affect our effective tax rate if recognized due to our deferred tax assets being fully offset by a valuation allowance

net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal was primarily due to net proceeds received from sales of our common stock in november and december on august   we entered into a license agreement with intuitive surgical pursuant to which we granted to intuitive surgical a worldwide  sublicenseable  exclusive license to use our intellectual property in the robotics field in diagnostic or therapeutic medical procedures  but excluding vascular anastomosis applications the license agreement for an upfront license fee of million 
we will also be eligible to receive a milestone payment if sales of any products incorporating our patent rights achieve a specified level of net sales within a specified period after the date of the license agreement and will also be eligible to receive single digit royalties on sales by intuitive surgical  its affiliates or its sublicensees of specified stapler and clip applier products covered by our patent rights as well as on sales of certain other products covered by our patent rights that may be developed in the future

table of contents including the cash received in august in connection with the license agreement with intuitive surgical and related equity investment by intuitive  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  along with the cash that we expect to generate from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs to enable us to conduct our business substantially as currently conducted through september  our estimates and our future capital requirements depend upon numerous factors 
in addition  we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  including assumptions with respect to the level of revenues from product sales  and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
while our cash resources would permit us to continue through september   we would need to further reduce expenses in advance of that date in the event that we are unable to complete a financing  strategic or commercial transaction that generates additional capital to ensure that we have sufficient capital to meet our obligations and continue on a path designed to create and preserve stockholder value 
the sufficiency of our current cash resources and our need for additional capital  and the timing thereof  will depend upon numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the extent of our ongoing research and development programs and related costs  including costs related to the development of the cardica microcutter es and additional potential products in our anticipated microcutter product line  our ability to enter into additional license  development and or collaboration agreements with respect to our technology  and the terms thereof  market acceptance and adoption of our current products or future products that we may commercialize  our level of revenue  costs associated with our sales and marketing initiatives and manufacturing activities  costs and timing of obtaining and maintaining fda and other regulatory clearances and approvals for our products and potential additional products  securing  maintaining and enforcing intellectual property rights and the costs thereof  and the effects of competing technological and market developments until we can generate significant continuing revenue  if ever  we expect to satisfy our future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding of any kind will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of securities  these securities could have rights senior to those associated with our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any licensing or strategic agreements we enter into may require us to relinquish valuable rights 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our commercialization efforts on one or more of our research and development programs  cease operations or cease to be publicly traded 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements effective july   we adopted the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or the codification 
the codification is the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and became effective for interim periods and fiscal years ending on or after september  the codification explicitly recognizes rules and interpretive releases of the securities and exchange commission  or sec  under federal securities laws as authoritative gaap for sec registrants

which addresses the accounting for multiple element arrangements to potentially enable vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit

we do not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have any impact on our results of operations or financial condition upon its required adoption
