table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading integrated global provider of carbon compounds and commercial wood treatment products and services 
our products are used in a variety of niche applications in a diverse range of end markets  including the aluminum  railroad  specialty chemical  utility  rubber  concrete and steel industries 
we serve our customers through a comprehensive global manufacturing and distribution network  with manufacturing facilities located in the united states  australia  china  the united kingdom and denmark 
we operate two principal businesses carbon materials chemicals cm c and railroad utility products r up 
through our cm c business  we process coal tar into a variety of products  including carbon pitch  creosote  naphthalene and phthalic anhydride  which are intermediate materials necessary in the production of aluminum  the pressure treatment of wood  the production of high strength concrete  and the production of plasticizers and specialty chemicals  respectively 
through our r up business  we believe that we are the largest supplier of railroad crossties to the north american railroads 
our other commercial wood treatment products include the provision of utility poles to the electric and telephone utility industries 
our cm c business has entered into a number of strategic transactions during the last three years to expand and focus on its core business related to coal tar distillation and derived products 
in december  we announced that we had entered into a letter of intent to acquire cindu chemicals bv  a coal tar distillation company located in the netherlands 
the acquisition may be completed in the first quarter of for the year ended december  the last date such information is publicly available  cindu s revenues were approximately million 
in may  tangshan koppers kailuan carbon chemical company limited tkk commenced the operation of a new tar distillation facility located in china in the hebei province near the jingtang port with a distillation capacity of  metric tons 
we hold a percent investment in tkk 
finally  in november  we completed a project to expand the capacity of our existing percent owned tar distillation plant in tangshan  china from  metric tons to  metric tons 
on october   we sold our percent interest in koppers monessen partners lp monessen to arcelormittal sa for cash of million plus working capital of million 
net cash proceeds  after deduction for the limited partner interest  taxes and transaction costs  were approximately million 
monessen is a metallurgical furnace coke facility 
effective as of the end of the second quarter of  monessen was classified as a discontinued operation in the company s statement of operations 
in july  we sold our percent interest in koppers arch investments pty limited and its subsidiaries koppers arch to arch chemicals inc for net cash proceeds of million and recognized a gain from the sale  net of tax  of million 
effective as of this date  koppers arch was classified as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations 
koppers arch is a manufacturer of timber preservation chemicals 
monessen and koppers arch were part of our carbon materials chemicals business segment 
outlook trend overview our businesses and results of operations are impacted by various competitive and other factors including i the impact of global economic conditions on demand for our products both in the united states and overseas  ii raw materials pricing and availability  in particular the amount and quality of coal tar available in global markets  which could be negatively impacted by reductions in steel production  iii volatility in oil prices  which impacts selling prices and margins for certain of our products including carbon black feedstock and phthalic anhydride  iv competitive conditions in global carbon pitch markets  v low margins in the utility pole business  and vi changes in foreign exchange rates 
our businesses and results of operations have been impacted by the global recession starting in late and continuing through we expect that  although the global economy and our key end markets appear to have stabilized  we will continue to experience these negative trends in as improvement in our key end markets will emerge slowly over time 

table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report certain key end markets have experienced significant global reductions in demand that has negatively impacted our profitability for our products 
starting in late and continuing into we have seen significant reductions in global production of aluminum  steel  rubber  concrete  plastics and paints  among others  that represent markets in which our products are consumed 
we believe that there will continue to be uncertainty regarding the levels of production going forward 
in addition to reduced demand for our products  many of our customers are aggressively attempting to reduce their manufactured raw material costs 
accordingly  some of our customers are moving toward short term pricing arrangements as opposed to long term contracts with periodic pricing reviews 
in the past year we have seen the temporary idling or closure of several aluminum smelters  particularly in north america and europe  as global production of aluminum declined by approximately six percent over levels 
we expect the trend of closing or reducing production at higher cost smelters to continue as newer  more cost effective smelters come on line in regions with lower cost energy  particularly in the middle east 
as an example we have seen specific closures in north america and europe that will negatively impact volumes in those geographic areas  at this time we cannot predict if or when these idled smelters will return to production 
however  we believe we are well positioned to supply the new middle eastern smelters due to our capacity expansions in china 
we produced lower volumes in as compared to in many of our products which impacted the capacity utilization at our facilities 
we do not expect a dramatic recovery in production volumes during lower throughput volumes combined with increasing pressure for price reductions has led us to review our capacity utilization and has resulted in production cutbacks  from time to time  at certain facilities  which will result in lower margins 
if these trends continue  we may temporarily idle or permanently close facilities 
for example  in december we announced the sale of our gainesville utility pole treatment plant 
utility pole markets are expected to continue to remain competitive with resulting low margins 
we will continue to review underperforming assets and rationalize capacity as necessary to remain competitive in this market and will reduce market share if warranted 
several of our products  particularly carbon black feedstock and phthalic anhydride  have end market pricing that is linked to benchmark oil indices 
during the past few years we have benefited in terms of revenues and profitability from the higher pricing for these products as the cost of coal tar has not increased proportionally with oil 
however  when the price of oil declined in late we saw significant price and profit declines for these products in the availability of a key raw material  coal tar  is linked to levels of metallurgical coke production 
as the global steel industry has reduced production of steel and metallurgical coke the volumes of coal tar by product were also reduced 
our ability to obtain coal tar and the price we are able to negotiate has a significant impact on the level of profitability of our business 
many of our sales contracts include provisions that allow for price increases based on increases in the price of raw materials  which has allowed us to generally maintain profit dollars in our core businesses 
however  significant increases in raw material costs will result in margin dilution because only the increased cost of the raw material is passed on to the customer 
the north american railroad market has experienced better stability than our other end markets over the past year  however  continued negative economic trends could impact the demand for crossties from the short line railroads as well as the class i railroads 
additionally  lumber availability and pricing were negatively impacted in by depressed markets for furniture and hardwood flooring caused by the dramatic decline in the us housing market 
it is likely that housing will remain depressed during and along with extreme weather conditions experienced in the first quarter of  continued difficulties related to cost and availability of hardwoods for crossties may be experienced 
in  we expect that capital spending in the railroad sector will be moderately lower and will be concentrated on maintenance projects as new construction has been deferred 
while class i railroad crosstie purchases are expected to remain at prior year levels  the commercial railroad market continues to be challenging and competitive due to the current economic climate 
net sales over the past several years have been significantly impacted by favorable foreign exchange rates in australia  great britain  europe  denmark and china 
in late and continuing into we saw those trends begin to reverse 
exchange rates for currencies in australia  great britain  europe  denmark  and to a lesser extent  china  have changed significantly and negatively impacted sales and profits in compared to for example  unfavorable changes in exchange rates reduced our sales by approximately million or two percent in as compared to in addition  we expect continued volatility in these exchange rates that could impact our ability to accurately predict future levels of sales and profits 

table of contents seasonality and effects of weather on operations our quarterly operating results fluctuate due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control  including inclement weather conditions  which in the past have affected operating results 
operations at several facilities have been halted for short periods of time during the winter months 
moreover  demand for some of our products declines during periods of inclement weather 
as a result of the foregoing  we anticipate that we may experience material fluctuations in quarterly operating results 
historically  our operating results have been significantly lower in the fourth and first calendar quarters as compared to the second and third calendar quarters 
we expect this seasonality trend to continue in future periods 
due to the concentration of our north american operating facilities in the eastern and mid western portions of the united states  we have been negatively impacted by heavy snowstorm activity in january and february this has resulted in higher operating and logistics costs as well as lower production and shipments of our products at these locations 
we expect that this will have a negative impact our results for the first quarter of results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  consolidated results net sales for the years ended december  and are summarized by segment in the following table year ended december  net change dollars in millions carbon materials chemicals railroad utility products cm c net sales decreased by million or percent due to the following changes in volume  pricing and foreign exchange price volume foreign exchange net change carbon materials a distillates b coal tar chemicals c other d total cm c a includes carbon pitch and refined tar 
b includes creosote and carbon black feedstock 
c includes naphthalene and phthalic anhydride 
d includes carbon black  petroleum pitch  benzole  freight and other products 
carbon materials pricing for carbon pitch increased three percent in the us and australia as customer prices were increased in response to higher raw material costs 
offsetting this increase were lower sales volumes of carbon pitch in the us of nine percent and europe of two percent 
the volume decreases are due to reduced worldwide demand for aluminum products and the related idling of a number of aluminum smelters to reduce supply 
distillate pricing for carbon black feedstock decreased two percent in europe due to lower average worldwide oil prices as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in distillate sales volume is due primarily to lower creosote sales in the us totaling two percent 
for coal tar chemicals  decreases in phthalic anhydride prices in the us of two percent and naphthalene prices of one percent in europe were experienced 
lower volumes of phthalic anhydride of one percent resulted from weakness in the us housing and auto industries 
with respect to other products  benzole and carbon black volumes decreased one percent each as compared to the prior year

sales price increases and volume increases for untreated railroad crossties totaled two and three percent  respectively for the year ended december  offsetting the volume increase in railroad crossties was a decrease of six percent in treated railroad crossties sales  as volume reductions for sales to commercial customers offset volume increases for the class i railroads 
with respect to other products  higher creosote prices of three percent in the us were realized 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was percent for both years ended december  and overall  cost of sales decreased by million when compared to the prior year period due primarily to lower cm c production volumes and foreign exchange 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  was million lower when compared to the prior year period due to an impairment charge of million in related to our glycerine refining plant in the united kingdom 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million lower when compared to the prior year period due primarily to lower salary  incentive  benefit expenses and lower discretionary spending as a result of programs to decrease spending to react to changing global economic conditions 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million lower when compared to the prior year period due primarily to lower average borrowings as compared to the prior period 
lower average borrowings resulted from debt reductions in the fourth quarter of funded by the net proceeds from the sale of monessen in october loss on the extinguishment of debt was million in and resulted from the tender offer and call of the senior discount notes and the call of the senior secured notes 
the gain on extinguishment of debt of million in resulted from the repurchase of senior secured notes at a discount to principal value 
income taxes for the year ended december  were million lower when compared to the prior year period due primarily to the decrease in pretax income of million and estimated taxes on unremitted european earnings for for the year ended december   european earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested and did not attract us taxation 
in  we provided us deferred tax on european earnings of approximately million 
our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  was percent as compared to the prior year period of percent 
for the year ended december   although we had book income before taxes of million  we incurred a us taxable loss  for federal purposes  of million due to the refinancing of the senior discount notes 
this taxable loss occurred due to the ability to deduct accrued but unpaid interest on the senior discount notes for which we had previously provided deferred tax 
as a result we have recorded an income tax receivable of million as of december  to reflect the anticipated refunds of federal and state income taxes paid in and gain on sale of monessen for the year ended december  represents the gain  net of tax expense  from the sale of our percent interest in monessen to arcelormittal sa on october  effective as of this date  monessen was classified as a discontinued operation in our statement of operations

the senior notes are guaranteed by koppers holdings inc  as parent guarantor  and certain subsidiaries of koppers inc as additional guarantors 
a portion of the net proceeds of the offering of the senior notes was used to finance a cash tender offer for  and a redemption of  koppers holdings remaining outstanding senior discount notes due the senior discount notes  with remaining net proceeds used to repay outstanding debt under koppers inc s revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  koppers inc also amended its revolving credit agreement to extend the expiration date of the revolving credit facility to october  and to amend interest pricing and certain covenants 
restrictions on dividends to koppers holdings koppers holdings depends on the dividends from the earnings of koppers inc and its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations  including the payment of any declared dividend of koppers holdings 
in addition  the terms of koppers inc s revolving credit facility and the terms of the senior notes indenture place restrictions on the amount of dividends it may pay to koppers holdings 
the amount of permitted dividends under the revolving credit facility is generally limited by koppers inc s fixed charge coverage ratio covenant  among other terms 
the amount of permitted dividends under the senior note indenture is primarily determined by a derived basket 
the basket is based on the sum of a beginning amount  plus or minus a percentage of koppers inc s consolidated net income as defined in the indenture  plus the net proceeds of koppers inc s qualified stock issuance or conversions of debt to qualified stock  plus the net proceeds from the sale of or a reduction in an investment as defined in the indenture or the value of the assets of an unrestricted subsidiary which is designated a restricted subsidiary 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the senior notes indenture permits an additional aggregate amount of million each fiscal year to finance dividends on the capital stock of koppers holdings  whether or not there is any basket availability  provided that at the time of such payment  no default in the indenture has occurred or would result from financing the dividends 
significant reductions in net income  or increases to indebtedness affecting compliance with financial covenants or availability under the revolving credit facility would restrict koppers inc s ability to pay dividends

liquidity the koppers inc revolving credit facility agreement provides for a revolving credit facility of up to million at variable rates 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of koppers inc s assets 
the revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that limit capital expenditures by koppers inc and restrict its ability to incur additional indebtedness  create liens on its assets  enter into leases  pay dividends and make investments or acquisitions 
in addition  such covenants give rise to events of default upon the failure by koppers inc to meet certain financial ratios 
as of december   the company had million of unused revolving credit availability for working capital purposes after restrictions by various debt covenants and certain letter of credit commitments 
as of december   million of commitments were utilized by outstanding letters of credit 

table of contents the following table summarizes our estimated liquidity as of december  dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents amount available under revolving credit facility amount available under other credit facilities total estimated liquidity our estimated liquidity was million at december  the decrease in estimated liquidity from that date is due primarily to a decrease in availability under the revolving credit facility due to an increase in borrowing of million under the revolving credit facility and other covenant restrictions 
as of december   we had million aggregate amount of common stock  debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants or a combination of these securities available to be issued under our registration statement on form s filed in our need for cash in the next twelve months relates primarily to contractual obligations which include debt service  purchase commitments and operating leases  as well as for working capital  capital maintenance programs and mandatory defined benefit plan funding 
we may also use cash to pursue potential strategic acquisitions 
capital expenditures in  excluding acquisitions  are expected to total approximately million 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated liquidity requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that the foregoing sources are not sufficient to fund our expenditures and service our indebtedness  we would be required to raise additional funds 
cash flows from discontinued operations the cash flows related to monessen and koppers arch for the two years ended december  have not been restated in the consolidated statement of cash flows

foreign currency transaction gains losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
recently issued accounting guidance there is no recently issued accounting guidance that is expected to have a material impact on the our financial results 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses  assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
our management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or when title passes to the customer 
we recognize revenue related to the procurement of certain untreated railroad crossties upon transfer of title  which occurs upon delivery to our plant and acceptance by the customer 
service revenue  consisting primarily of wood treating services  is 
table of contents recognized at the time the service is provided 
our recognition of revenue with respect to untreated crossties meets all the recognition criteria of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin topic a  including transfer of title and risk of ownership  the existence of fixed purchase commitments and delivery schedules established by the customer and the completion of all performance obligations by us 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
in the united states  cm c and r up inventories are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the last in  first out lifo basis  or market 
inventories outside the united states are valued at the lower of cost  utilizing the first in  first out basis fifo  or market 
market represents replacement cost for raw materials and net realizable value for work in process and finished goods 
lifo inventories constituted approximately percent of the fifo inventory value at december  and long lived assets 
our management periodically evaluates the net realizable value of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  based on a number of factors including operating results  projected future cash flows and business plans 
we record long lived assets at the lower of cost or fair value  with fair value based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of fixed assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated 
goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is assessed for impairment at least on an annual basis 
in making this assessment  management relies on various factors  including operating results  estimated future cash flows  and business plans 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in our management s judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
because management s judgment is involved in performing goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of goodwill is overstated 
goodwill valuations are performed using an average of actual and projected operating results of the relevant reporting units 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairments in future periods 
additionally  disruptions to our business such as prolonged recessionary periods or unexpected significant declines in operating results of the relevant reporting units could result in charges for goodwill and other asset impairments in future periods 
deferred tax assets 
at december  our balance sheet included million of deferred tax assets  net of a million valuation allowance 
we have determined that this valuation allowance is required for our deferred tax assets based on future earnings projections 
to the extent that we encounter unexpected difficulties in market conditions  adverse changes in regulations affecting our businesses and operations  adverse outcomes in legal and environmental matters  or any other unfavorable conditions  the projections for future taxable income may be overstated and we may be required to record an increase in the valuation allowance related to these deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on income in the future 
accrued insurance 
we are insured for property  casualty and workers compensation insurance up to various stop loss amounts after meeting required retention levels 
losses are accrued based upon estimates of the liability for the related retentions for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on our experience 
in the event we incur a significant number of losses beyond the coverage retention limits  additional expense beyond the actuarial projections would be required 
asset retirement obligations 
we measure asset retirement obligations based upon the applicable accounting guidance  using certain assumptions including estimates regarding the recovery of residues in storage tanks 
in the event that operational or regulatory issues vary from our estimates  we could incur additional significant charges to income and increases in cash expenditures related to the disposal of those residues 
pension and postretirement benefits 
accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits involves estimating the cost of benefits to be provided far into the future and allocating that cost over the time period each employee works 
this calculation requires extensive use of assumptions regarding inflation  investment returns  mortality  medical costs  employee turnover and discount rates 
in determining the expected return on plan assets assumptions  we evaluate long term actual 
table of contents koppers holdings inc annual report return information  the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and estimates of future investment returns 
in selecting rates for current and long term health care assumptions  we take into consideration a number of factors including our actual health care cost increases  the design of our benefit programs  the characteristics of our active and retiree populations and expectations of inflation rates 
because these items require our management s judgment  the related liabilities currently recorded by us could be lower or higher than amounts ultimately required to be paid 
litigation contingencies 
we record liabilities related to legal matters when an adverse outcome is probable and reasonably estimable 
to the extent we anticipate favorable outcomes to these matters which ultimately result in adverse outcomes  we could incur material adverse impacts on earnings and cash flows 
because such matters require significant judgments on the part of management  the recorded liabilities could be lower than what is ultimately required 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations and potential liabilities relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety  including  among other things  the cleanup of contaminated sites  the treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  the discharge of effluent into waterways  the emission of substances into the air and various health and safety matters 
we expect to incur substantial costs for ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations 
we may also incur costs as a result of governmental or third party claims  or otherwise incur costs  relating to cleanup of  or for injuries resulting from  contamination at sites associated with past and present operations 
we accrue for environmental liabilities when a determination can be made that they are probable and reasonably estimable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk like other global companies  we are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the objective of our financial risk management is to minimize the negative impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our earnings  cash flows and equity 
to manage the interest rate risks  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
this reduces the impact of short term fluctuations in interest rates 
to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks  we enter into foreign currency debt instruments that are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
this reduces the impact of fluctuating currencies on net income and equity 
we also use forward exchange contracts to hedge firm commitments up to twelve months and all such contracts are marked to market with the recognition of a gain or loss at each reporting period 
the following analyses present the sensitivity of the market value  earnings and cash flows of our financial instruments and foreign operations to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates as if these changes occurred at december  and the range of changes chosen for these analyses reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the interest rate and exchange rate assumptions 
these forward looking statements are selective in nature and only address the potential impacts from financial instruments and foreign operations 
they do not include other potential effects that could impact our business as a result of these changes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity analysis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have both fixed and variable rate debt to manage interest rate risk and to minimize borrowing costs 
at december  we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt  and at december   we had million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt for  including the effect of the interest rate swap 
our ratio of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt at december  was approximately percent  reflecting a slight decrease in the ratio from percent in the previous period 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels and foreign exchange rates  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates at december  and would have increased the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million and million  respectively 
the earnings and cash flows for the next year assuming a one percentage point increase in interest rates would decrease approximately million  holding other variables constant 
exchange rate sensitivity analysis 
our exchange rate exposures result primarily from our investment and ongoing operations in australia  denmark  china and the united kingdom 
holding other variables constant  if there were a ten percent reduction in all relevant exchange rates  the effect on our earnings  based on actual earnings from foreign operations for the years ended december  and  would be reductions of approximately million and million  respectively
