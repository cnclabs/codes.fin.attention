item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of the principal factors affecting the results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  contractual obligations  and the critical accounting policies of franklin covey co 
also referred to as the company  we  us  our  and franklin covey  unless otherwise indicated and subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which contain additional information regarding the accounting policies and estimates underlying the company s financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in item of this report on form k 
franklin covey is a leading global provider of execution  leadership  and personal effectiveness training with over employees worldwide that deliver principle based curriculum and effectiveness tools to our customers 
our training  consulting services  and related accessories are designed to help organizations and individuals transform the way they conduct their business and personal lives to enable them to achieve greatness 
we operate globally with one common brand and business model designed to enable us to provide clients around the world with the same high level of service 
to achieve this level of service  we operate four regional sales offices in the united states  wholly owned subsidiaries in australia  japan  and the united kingdom  and contract with licensee partners who deliver our curr iculum and provide services in over other countries and territories around the world 
our business to business service utilizes our expertise in training  consulting  and technology that is designed to help our clients define great performance and execute at the highest levels 
we also provide clients with training in management skills  relationship skills  and individual effectiveness  and can provide personal effectiveness literature and electronic educational solutions to our clients as needed 
historically  our solutions included products and services that encompassed training and consulting  assessment  and various application tools that were generally available in electronic or paper based formats 
our products and services were available through professional consulting services  public workshops  retail stores  catalogs  and the internet at www 
franklincovey 
com  and our best known offerings in the marketplace have included the franklincovey planner and a suite of individual effectiveness and leadership development training products based on the best selling book the habits of highly effective people 
over the past several years  the strategic focus of our consumer solutions business unit csbu  which was focused primarily on sales of our products  and our organizational solutions business unit osbu  which was focused on the development and delivery of training  consulting  and related services  changed significantly 
as a consequence of these changes in strategic direction  we determined that the extent of overlap between our training and consulting offerings and our products had diminished 
after significant analysis and deliberation  it became apparent that these business units would be able to operate more effectively as separate companies  each with clear and distinct strategic objectives  market definitions  and competitive products and services 
this conclusion persuaded us to sell substantial ly all of the operations of the csbu  and during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended august   we completed the sale of the csbu to a newly formed entity  franklin covey products  llc 
following the sale of the csbu  we have been able to focus our full resources on the continued expansion of our training  consulting  content rich media  and thought leadership businesses 
our business now primarily consists of training  consulting  assessment services  and products to help organizations and individuals achieve superior results by focusing on and executing on top priorities  building the capability of knowledge workers  and aligning business processes 
the sale of the csbu had a significant impact on our financial statements since the csbu and corresponding product sales represented a substantial portion of our total sales  and the business dynamics of a training company are considerably different than a consumer products company 
based on relevant accounting 
table of contents literature  we were unable to present the operational results of the csbu in a discontinued operations format  which makes comparisons of fiscal and fiscal financial results to fiscal results difficult 
the key factors that influence our operating results include the number of organizations that are active customers  the number of people trained within those organizations  the availability of budgeted training spending at our clients and prospective clients  which is significantly influenced by general economic conditions  and our ability to manage operating costs necessary to develop and provide meaningful training and related products to our clients 
our fiscal year ends on august  and unless otherwise indicated  fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal refer to the twelve month periods ended august    and and so forth 
results of operations overview of the fiscal year ended august  our operating results for fiscal marked a significant improvement over fiscal financial results 
we believe that slowly stabilizing economic conditions in the united states  and in many of the countries which we operate  helped to improve corporate earnings and increase training budgets at many of our existing and newly acquired clients 
during fiscal we experienced broad based improvements in our training and consulting sales at nearly all of our regional offices and directly owned international offices as well as from most of our international licensees 
nearly all of our major practices and content groups had increased sales and we believe that our investments in curriculum development will allow us to maintain this favorable momentum 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal we were awarded a contract to provide training and consulting services to a governmental entity  which significantly improved our sales in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year 
we started fiscal with approximately million more in our pipeline of booked days and awarded revenue at august  to be delivered in future periods compared to the same time last year 
we believe that the combination of stablized economic conditions and increased booked training days as we enter fiscal will enable us to achieve improved financial results in fiscal during fiscal  we sold the product sales component of our wholly owned subsidiary in japan to an unrelated japan based paper products company 
the sale included the disposition of inventories  certain intangibles assets  and other current assets 
the sale closed on june   and the total sale price was jpy million  or approximately million 
in addition  the sale agreement provides for a three percent passive royalty on annual sales  which we believe will not be significant to our future operations 
we believe that the sale of this division will further align our japanese operations with our overall strategic focus on training and consulting sales 
as a consequence of the sale  we determined that the operating results of the japan product sales component qualified for discontinued operations presentation  and we have presented the operating results of the japan product sales component as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report on form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis is presented on a comparative continuing operations presentation as shown in our consolidated statements of operations  which is found in item for the year ended august   our consolidated sales from continuing operations increased percent to million compared to million in fiscal increased sales and an improved gross margin percentage contributed to improved operating results and in fiscal we recognized income from operations of million compared to a loss from operations of million in fiscal our income from continuing operations before taxes was million  compared to a loss of million in fiscal we recorded a million income tax provision refer to discussion below during fiscal compared to a million income tax benefit in the prior year  primarily due to increased pre tax earnings 
after accounting for discontinued operations  our net loss for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to a million loss  or per share  recognized in fiscal 
table of contents the following information is intended to provide an overview of the primary factors that influenced our financial results for the fiscal year ended august  sales performance our consolidated sales from continuing operations increased million  or percent  compared to fiscal we continue to be encouraged by revenue growth from our government services group  in our practices  at most of our us canadian regional sales offices  from our international licensee partners  and from our directly owned offices in australia and the united kingdom 
growth in these areas was partially offset by decreased sales in japan 
sales in japan were impacted by an intellectual property licensing arrangement in fiscal that did not repeat in fiscal and by weak economic conditions in that country 
looking forward  our bookin g pace continues to improve over the prior year  and in fiscal we were awarded several training contracts that had a favorable impact on the fourth quarter of fiscal and which we believe will strengthen sales during fiscal gross profit consolidated gross profit increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal primarily due to increased sales as described above 
our gross margin  which is gross profit stated as a percentage of sales  improved to percent compared to percent in the prior year 
operating costs our operating costs decreased by million compared to fiscal  which was the net result of a million increase in selling  general  and administrative costs  a million decrease in restructuring costs  a million decrease in impaired asset charges  and a million decrease in depreciation expense 
during fiscal  we did not initiate a restructuring plan or have impaired asset charges 
income taxes our income tax provision attributed to continuing operations for the fiscal year ended august  totaled million on pre tax earnings of million 
our effective tax rate on continuing operations of approximately percent is higher than statutory combined rates primarily due to foreign withholding taxes for which we cannot utilize a foreign tax credit  the accrual of taxable interest income on the management stock loan program  disallowed executive compensation  and actual and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries for which we also cannot utilize foreign tax credits 
these items and other differences added approximately million to our income tax provision for fiscal however  due to the utiliz ation of net operating loss carryforwards  our income tax expense is not indicative of the actual cash paid for income taxes 
further details regarding these items can be found in the comparative analysis of fiscal compared to fiscal as discussed in this management s discussion and analysis 
the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentage of total sales represented by the line items through income or loss before income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations year ended august  sales training and consulting services products leasing total sales cost of sales training and consulting services products leasing total cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative gain on sale of csbu restructuring costs impairment of assets depreciation amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense income loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal sales we offer a variety of training courses  consulting services  and training related products that are focused on leadership  productivity  strategy execution  sales force performance  trust  and effective communications that are provided both domestically and internationally through our sales force or through international licensee partners 
the following table sets forth sales data from continuing operations by category and by our primary delivery channels in thousands year ended august  percent change from prior year percent change from prior year sales by category training and consulting services products leasing sales by channel us canada direct international direct international licensees national account practices self funded marketing other csbu channels our consolidated sales increased by million  or percent  compared to fiscal the following analysis of our sales performance for the fiscal year ended august  is based on activity through our primary delivery channels as shown above 
us canada direct this channel includes our four regional field offices that serve our clients in the united states and canada and our government services group 
during fiscal  we had improved sales performance in this channel primarily due to increased sales from our government services group  improved sales at three of our four regional offices  increased revenue per training day  and decreased cancellation rates compared to fiscal sales through our government services group increased primarily due to a governmental services contract obtained during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recognized million from this contract during the fourth quarter of fiscal sales through our regional s ales offices increased million compared to fiscal 
table of contents and bookings are currently strong for the first quarter of fiscal international direct our three directly owned international offices are located in australia  japan  and the united kingdom 
the decrease in international direct sales was due to reduced sales in japan  which declined million on a continuing operations basis compared to fiscal this decrease was partially offset by sales increases in australia and the united kingdom 
sales in japan were impacted by a million intellectual property sale in fiscal that did not repeat in fiscal and by economic conditions in that country 
we believe that continued economic weakness in japan was the primary factor in decreased sales  which resulted in decreased training and consulting sales and decreased boo k publishing sales compared to fiscal international licensees in countries or foreign locations where we do not have a directly owned office  our training and consulting services are delivered through independent licensees  which may translate and adapt our curriculum to local preferences and customs  if necessary 
during the fiscal year ended august   nearly all of our foreign licensees had increased sales compared to the prior year 
we believe that increased licensee royalties were indicative of stabilizing economic conditions in many countries around the world 
national account practices our national account practices are comprised of programs that are not typically offered in our regional field offices and includes helping clients succeed from the sales performance group  the leader in me curriculum designed for students from our education practice  and winning customer loyalty from our customer loyalty practice 
during fiscal  each of our major components of this channel had increased sales compared to the prior year 
self funded marketing this group includes our public programs  book and audio sales  and speeches 
the decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased speeches delivered and reduced public program sales resulting from the decision to offer fewer programs during the fiscal year 
other our other sales are comprised primarily of leasing and shipping and handling revenues 
the decrease in other sales was primarily due to reduced leasing revenues as certain lease contracts at our corporate headquarters expired 
we are actively seeking new tenants for available property and believe that we will be successful in attracting new tenants to occupy vacant space at our corporate campus 
gross profit gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of services provided or the cost of goods sold 
our cost of sales includes the direct costs of conducting seminars  materials used in the production of training products and related accessories  assembly and manufacturing labor costs  freight  and certain other overhead costs 
gross profit may be affected by  among other things  the mix of training and consulting courses provided  prices of materials  labor rates  changes in product discount levels  production efficiency  and freight costs 
our consolidated gross profit from continuing operations increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal our consolidated gross margin  which is gross profit stated in terms of a percentage of sales  was percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal gross margin on our training and consulting sales  which represented approximately percent of our consolidated sales in fiscal  was percent compared to percent in fiscal the increase was primarily due to sales from a government services contract that included intellectual property  which have higher margins than other types of training and consulting sales  increased international licensee royalty revenues  which have virtually no cost of sales  and an increase in training and consulting sales as 
table of contents a percent of our consolidated sales as training and consulting sales generally have higher gross margins than product or leasing sales 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative our selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses increased by million compared to the prior year 
however  as a percent of sales  consolidated sg a expense decreased to percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to increased sales and the corresponding increase in commissions  severance costs  reimbursement of airfare costs previously paid by the company s ceo for business travel  and costs associated with the forgiveness of certain management stock loans 
due to the significant increase in sales during our fourth quar ter of fiscal  our commissions also increased as many of our sales personnel substantially exceeded sales goals  which provides for special bonus compensation 
however  as our sales performance improves  annual sales goals are adjusted higher  which we believe provides incentive for continued growth 
of the million increase in associate costs  we believe that million was attributable to these special commissions 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  it was mutually determined that our co chief operating officers would terminate their employment with the company 
as a result of this decision  we paid the former co chief operating officers severance according to our corporate policy  which totaled million 
during fiscal we also expensed million for the reimbursement of airfare costs previously paid by the company s ceo for business travel pursuant to a change in policy approved by the board of directors 
 we also expensed million related to bonuses for the income tax consequences resulting from the forgiveness of certain management stock loans during the fiscal year 
in previous fiscal years  we have implemented cost reduction efforts that reduced virtually every aspect of our spending 
these initiatives included a restructuring plan that reduced the number of our domestic regional sales offices  decentralized certain sales support functions  reduced our headcount  closed our canadian office  and made other changes to our operations in canada 
increased sg a expenses as described above were partially offset by the decreases in the following areas our advertising and promotional expenses decreased million primarily due to the decision to reduce the number of public programs held and strategic reductions in our overall marketing expenses  our telephone and overall utility charges decreased by million primarily due to cost savings initiatives  our spending on computer  office  and other related items declined by million  and we experienced reduced expenses in various other areas of our operations resulting from our cost cutting efforts 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased million compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to impaired accounting software costs that resulted in an additional million depreciation charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal which did not repeat in fiscal and the full depreciation of other capital assets during the year 
based upon anticipated capital asset acquisitions in fiscal and previous depreciation expense levels  we expect depreciation expense to total approximately million during fiscal amortization amortization expense from definite lived intangible assets was flat compared to the prior year 
we currently expect that intangible asset amortization expense will total million in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales training and consulting services and leasing continuing channels our consolidated training and consulting service sales decreased by million compared to the prior year  which was attributable to unfavorable performance from the majority of our domestic and international delivery channels 
we 
table of contents believe that the decrease in sales was primarily due to unfavorable economic conditions  which eroded business confidence and led to decreased training budgets and the deferral of scheduled programs 
the effects of the economic downturn were widespread and led to economic contraction and reduced sales in many countries where we operate through direct offices or through our licensees 
these conditions led to the following results in our primary delivery channels us canada direct during fiscal  our sales decreased at all of our regional offices  primarily due to the economic factors described above 
these factors led to cancelations or deferral of scheduled programs  reduced on site training days  and overall decreased sales 
partially offsetting decreased sales at our regional offices was improved government services sales  which increased million compared to fiscal international direct consistent with sales performance in the united states  sales at all of our directly owned international offices declined compared to fiscal in addition  the translation of foreign sales was adversely affected by changes in the exchange rates as these sales were translated to united states dollars 
the translation of foreign sales to united states dollars had a net million unfavorable impact on our consolidated sales during the fiscal year ended august  international licensees during the fiscal year ended august   nearly all of our foreign licensees had decreased sales compared to the prior year 
we believe that decreased licensee royalties were indicative of deteriorating economic conditions in many countries around the world throughout late and the majority of fiscal national account practices our national account practices are comprised of programs that are not typically offered in our regional field offices and includes helping clients succeed from the sales performance group  the leader in me curriculum designed for students from our education practice  and winning customer loyalty from our customer loyalty practice 
during fiscal  each of our major components of this channel had increased sales compared to the prior year primarily because most of these offerings were relatively new to the marketplace and gained momentum in fiscal self funded marketing this group includes our public programs  book and audio sales  and speeches 
the decrease in sales was primarily due to reduced public seminar sales resulting from the decision to reduce the number of events scheduled during the year and from the decision to license the delivery rights of certain public programs to a third party  which resulted in the company recording a licensee fee from these programs rather than the gross sale amount previously recorded  and lower books and audio sales as fiscal sales were favorably impacted by the release of the leader in me book by dr 
stephen r 
covey 
other our other sales are comprised primarily of leasing and shipping and handling revenues 
the improvement over fiscal was due to increased leasing sales totaling million primarily due to the addition of new leasing contracts that are generated from various arrangements to lease office space at our salt lake city  utah headquarters campus 
product sales primarily csbu channels consolidated product sales  which were primarily sold through our csbu channels  declined million compared to the prior year primarily due to the sale of our csbu during the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit prior to the sale of csbu assets in fiscal  we recorded the costs associated with operating our retail stores  call center  and internet site as part of our consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses 
therefore  our consolidated gross profit may not be comparable with the gross profit of other companies that include similar costs in their cost of sales 

table of contents our consolidated gross profit decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to decreased product sales resulting from the sale of the csbu 
our consolidated gross margin from continuing operations was percent of sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
our training and consulting services gross margin was percent compared to percent in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased licensee royalty revenues  which have virtually no corresponding cost of sales  increased royalty costs on certain programs sold  and increased amortization of capitalized curriculum development costs 
gross margin on product sales decreased to percent compared to percent in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the csbu  which eliminated virtually all of our domestic product sales 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative our sg a expenses decreased million compared to the prior year 
the decrease in sg a expenses was primarily due to the sale of the csbu  which reduced consolidated sg a by approximately million compared to the prior year  a million decrease in compensation costs resulting from lower sales and corresponding reductions to commissions and other variable compensation elements  a million decrease in advertising costs  primarily related to a decrease in the number of public programs held  million of reduced travel and conference costs  primarily due to the cancellation of our annual sales and delivery conferen ce and focused cost cutting measures  and the favorable impacts of our restructuring plan on various areas of our operations 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased warehousing costs that were previously charged to csbu cost centers  and million of increased share based compensation costs due to reversals of share based compensation expense in the prior year that did not repeat in fiscal restructuring costs following the sale of our csbu  we initiated a restructuring plan that reduced the number of our domestic regional sales offices  decentralized certain sales support functions  and significantly changed the operations of our canadian subsidiary 
the restructuring plan was intended to strengthen the remaining domestic sales offices and reduce our overall operating costs  and this effort continued into fiscal during fiscal we expensed million for anticipated severance costs necessary to complete the restructuring plan 
impairment of assets based on the terms of the sale of csbu assets  we were entitled to receive a million adjustment for working capital delivered on the closing date of the sale and to receive million as reimbursement for specified costs necessary to complete the transaction 
payment for these costs was originally due in january  but we extended the due date of the payment at franklin covey products request and obtained a promissory note from franklin covey products for the amount owed  plus accrued interest 
at the time we received the promissory note from franklin covey products  we believed that we could obtain payment for the amounts owed  based on prior year performance and forecasted financial performance in however  the financial position of franklin covey products deteriorated significantly late in fiscal and the deterioration accelerated subsequent to august  as a result of this deterioration  the company reassessed the collectibility of the promissory note 
based on revised expected cash flows and other operational issues  we determined that the promissory note should be impaired at august  accordingly  we recorded a million impaired asset charge and reversed million of interest income that was recorded during fiscal from the working capital settlement and reimbursable transaction cost receivables 
depreciation depreciation expense decreased by million compared to the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to the sale of the csbu 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we impaired certain software costs due to the decision to replace our primary general ledger accounting 
table of contents system in fiscal and recorded an additional million depreciation charge 
we also recorded impairment charges totaling million for two software applications that did not function as anticipated and were written off during fiscal amortization consolidated amortization expense increased by million compared to the prior year due to the acquisition of coveylink  which was purchased in fiscal income taxes our income tax benefit from continuing operations for fiscal was million compared to a million provision in fiscal the income tax benefit was primarily due to a pre tax loss recognized in fiscal compared to pre tax income in the prior year 
our effective tax benefit rate of approximately percent was lower than statutory combined rates primarily due to foreign withholding taxes for which we cannot utilize a foreign tax credit  the accrual of taxable interest income on the management stock loan program  and actual and deemed dividends from foreign subsidiaries for which we also cannot utilize foreign tax credits 
segment review prior to the sale of the csbu  we had two operating segments the osbu and the csbu 
following the sale  our operations constitute one reportable segment 
however  to improve comparability  the amounts presented in the table below reflect fiscal operating results based upon the previously defined segments and include the impact of the sale of the csbu  which closed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the following is a description of the previously reported operating segments  their primary operating components  and their significant business activities organizational solutions business unit the osbu was primarily responsible for the development  marketing  sale  and delivery of strategic execution  productivity  leadership  sales force performance  and communication training and consulting solutions directly to organizational clients  including other companies  the government  and educational institutions 
the osbu included the financial results of our domestic sales force  public programs  and certain international operations 
the domestic sales force remains responsible for the sale and delivery of our training and consulting services in the united states and canada 
our international sales group includes the financial results of our directly owned foreign offices and royalty revenues from licensees 
consumer solutions business unit this business unit was primarily focused on sales to individual customers and small business organizations and included the results of our domestic retail stores  consumer direct operations primarily internet sales and call center  wholesale operations  international product channels in certain countries  and other related distribution channels  including government product sales and domestic printing and publishing sales 
the csbu results of operations also included the financial results of our paper planner manufacturing operations 
although csbu sales primarily consisted of products such as planners  binders  software  totes  and related accessories  virtually any component of our leadership  pro ductivity  and strategy execution solutions may have been purchased through the csbu channels

table of contents training sales are moderately seasonal because of the timing of corporate training  which is not typically scheduled as heavily during holiday and vacation periods 
quarterly fluctuations may also be affected by other factors including the introduction of new offerings  the addition of new organizational customers  and the elimination of underperforming offerings 
liquidity and capital resources summary at august  we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at august  and our net working capital current assets less current liabilities increased significantly to million compared to a deficit of million at august  our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from the sale of services in the normal course of business and proceeds from our revolving line of credit 
our primary uses of liquidity include payments for operating activities  capital expenditures  working capital  and debt repayment 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we obtained a modification to our existing line of credit facility the fourth modification 
the fourth modification agreement affected the following terms of our existing line of credit agreements loan amount the line of credit will continue to allow up to million of borrowing capacity until december   when the loan amount will be reduced to million 
maturity date the maturity date of the credit facility has been extended one year to march  interest rate the effective interest rate will be based upon the calculation of the funded debt to ebitdar ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio 
if our funded debt to ebitdar ratio is less than to and the fixed charge coverage ratio is greater than to  the interest rate will be libor plus percent 
if the ratios are in excess of these amounts  but still in compliance with the terms of the line of credit facility  the interest rate will be libor plus percent 
financial covenants the funded debt to ebitdar ratio was modified for the twelve month periods to be less than a to as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending on february   b to as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending on may   and c to as of the end of the fiscal quarter ending on august  and each fiscal quarter thereafter 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is required to be greater than to for all periods and the minimum net worth was revised to million 
the capital expenditure limitations remain unchanged 
we may use the line of credit facility for general corporate purposes as well as for other transactions  unless specifically prohibited by the terms of the line of credit agreement 
the line of credit also contains customary representations and guarantees as well as provisions for repayment and liens 
at august   we had million outstanding on our line of credit 
in addition to customary non financial terms and conditions  our line of credit requires us to be in compliance with specified financial covenants  as described above 
in the event of noncompliance with these financial covenants and other defined events of default  the lenders are entitled to certain remedies  including acceleration of the repayment of amounts outstanding on the line of credit 
at august   we believe that we were in compliance with the terms and financial covenants of our line of credit facility 

table of contents in addition to our million line of credit facility  we have a long term lease on our corporate campus that is accounted for as a long term financing obligation 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the past three years in thousands year ended august  total cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents the following discussion is a description of the primary factors affecting our cash flows and their effects upon our liquidity and capital resources during the fiscal year ended august  cash flows from operating activities our cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal the increase was primarily due to improved operating results from increased sales during fiscal compared to the prior year 
our primary source of cash from operating activities was the sale of goods and services to our customers in the normal course of business 
the primary uses of cash for operating activities were payments to suppliers for materials used in products sold  payments for direct costs necessary to conduct training programs  and payments for selling  general  and administrative expenses 
cash provided by or used for changes in working capital during fiscal was primarily related to increased accounts receivable resulting from significantly increased sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  increased accrued liabilities resulting primarily from increased sales and a corresponding increase in commissions and bonuses  and reduced inventory balances resulting from improved forecasting and purchasing processes 
we continue to strive to optimize our working capital balances by  among other things  improving our collections of accounts receivable  maintaining proper levels of inventory  and control spending for prepaid and other assets 
combined with existing and future sales growth programs and cost reduction initiatives  we hope to improve our cash flows from operating activities in future periods 
however  the success of these efforts  and their eventual contribution to our cash flows  is dependent upon numerous factors  many of which are not within our control 
cash flows from investing activities and capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended august  we used million of net cash for investing activities 
our primary uses of cash for investing activities were the payment of the first of five potential earnout payments to the former owners of coveylink  purchases of property and equipment  and additional spending on curriculum development 
during fiscal  we paid million to the former owners of coveylink based on earnings growth over the specified earnings period 
the former owners of coveylink include a son of our vice chairman of the board of directors 
our purchases of property and equipment  which totaled million  consisted primarily of computer hardware and software 
during fiscal  we also spent million for further investment in curriculum development acti vities 
these uses of cash were partially offset by the receipt of million from the sale of our product sales component of our japan subsidiary 

table of contents during fiscal  we expect to spend approximately million on purchases of property and equipment and million on curriculum development activities 
purchases of property and equipment are expected to consist primarily of new computer hardware  software  and in other areas as deemed necessary 
however  actual capital spending is based upon a variety of factors and may differ from these estimates 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used for financing activities during the fiscal year ended august  totaled million 
our uses of cash for financing activities primarily consisted of million of cash used to reduce our line of credit balance and million used for principal payments on our financing obligation 
these uses were partially offset by million of cash received from participants in the employee stock purchase plan to purchase shares of our common stock  and million of cash received from a management stock loan participant to repay their loan 
sources of liquidity going forward  we will continue to incur costs necessary for the operation and potential growth of the business 
we anticipate using cash on hand  cash provided by the sale of goods and services to our clients on the condition that we can continue to generate positive cash flows from operating activities  proceeds from our line of credit  and other financing alternatives  if necessary  for these expenditures 
in order to obtain a more favorable interest rate on the line of credit facility  the facility requires an annual renewal 
we currently believe that we will be successful in obtaining a new or extended line of credit from our lender prior to the expiration of the current credit facility in march to ensure available liquidity in future periods 
additional potential sources of liquidity include factoring receivables  issuance of additional equity  or issuance of debt from public or private sources 
however  no assurance can be provided that we will obtain a new or extended line of credit or obtain additional financing from other sources on terms that would be acceptable to us 
if necessary  we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the associated cost of capital 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining a renewal or extension of our line of credit  or additional financing  we believe that cash flows from operations combined with a number of initiatives we would implement in the months preceding the due date would create sufficient liquidity to pay down the required outstanding balance on the line of credit 
these initiatives include deferral of capital purchases for externally developed curriculum and uncommitted capital expenditures  deferral of executive team compensation  deferral of certain related party contractual earnout payments  substantial reduction of associate salaries  reduction of operating expenses  including non critical travel  and deferral of payments to other vendors in order to generate sufficient cash 
considering the foregoing  we anticipate that our existing capital resources should be adequate to enable us to maintain our operations for at least the upcoming twelve months 
however  our ability to maintain adequate capital for our operations in the future is dependent upon a number of factors  including sales trends  our ability to contain costs  levels of capital expenditures  collection of accounts receivable  and other factors 
some of the factors that influence our operations are not within our control  such as economic conditions and the introduction of new technology and products by our competitors 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity position and may pursue additional financing alternatives  as described above  to maintain sufficient resources for future growth and capital requirements 
 however  there can be no assurance such financing alternatives will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations the company has not structured any special purpose or variable interest entities  or participated in any commodity trading activities  which would expose us to potential undisclosed liabilities or create adverse consequences to our liquidity 
required contractual payments primarily consist of lease payments resulting from the sale of our corporate campus financing obligation  payments to hp enterprise services hp for outsourcing services related to information systems  warehousing  and distribution services  minimum rent payments for office and warehouse space  the repayment of our line of credit 
table of contents obligation  which matures in fiscal  and short term purchase obligations for inventory items and other products and services used in the ordinary course of business 
our expected payments on these obligations over the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal contractual obligations thereafter total required lease payments on corporate campus minimum required payments to hp for outsourcing services minimum operating lease payments line of credit purchase obligations total expected contractual obligation payments our obligation for outsourcing services contains an annual escalation based upon changes in the employment cost index  the impact of which was not estimated in the above table 
we are also contractually allowed to collect amounts from franklin covey products that reduce the amounts shown in the table above 
the operating agreement with franklin covey products provides for reimbursement of a portion of the warehouse leasing costs  the impact of which is not included in the lease obligations in the table above 
our contractual obligations presented above exclude unrecognized tax benefits of million for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment 
for further information regarding the application of fasc  refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements as presented in item of this report on form k 
other items franklin covey products is contractually obligated to pay us for rented warehouse and office space  a portion of the fixed costs for warehousing and distribution facilities  and is primarily liable for leasing costs at its retail stores 
in the event that franklin covey products is unable to pay these items  our cash flows and operating results may be adversely affected 
the company is the creditor for a loan program that provided the capital to allow certain management personnel the opportunity to purchase shares of our common stock 
for further information regarding our management common stock loan program  refer to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as found in item of this report on form k 
the inability of the company to collect all  or a portion  of these receivables could have an adverse impact upon our financial position and future cash flows compared to full collection of the loans 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the significant accounting polices that we used to prepare our consolidated financial statements are primarily outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements  which are presented in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require us to make assumptions and use judgments that may affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions and bases those estimates and assumptions on historical experience  factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  including changes in economic and political conditions and other circumstances that are not in our control  but which may have an impact on these estimates and our actual financial results 
the following items require the most significant judgment and often involve complex estimates 
table of contents revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the following sources training and consulting services we provide training and consulting services to both organizations and individuals in leadership  productivity  strategic execution  goal alignment  sales force performance  and communication effectiveness skills 
products we sold planners  binders  planner accessories  handheld electronic devices  and other related products that were primarily delivered through our csbu channels prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal we continue to sell products  such as books  audio products  and other related items 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery of product has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for training and service sales  these conditions are generally met upon presentation of the training seminar or delivery of the consulting services 
for product sales  these conditions were generally met upon shipment of the product to the customer or by completion of the sales transaction in a retail store 
some of our training and consulting contracts contain multiple deliverable elements that include training along with other products and services 
for transactions that contain more than one element  we recognize revenue in accordance with the guidance for multiple element arrangements 
when fair value exists for all contracted elements  the overall contract consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based upon their relative fair values 
revenue for these units is recognized in accordance with our general revenue policies once it has been determined that the delivered items have standalone value to the customer 
if fair value does not exist for all contracted elements  revenue for the delivered items is recognized us ing the residual method  which generally means that revenue recognition is postponed until the point is reached when the delivered items have standalone value and fair value exists for the undelivered items 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue considered for recognition under our general revenue policies is the total contract amount  less the aggregate fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value of the undelivered items is based upon the normal pricing practices for our existing training programs  consulting services  and other products  which are generally the prices of the items when sold separately 
our international strategy includes the use of licensees in countries where we do not have a wholly owned operation 
licensee companies are unrelated entities that have been granted a license to translate our content and curriculum  adapt the content and curriculum to the local culture  and sell our training seminars and products in a specific country or region 
licensees are required to pay us royalties based upon a percentage of their sales to clients 
we recognize royalty income each period based upon the sales information reported to us from our licensees 
royalty revenue is reported as a component of training and consulting service sales in our consolidated statements of operations 
revenue is recognized as the net amount to be received after deducting estimated amounts for discounts and product returns 
share based compensation our shareholders have approved a performance based long term incentive plan the ltip that provides for annual grants of share based performance awards to certain managerial personnel and executive management as directed by the organization and compensation committee the compensation committee of the board of directors 
the number of common shares that are vested and issued to ltip participants is variable and is based entirely upon the achievement of specified financial performance objectives during a defined performance period 
due to the variable number of common shares that may be issued under the ltip  we reevaluate our ltip grants on a quarterly basis and adjust the number of shares expected to be awarded based upon actual and estimated financial results of the 
table of contents company compared to the performance goals set for the award 
adjustments to the number of shares awarded  and to the corresponding compensation expense  are made on a cumulative basis at the adjustment date based upon the estimated probable number of common shares to be awarded 
the analysis of our ltip awards contain uncertainties because we are required to make assumptions and judgments about the eventual number of shares that will vest in each ltip grant 
the assumptions and judgments that are essential to the analysis include forecasted sales and operating income levels during the ltip service periods 
the evaluation of ltip performance awards and the corresponding use of estimated amounts may produce additional volatility in our consolidated financial statements as we record cumulative adjustments to the estimated number of common shares to be awarded under the ltip grants as described above 
during fiscal we granted options to purchase shares of our common stock that have a share price  or market based  vesting condition 
as a result  we used a monte carlo simulation to determine the fair value of these stock options 
the monte carlo option pricing model required the input of subjective assumptions  including items such as the expected term of the options 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense related to stock options  our share based compensation expense may differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
accounts receivable valuation trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write off experience and current economic conditions and we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis 
receivable balances over days past due  which exceed a specified dollar amount  are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the probability for recovery is considered remote 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure relat ed to our customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the collectibility of customer accounts  which may be influenced by a number of factors that are not within our control  such as the financial health of each customer 
we regularly review the collectibility assumptions of our allowance for doubtful accounts calculation and compare them against historical collections 
adjustments to the assumptions may either increase or decrease our total allowance for doubtful accounts 
for example  a percent increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts at august  would increase our reported loss from operations by approximately million 
inventory valuation following the sale of csbu  our inventories are comprised primarily of training materials and training related accessories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are reduced to their fair market value through the use of inventory loss reserves  which are recorded during the normal course of business 
our inventory loss reserve calculations contain uncertainties because the calculations require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding a number of factors  including future inventory demand requirements and pricing strategies 
during the evaluation process we consider historical sales patterns and current sales trends  but these may not be indicative of future inventory losses 
while we have not made material changes to our inventory reserves methodology during the past three years  our inventory requirements may change based on projected customer demand  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods  and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand and other factors are inaccurate  we may b e exposed to losses that may have a materially adverse impact upon our financial position and results of 
table of contents operations 
for example  a percent increase to our inventory reserves at august  would increase our reported loss from operations by million 
indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life and goodwill balances are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists 
the covey trade name intangible asset was generated by the merger with the covey leadership center and has been deemed to have an indefinite life 
this intangible asset is tested for impairment using the present value of estimated royalties on trade name related revenues  which consist primarily of training seminars and international licensee royalties 
our goodwill at august  was generated by the acquisition of coveylink during the second quarter of fiscal and the subsequent payment of the first of five potential earnout payments contained in the acqui sition agreement 
our impairment evaluation calculations for goodwill and the covey trade name contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  to estimate an appropriate royalty rate  and to select a discount rate that reflects the inherent risk of future cash flows 
our valuation methodology for the covey trade name has remained unchanged during the past three years 
however  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible asset change in future periods  significant impairment charges could result that would have an adverse effect upon our results of operations and financial condition 
the valuation methodologies for both indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill are also dependent upon  the share price of our common stock and corresponding market capitalization  which may differ from estimated royalties used in our annual impairment testing 
based upon the fiscal evaluation of the covey trade name and goodwill  our trade name related revenues  licensee royalties  and overall sales levels would have to suffer significant reductions before we would be required to impair them 
however  future declines in our share price may trigger additional impairment testing and may result in impairment charges 
impairment of long lived assets long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of the assets over their remaining useful lives in determining whether the carrying value of the assets is recoverable 
if the carrying values of the assets exceed the anticipated future cash flows of the assets  we calculate an impairment loss 
the impairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to the asset s estimated fair value  which may be based upon discounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset 
if we recognize an impairment loss  the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis  which is then depreciated or amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
impairment of long lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent from other groups of assets 
our impairment evaluation calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and apply judgment in order to estimate future cash flows  forecast the useful lives of the assets  and select a discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
although we have not made any material changes to our long lived assets impairment assessment methodology during the past three years  if forecasts and assumptions used to support the carrying value of our long lived tangible and definite lived intangible assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we regularly evaluate our united states federal and various state and foreign jurisdiction income tax exposures 
we account for certain aspects of our income tax provision using the provisions of fasc 
table of contents formerly fin  which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon final settlement 
the provisions of fasc also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest  and penalties on income taxes  accounting for income taxes in interim periods  and require incre ased disclosure of various income tax items 
taxes and penalties are components of our overall income tax provision 
we record previously unrecognized tax benefits in the financial statements when it becomes more likely than not greater than a percent likelihood that the tax position will be sustained 
to assess the probability of sustaining a tax position  we consider all available evidence 
in many instances  sufficient positive evidence may not be available until the expiration of the statute of limitations for audits by taxing jurisdictions  at which time the entire benefit will be recognized as a discrete item in the applicable period 
our unrecognized tax benefits result from uncertain tax positions about which we are required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions 
the calculation of our income tax provision or benefit  as applicable  requires estimates of future taxable income or losses 
during the course of the fiscal year  these estimates are compared to actual financial results and adjustments may be made to our tax provision or benefit to reflect these revised estimates 
our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law and the results of tax audits by various jurisdictions 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we could be exposed to losses or gai ns that could be material 
accounting pronouncements issued not yet adopted revenue recognition in october  the financial accounting standards board issued guidance on revenue recognition that will be effective for us beginning september  the new guidance amends existing guidance on multiple element revenue arrangements to improve the ability of entities to recognize revenue from the sale of delivered items that are part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
one of the current requirements is that there must be objective and reliable evidence of the standalone selling price of the undelivered items  which must be supported by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence tpe 
the new guidance eliminates the requirements th at all undelivered elements have vsoe or tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement that is attributable to items that have already been delivered 
the residual method of allocating revenue is thereby eliminated and entities are required to allocate the arrangement consideration at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we have not completed our evaluation of the impact of this guidance 
regulatory compliance the company is registered in states in which we do business that have a sales tax and collects and remits sales or use tax on retail sales made through its stores and catalog sales 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations 
inflation and changing prices inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
however  future inflation may have an impact on the price of materials used in the production of training products and related accessories  including paper and related raw materials 
we may not be able to pass on such increased costs to our customers

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk of financial instruments we are exposed to financial instrument market risk primarily through fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to manage risks associated with foreign currency exchange and interest rates  we make limited use of derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from one or more underlying financial instruments 
as a matter of policy  our derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions that are independent of those exposures 
in addition  we do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the notional amounts of derivatives do not represent actual amounts exchanged by the parties to the instrument  and  thus  are not a measure of exposure to us through our use of derivatives 
additionally  we enter into derivative agreements only with highly rated counterparties and we do not expect to incur any losses resulting from non performance by other parties 
foreign exchange sensitivity due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to risks associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar  as well as the effects of translating amounts denominated in foreign currencies to united states dollars as a normal part of the reporting process 
the objective of our foreign currency risk management activities is to reduce foreign currency risk in the consolidated financial statements 
in order to manage foreign currency risks  we make limited use of foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency related derivative instruments 
although we cannot eliminate all aspects of our foreign currency risk  we believe that our strategy  which includes the use of derivative instruments  can reduce the impacts of foreign currency rela ted issues on our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a description of our use of foreign currency derivative instruments 
foreign currency forward contracts during the fiscal years ended august    and  we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of certain intercompany financing transactions and other transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
because these contracts did not meet specific hedge accounting requirements  gains and losses on these contracts  which expired on a quarterly basis  were recognized in current operations and were used to offset a portion of the gains or losses of the related accounts 
the gains and losses on these contracts were recorded as a component of sg a expense in our consolidated statements of operations and had the followi ng net impact on the periods indicated in thousands year ended august  losses on foreign exchange contracts gains on foreign exchange contracts net loss on foreign exchange contracts at august   we had one open foreign currency sell contract that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
the notional amount of this contract was jpy million with a contracted value of million 
the fair value of this foreign currency forward contract  which was determined using the estimated amount at which the contract could be settled based upon forward market exchange rates  was insignificant 

table of contents interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily due to our line of credit borrowings 
at august   our debt obligations consisted primarily of a long term lease agreement financing obligation associated with the sale of our corporate headquarters facility and a variable rate line of credit arrangement 
our overall interest rate sensitivity is primarily influenced by amounts borrowed on the line of credit and the prevailing interest rates  which may create additional expense if interest rates increase in future periods 
the financing obligation has a payment structure equivalent to a long term leasing arrangement with a fixed interest rate of percent and the line of credit obligation had an effective interest rate of percent at august  at august  borrowing levels  a one percent increase in the interest rate on our variable rate line of credit obligation would increase our interest expense over the next year by approximately million 
during the fiscal years ended august    and  we were not party to any interest rate swap agreements or similar derivative instruments
