item a 
risk factors related to our business and operations our business activities and the value of our securities are subject to significant risk factors  including those described below 
the risk factors described below could negatively affect our operations  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  and as a result  holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments 
it is possible additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus supplement if we issue securities in the future 
commodity price risk our estimated proved reserves  revenue  operating cash flows  operating margins  future earnings and trading operations are highly dependent on the prices of crude oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products  which are influenced by numerous factors beyond our control 
historically these prices have been very volatile and most recently have been affected by changes in demand associated with the global economic downturn 
the major foreign oil producing countries  including members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec  exert considerable influence over the supply and price of crude oil and refined petroleum products 
their ability or inability to agree on a common policy on rates of production and other matters has a significant impact on the oil markets 
the commodities trading markets may also influence the selling prices of crude oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to mitigate commodity price volatility  we may not realize the benefit of price increases above the hedged price 
changes in commodity prices can also have a material impact on collateral and margin requirements under our derivative contracts 
in addition  we utilize significant bank credit facilities to support these collateral and margin requirements 
an inability to renew or replace such credit facilities as they mature would negatively impact our liquidity 
technical risk we own or have access to a finite amount of oil and gas reserves which will be depleted over time 
replacement of oil and gas reserves is subject to successful exploration drilling  development activities  and enhanced recovery programs 
therefore  future oil and gas production is dependent on technical success in finding and developing additional hydrocarbon reserves 
exploration activity involves the interpretation of seismic and other geological and geophysical data  which does not always successfully predict the presence of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons 
drilling risks include unexpected adverse conditions  irregularities in pressure or formations  equipment failure  blowouts and weather interruptions 
future developments may be affected by unforeseen reservoir conditions which negatively affect recovery factors or flow rates 
the costs of drilling and development activities have increased in recent years which could negatively affect expected economic returns 
reserve replacement can also be achieved through acquisition 
although due diligence is used in evaluating acquired oil and gas properties  similar risks may be encountered in the production of oil and gas on properties acquired from others 

table of contents oil and gas reserves and discounted future net cash flow risks numerous uncertainties exist in estimating quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues from those reserves 
actual future production  oil and gas prices  revenues  taxes  capital expenditures  operating expenses  and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates and could materially affect the estimated quantities and future net revenues of our proved reserves 
in addition  reserve estimates may be subject to downward or upward revisions based on production performance  purchases or sales of properties  results of future development  prevailing oil and gas prices  production sharing contracts  which may decrease reserves as crude oil and natural gas prices increase  and other factors 
political risk federal  state  local  territorial and foreign laws and regulations relating to tax increases and retroactive tax claims  expropriation or nationalization of property  mandatory government participation  cancellation or amendment of contract rights  and changes in import regulations  limitations on access to exploration and development opportunities  as well as other political developments may affect our operations 
some of the international areas in which we operate and the partners with whom we operate  are politically less stable than other areas and partners 
the threat of terrorism around the world also poses additional risks to the operations of the oil and gas industry 
we market motor fuels through lessee dealers and wholesalers in certain states where legislation prohibits producers or refiners of crude oil from directly engaging in retail marketing of motor fuels 
similar legislation has been periodically proposed in various other states 
environmental risk our oil and gas operations  like those of the industry  are subject to environmental risk such as oil spills  produced water spills  gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of substances or gases that could expose us to substantial liability for pollution or other environmental damage 
our operations are also subject to numerous united states federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
non compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to administrative  civil or criminal penalties  remedial clean ups and natural resource damages or other liabilities 
in addition  increasingly stringent environmental regulations  particularly relating to the production of motor and other fuels have resulted and will likely continue to result in higher capital expenditures and operating expenses for us and the oil and gas industry in general 
climate change risk we recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern 
continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national  regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
these agreements and measures may require significant equipment modifications  operational changes  taxes  or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations  as a result of which we may incur substantial capital expenditures and compliance  operating  maintenance and remediation costs 
in addition  we manufacture petroleum fuels  which through normal customer use result in the emission of greenhouse gases 
regulatory initiatives to reduce the use of these fuels may reduce our sales of  and revenues from  these products 
finally  to the extent that climate change may result in more extreme weather related events  we could experience increased costs related to prevention  maintenance and remediation of affected operations in addition to costs and lost revenues related to delays and shutdowns 
competitive risk the petroleum industry is highly competitive and very capital intensive 
we encounter competition from numerous companies in each of our activities  including acquiring rights to explore for crude oil and natural gas  and in purchasing and marketing of refined products  natural gas and electricity 
many competitors  including national oil companies  are larger and have substantially greater resources 
we are also in competition with producers and marketers of other forms of energy 
increased competition for worldwide oil and gas assets has significantly increased the cost of acquisitions 
in addition  competition for drilling services  technical expertise and equipment has  in the recent past  affected the availability of technical personnel and drilling rigs and has therefore increased capital and operating costs 
catastrophic risk although we maintain a level of insurance coverage consistent with industry practices against property and casualty losses  our oil and gas operations are subject to unforeseen occurrences which may damage or destroy assets or interrupt operations 
examples of catastrophic risks include hurricanes  fires  explosions and blowouts 
these occurrences have affected us from time to time 

table of contents item legal proceedings the corporation  along with many other companies engaged in refining and marketing of gasoline  has been a party to lawsuits and claims related to the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe in gasoline 
a series of similar lawsuits  many involving water utilities or governmental entities  were filed in jurisdictions across the united states against producers of mtbe and petroleum refiners who produced gasoline containing mtbe  including the corporation 
the principal allegation in all cases is that gasoline containing mtbe is a defective product and that these parties are strictly liable in proportion to their share of the gasoline market for damage to groundwater resources and are required to take remedial action to ameliorate the alleged effects on the environment of releases of mtbe 
in  the majority of the cases against the corporation were settled 
in february  the corporation reached an agreement in principle to settle all but three of the remaining cases 
the three unresolved cases consist of two cases that have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in the southern district of new york as part of a multi district litigation proceeding and an action brought in state court by the state of new hampshire 
in  a pre tax charge of million was recorded to cover all of the known mtbe cases against the corporation 
over the last several years  many refiners have entered into consent agreements to resolve the united states environmental protection agency s epa assertions that refining facilities were modified or expanded without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in certain circumstances and other regulations that impose emissions control requirements 
these consent agreements  which arise out of an epa enforcement initiative focusing on petroleum refiners and utilities  have typically imposed substantial civil fines and penalties and required i significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment over a three to eight year time period and ii changes to operations which resulted in increased operating costs 
the capital expenditures  penalties and supplemental environmental projects for individual refineries covered by the settlements can vary significantly  depending on the size and configuration of the refinery  the circumstances of the alleged modifications and whether the refinery has previously installed more advanced pollution controls 
the epa initially contacted the corporation and hovensa regarding the petroleum refinery initiative in august negotiations with the epa and the relevant states and the virgin islands are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the corporation and hovensa 
while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court  additional significant future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred by hovensa over a number of years 
the amount of penalties  if any  is not expected to be material 
on september   hovensa received a notice of violation nov pursuant to section a i of the clean air act act from the epa finding that hovensa failed to obtain proper permitting for the construction and operation of its delayed coking unit in accordance with applicable law and regulations 
hovensa believes it properly obtained all necessary permits for this project 
the nov states that the epa has authority to issue an administrative order assessing penalties for violation of the act 
hovensa has entered into discussions with the epa to reach resolution of this matter 
the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in material liability to hovensa or the corporation 
in december  hovensa received a nov from the epa alleging non compliance with emissions limits in a permit issued by the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources dpnr for the two process heaters in the delayed coking unit 
the nov was issued in response to a voluntary investigation and submission by hovensa regarding potential non compliance with the permit emissions limits for two pollutants 
any exceedances were minor from the perspective of the amount of pollutants emitted in excess of the limits 
hovensa has entered into discussions with the appropriate governmental agencies to reach resolution of this matter and does not believe that it will result in material liability to hovensa or the corporation 
the corporation received a directive from the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep to remediate contamination in the sediments of the lower passaic river and njdep is also seeking natural resource damages 
the directive  insofar as it affects the corporation  relates to alleged releases from a petroleum bulk storage terminal in newark  new jersey now owned by the corporation 
the corporation and over companies entered into an administrative order on consent with the epa to study the same contamination 
njdep has also sued several other companies linked to a facility considered by the state to be the largest contributor to river 
table of contents contamination 
in january  these companies added third party defendants  including the corporation  to that case 
in june  the epa issued a draft study which evaluated six alternatives for early action  with costs ranging from million to billion 
based on adverse comments from the corporation and others  the epa is reevaluating its alternatives 
in addition  the federal trustees for natural resources have begun a separate assessment of damages to natural resources in the passaic river 
given the ongoing studies  remedial costs cannot be reliably estimated at this time 
based on currently known facts and circumstances  the corporation does not believe that this matter will result in material liability because its terminal could not have contributed contamination along most of the river s length and did not store or use contaminants which are of the greatest concern in the river sediments  and because there are numerous other parties who will likely share in the cost of remediation and damages 
in july  hess oil virgin islands corp 
hovic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the corporation  and hovensa  each received a letter from the commissioner of the virgin islands department of planning and natural resources and natural resources trustees  advising of the trustee s intention to bring suit against hovic and hovensa under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla 
the letter alleges that hovic and hovensa are potentially responsible for damages to natural resources arising from releases of hazardous substances from the hovensa oil refinery 
hovensa currently owns and operates a petroleum refinery on the south shore of st 
croix  united states virgin islands  which had been operated by hovic until october an action was filed on may  in the district court of the virgin islands against hovensa  hovic and other companies that operated industrial facilities on the south shore of st 
croix asserting that the defendants are liable under cercla and territorial statutory and common law for damages to natural resources 
hovic and hovensa do not believe that this matter will result in a material liability as they believe that they have strong defenses to this complaint  and they intend to vigorously defend this matter 
the securities and exchange commission sec notified the corporation that on july  it commenced a private investigation into payments made to the government of equatorial guinea or to officials and persons affiliated with officials of the government of equatorial guinea 
in  the sec advised that it had completed its investigation and did not intend to recommend enforcement action against the corporation 
the corporation periodically receives notices from epa that it is a potential responsible party under the superfund legislation with respect to various waste disposal sites 
under this legislation  all potentially responsible parties are jointly and severally liable 
for certain sites  epa s claims or assertions of liability against the corporation relating to these sites have not been fully developed 
with respect to the remaining sites  epa s claims have been settled  or a proposed settlement is under consideration  in all cases for amounts that are not material 
the ultimate impact of these proceedings  and of any related proceedings by private parties  on the business or accounts of the corporation cannot be predicted at this time due to the large number of other potentially responsible parties and the speculative nature of clean up cost estimates  but is not expected to be material 
the corporation is from time to time involved in other judicial and administrative proceedings  including proceedings relating to other environmental matters 
although the ultimate outcome of these proceedings cannot be ascertained at this time and some of them may be resolved adversely to the corporation  no such proceeding is required to be disclosed under applicable rules of the sec 
in management s opinion  based upon currently known facts and circumstances  such proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the corporation

the items in the table below are explained on pages through millions of dollars exploration and production marketing and refining corporate in the discussion that follows  the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after tax basis 
management reviews segment earnings on an after tax basis and uses after tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings 
management believes that after tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings  since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre tax amount 
after tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre tax amounts

risk factors related to our business and operations 
accounting policies critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities on the corporation s balance sheet and revenues and expenses on the income statement 
the accounting methods used can affect net income  equity and various financial statement ratios 
however  the corporation s accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity 
accounting for exploration and development costs exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage  including lease bonuses  brokers fees and other related costs  are capitalized 
annual lease rentals  exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
costs of drilling and equipping productive wells  including development dry holes  and related production facilities are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
if either of those criteria is not met  or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project  the capitalized well costs are charged to expense 
indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves and the economic and operating viability of a project include commitment of project personnel  active negotiations for sales contracts with customers  negotiations with governments  operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors 
crude oil and natural gas reserves the sec revised its oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements effective for year end reporting 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised its accounting standard on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures 
the determination of estimated 
table of contents proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of exploration and production activities 
the estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations  the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment  as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets and goodwill 
for reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations 
in addition  government and project operator approvals must be obtained and  depending on the amount of the project cost  senior management or the board of directors must commit to fund the project 
the corporation maintains its own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties 
the corporation s technical staff updates reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells  performance reviews  new technical data and other studies 
to provide consistency throughout the corporation  standard reserve estimation guidelines  definitions  reporting reviews and approval practices are used 
the internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review 
the corporation also engaged an independent third party consulting firm to audit approximately of the corporation s total proved reserves 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as explained below there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing 
the corporation reviews long lived assets  including oil and gas fields  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
long lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amounts of the long lived assets are not expected to be recovered by undiscounted future net cash flow estimates  the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded 
the amount of impairment is based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows 
in the case of oil and gas fields  the present value of future net cash flows is based on management s best estimate of future prices  which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices  applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk adjusted rate 
the projected production volumes represent reserves  including probable reserves  expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures 
the production volumes  prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information 
oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairments will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve month average prices 
the corporation s impairment tests of long lived e p producing assets are based on its best estimates of future production volumes including recovery factors  selling prices  operating and capital costs  the timing of future production and other factors  which are updated each time an impairment test is performed 
the corporation could have impairments if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease  crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly 
the corporation s goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level  which is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
the impairment test is conducted annually in the fourth quarter or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the reporting unit or units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are determined primarily from the manner in which the business is managed 
the corporation s goodwill is assigned to the e p operating segment and it expects that the benefits of goodwill will be recovered through the operation of that segment 
the corporation s fair value estimate of the e p segment is the sum of the discounted anticipated cash flows of producing assets and known developments  the estimated risk adjusted present value of exploration assets  and an estimated market premium to reflect the market price an acquirer would pay for potential synergies including cost savings  access to new business opportunities  enterprise control  improved processes and increased market share 
the corporation also considers the relative market valuation of similar exploration and production companies 

table of contents the determination of the fair value of the e p segment depends on estimates about oil and gas reserves  future prices  timing of future net cash flows and market premiums 
significant extended declines in crude oil and natural gas prices or reduced reserve estimates could lead to a decrease in the fair value of the e p segment that could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as there are significant differences in the way long lived assets and goodwill are evaluated and measured for impairment testing  there may be impairments of individual assets that would not cause an impairment of the goodwill assigned to the e p segment 
income taxes judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
these judgments include the requirement to only recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when management believes that it is more likely than not  that based on the technical merits  the position will be sustained upon examination 
the corporation has net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in several jurisdictions  including the united states  and has recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits 
additionally  the corporation has deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities 
regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized 
if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 
in evaluating realizability of deferred tax assets  the corporation refers to the reversal periods for temporary differences  available carryforward periods for net operating losses and credit carryforwards  estimates of future taxable income  the availability of tax planning strategies  the existence of appreciated assets and other factors 
estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves and selling prices that are consistent with the corporation s internal business forecasts 
additionally  the corporation has income taxes which have been deferred on intercompany transactions eliminated in consolidation related to transfers of property  plant and equipment remaining within the consolidated group 
the amortization of these income taxes deferred on intercompany transactions will occur ratably with the recovery through depletion and depreciation of the carrying value of these assets 
the corporation does not provide for deferred us income taxes for that portion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
fair value measurements the corporation s derivative instruments and supplemental pension plan investments are recorded at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income each period 
the corporation uses various valuation approaches in determining fair value  including the market and income approaches 
the corporation s fair value measurements also include non performance risk and time value of money considerations 
counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances  and the corporation s credit is considered for accrued liabilities 
the corporation determines fair value in accordance with the fasb fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy that categorizes the sources of inputs  which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market level to estimates determined using related market data level 
multiple inputs may be used to measure fair value  however  the level of fair value is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy 
inputs include discounted cash flow calculations and other unobservable data 
the corporation also records certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value 
these fair value measurements include assets and liabilities recorded in connection with business combinations  the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and long lived assets and goodwill measured at fair value in an impairment assessment 
details on the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair values are as follows fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements that are most observable are based on quoted prices of identical instruments obtained from the principal markets in which they are traded 
closing prices are both readily available and representative of fair value 
market transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to assure liquidity 
the fair value of certain of the corporation s exchange traded futures and options are considered level 
table of contents fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered level measurements based on level inputs include over the counter derivative instruments that are priced on an exchange traded curve but have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange traded contracts 
the corporation utilizes fair value measurements based on level inputs for certain forwards  swaps and options 
the liability related to the corporation s crude oil hedges is classified as level fair value measurements based on level inputs measurements that are least observable are estimated from related market data determined from sources with little or no market activity for comparable contracts or are positions with longer durations 
for example  in its energy marketing business  the corporation sells natural gas and electricity to customers and offsets the price exposure by purchasing forward contracts 
the fair value of these sales and purchases may be based on specific prices at less liquid delivered locations  which are classified as level fair values determined using discounted cash flows are also classified as level derivatives the corporation utilizes derivative instruments for both risk management and trading activities 
in risk management activities  the corporation uses futures  forwards  options and swaps  individually or in combination to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil  natural gas  refined products and electricity  as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
in trading activities  the corporation  principally through a consolidated partnership  trades energy commodities and derivatives  including futures  forwards  options and swaps  based on expectations of future market conditions 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the corporation s balance sheet 
the corporation s policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative 
the changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions cash flow hedges or hedges of firm commitments fair value hedges 
the effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is recorded currently in earnings 
changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings 
the change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings 
derivatives that are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges are tested for effectiveness prospectively before they are executed and both prospectively and retrospectively on an on going basis to determine whether they continue to qualify for hedge accounting 
the prospective and retrospective effectiveness calculations are performed using either historical simulation or other statistical models  which utilize historical observable market data consisting of futures curves and spot prices 
retirement plans the corporation has funded non contributory defined benefit pension plans and an unfunded supplemental pension plan 
the corporation recognizes on the balance sheet the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans 
the determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which relate to the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  and rate of future increases in compensation levels 
these assumptions represent estimates made by the corporation  some of which can be affected by external factors 
for example  the discount rate used to estimate the corporation s projected benefit obligation is based on a portfolio of high quality  fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations  while the expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category  weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on the amounts reported in the corporation s financial statements 
asset retirement obligations the corporation has material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain exploration and production locations 
in accordance with 
table of contents generally accepted accounting principles  the corporation recognizes a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations 
in addition  the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligations is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the corporation capitalizes such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred 
in order to measure these obligations  the corporation estimates the fair value of the obligations by discounting the future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations 
in determining these estimates  the corporation is required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement  timing of settlement  interpretation of legal requirements  inflationary factors and discount rate 
in addition  there are other external factors which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements  fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates  and advances in technology 
as a result  the corporation s estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above 
changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values 
changes in accounting policies the fasb accounting standards codification asc became effective on july  the asc combined multiple sources of authoritative accounting literature into a single source of authoritative gaap organized by accounting topic 
since the asc was not intended to change existing gaap  the only impact on the corporation s financial statements was that specific references to accounting principles have been changed to refer to the asc 
effective january   the corporation adopted the fasb accounting standard for the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling interests in a consolidated subsidiary asc consolidation  originally issued as fas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 

as required  the corporation retrospectively applied the presentation and disclosure requirements of this standard 
at december  and december  noncontrolling interests of million and million  respectively  have been classified as a component of equity 
prior to adoption  noncontrolling interests were classified in other liabilities 
net income loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests must also be separately reported in the statement of consolidated income 
certain other amounts in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes have been reclassified to conform with the presentation requirements of this standard 
effective january   the corporation adopted the fasb accounting standard that expanded the qualitative  quantitative and credit risk disclosure requirements related to an entity s use of derivative instruments asc derivatives and hedging  originally issued as fas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see note  risk management and trading activities  for these disclosures 
effective january   the corporation also adopted the fasb staff position that requires the application of the fair value measurement and disclosure provisions to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis asc fair value measurements and disclosures  originally issued as fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 

such fair value measurements are determined based on the same fair value hierarchy of inputs required to measure the fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
the impact of this accounting standard was not material to the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
effective june   the corporation adopted the fasb accounting standard which provides guidance on the accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued asc subsequent events  originally issued as fas  subsequent events 
the adoption of this standard did not impact the corporation s existing practice of evaluating subsequent events through the date the financial statements are issued 
in january  the fasb adopted an accounting standards update asu extractive activities oil and gas asc oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures which is effective for financial statements for the year ended december  and amends the requirements for oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures 
the objective of the asu was to align accounting standards with the previously issued sec requirements on oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure 
the main provisions of the asu are to expand the definition of oil and gas producing activities to include the extraction of resources which are saleable as synthetic oil or gas  to change the price assumption used for reserve estimation and future cash flows to a twelve month average from the year end 
table of contents price and to amend the geographic disclosure requirements for reporting reserves and other supplementary oil and gas data 
see the supplementary oil and gas data for these disclosures 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb amended existing accounting standards to eliminate the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity asc transfers and servicing  originally issued as fas  accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which did not require consolidation under existing gaap 
the fasb also amended existing accounting standards to limit the circumstances in which transferred financial assets should be derecognized asc consolidation  originally issued as fas  amendments to fasb interpretation no 
fin r 
the amended standards require additional analysis of variable interest entities to determine if consolidation is necessary 
the adoption of these standards will not have a material impact on the corporation s financial statements 
as required  the corporation will adopt the provisions of these standards effective january  environment  health and safety the corporation has a values based  socially responsible strategy focused on improving environment  health and safety performance and making a positive impact on communities where it does business 
the strategy is reflected in the corporation s environment  health  safety and social responsibility ehs sr policies and by environment and safety management systems that help protect the corporation s workforce  customers and local communities 
the corporation s management systems are designed to uphold or exceed international standards and are intended to promote internal consistency  adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in ehs sr performance 
improved performance may  in the short term  increase the corporation s operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to assets  reputation and license to operate 
in addition to enhanced ehs sr performance  improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized as collateral benefits from investments in ehs sr 
the corporation has programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance  audit facilities  train employees  prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate ehs sr goals 
the corporation and hovensa produce and the corporation distributes fuel oils in the united states 
proposals by state regulatory agencies and legislatures have been made that would require a lower sulfur content of fuel oils 
if adopted  these proposals could require capital expenditures by the corporation and hovensa to meet the required sulfur content standards 
as described in item  legal proceedings  in the corporation and hovensa began discussions with the us epa regarding the epa s petroleum refining initiative pri 
the pri is an ongoing program that is designed to reduce certain air emissions at all us refineries 
since  the epa has entered into settlements addressing these emissions with petroleum refining companies that control over of the domestic refining capacity 
negotiations with the epa are continuing and substantial progress has been made toward resolving this matter for both the corporation and hovensa 
while the effect on the corporation of the petroleum refining initiative cannot be estimated until a final settlement is reached and entered by a court  additional significant future capital expenditures and operating expenses will likely be incurred by hovensa over a number of years 
the amount of penalties  if any  is not expected to be material 
the corporation has undertaken a program to assess  monitor and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane 
the corporation recognizes that climate change is a global environmental concern 
the corporation is committed to the responsible management of greenhouse gas emissions from our existing assets and future developments and is implementing a strategy to control our carbon emissions 
the corporation will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation 
sites where corrective action may be necessary include gasoline stations  terminals  onshore exploration and production facilities  refineries including solid waste management units under permits issued pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act and  although not currently significant  superfund sites where the corporation has been named a potentially responsible party 

table of contents the corporation accrues for environmental assessment and remediation expenditures for known sites when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
at year end  the corporation s reserve for estimated environmental liabilities was approximately million 
the corporation s environmental assessment and remediation expenditures were approximately million in each of the years  and the corporation expects that existing reserves for environmental liabilities are sufficient for costs to assess and remediate known sites 
the corporation anticipates capital expenditures for facilities  primarily to comply with federal  state and local environmental standards  of approximately million in forward looking information certain sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  including references to the corporation s future results of operations and financial position  liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures  oil and gas production  tax rates  debt repayment  hedging  derivative  market risk and environmental disclosures  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations and contingencies include forward looking information 
forward looking disclosures are based on the corporation s current understanding and assessment of these activities and reasonable assumptions about the future 
actual results may differ from these disclosures because of changes in market conditions  government actions and other factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of its business  the corporation is exposed to commodity risks related to changes in the price of crude oil  natural gas  refined products and electricity  as well as to changes in interest rates and foreign currency values 
the corporation also has trading operations  principally through a voting interest in a consolidated partnership that trades energy commodities and energy derivatives 
these activities are also exposed to commodity risks primarily related to the prices of crude oil  natural gas and refined products 
the following describes how these risks are controlled and managed 
controls the corporation maintains a control environment under the direction of its chief risk officer and through its corporate risk policy  which the corporation s senior management has approved 
controls include volumetric  term and value at risk limits 
the chief risk officer must approve the use of new instruments or commodities 
risk limits are monitored and reported on daily to business units and to senior management 
the corporation s risk management department also performs independent verifications of sources of fair values and validations of valuation models 
these controls apply to all of the corporation s risk management and trading activities  including the consolidated trading partnership 
the corporation s treasury department is responsible for administering foreign exchange rate and interest rate hedging programs
