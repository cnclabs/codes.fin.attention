item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with par s consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview the introduction of new manufactured and distributed products at selling prices that generate adequate gross margins is critical to our ability to generate economic value and ultimately the creation of adequate returns for our stockholders 
in late and early  we resized our generic products division as part of an ongoing strategic assessment of our businesses 
this initiative was intended to enable us to optimize our current generic product portfolio and our pipeline of first to file and first to market generic products 
as a result  we believe we are better positioned to compete in the generic marketplace over the long term 
our internal research and development now targets high value  first to file paragraph ivs or first to market product opportunities 
externally  we intend to concentrate on acquiring assets and or partner with technology based companies that can deliver similar product opportunities 
as of december  we had confirmed first to files and two potential first to market product opportunities 
generally  products that we have developed internally contribute higher gross margin percentages than products that we sell under supply and distribution agreements because under such agreements we pay a percentage of the gross or net profits or a percentage of sales to our strategic partners 
to continue the development of our proprietary products division  strativa pharmaceuticals  we acquired the worldwide rights to nascobal nasal spray on march  nascobal nasal spray is an fda approved prescription vitamin b treatment indicated for maintenance of remission in certain pernicious anemia patients  as well as a supplement for a variety of b deficiencies 
it is the first and currently only once weekly  self administered alternative to b injections 
strativa also expects to launch two products in zuplenz tm  which is an oral soluble film formulation of ondansetron to be used for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with radiotherapy  and post operative nausea and vomiting  and oravig tm  which is an antifungal therapy to be used for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis  an opportunistic infection commonly found in immunocompromised patients  including those with hiv and cancer 
in february  we announced that due to a fda restriction on foreign travel to india  the fda has been unable to perform a recent inspection of the clinical and analytical sites for the bioequivalence study related to zuplenz tm 
the nda cannot be approved until the fda receives a satisfactory inspection report of the clinical and analytical sites for the bioequivalence study related to zuplenz tm 
the fda restriction on foreign travel in india has been subsequently lifted and the inspection of the clinical and analytical sites for the bioequivalence study related to zuplenz tm is in the process of being scheduled 
no issues related to the study data or film product were identified 
sales and gross margins of our products depend principally on i the introduction of other generic and brand products in direct competition with our significant products  ii the ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after our relevant patent or exclusivity periods expire  or during our exclusivity periods with authorized generic products  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits we generate from any one product  iii the pricing practices of competitors and the removal of competing products from the market  iv the continuation of our existing license  supply and distribution agreements and our ability to enter into new agreements  v the consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  vi the willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among drugs of different generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  vii our ability to procure approval of andas and ndas and the timing and success of our future new product launches  viii our ability to obtain marketing exclusivity periods for our generic products  ix our ability to maintain patent protection of our brand products  x the extent of market penetration for our existing product line  xi customer satisfaction with the level  quality and amount of our customer service  and xii the market acceptance of our recently introduced branded product nascobal and the successful development and commercialization of our in licensed proprietary product pipeline 
net sales and gross margins derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that we believe to be unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
as the patent s for a brand name product and the related exclusivity period s expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval from the fda for a generic equivalent of the product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market 
at that time  however  the branded company may license an authorized generic product to a competing generic company 
as additional generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals for competing products  the market share and the price of those products have typically declined  often significantly  depending on several factors  including the number of competitors  the price of the brand product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors 
net sales and gross margins derived from brand pharmaceutical products typically follow a different pattern 
sellers of brand pharmaceutical products benefit from years of being the exclusive supplier to the market due to patent protections for the brand products 
the benefits include significantly higher gross margins relative to sellers of generic pharmaceutical products 
however  commercializing brand pharmaceutical products is more costly than generic pharmaceutical products 
sellers of brand pharmaceutical products often have increased infrastructure costs relative to sellers of generic pharmaceutical products and make significant investments in the development and or licensing of these products without a guarantee that these expenditures will result in the successful development or launch of brand products that will prove to be commercially successful 
selling brand products also tends to require greater sales and marketing expenses to create a market for the products than is necessary with respect to the sale of generic products 
just as we compete against companies selling branded products when we sell generic products  we confront the same competitive pressures when we sell our proprietary products 
specifically  after patent protections expire  generic products can be sold in the market at a significantly lower price than the branded version  and  where available  may be required or encouraged in preference to the branded version under third party reimbursement programs  or substituted by pharmacies for branded versions by law 
par pharmaceutical generic products division our strategy for our generic division is to continue to differentiate ourselves by carefully choosing opportunities with minimal competition eg  first to file and first to market products 
by leveraging our expertise in research and development  manufacturing and distribution  we are able to effectively and efficiently pursue these opportunities and support our partners 
during the year ended december   our generic business net revenues and gross margin were concentrated in a few products 
the top five generic products metoprolol succinate er metoprolol  sumatriptan  meclizine  the clonidine transdermal system clonidine tds  and dronabinol accounted for approximately of total consolidated revenues and approximately of total consolidated gross margins in the year ended december  we began selling metoprolol in the fourth quarter of as the authorized generic distributor pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with astrazeneca 
there had been two competitors marketing generic metoprolol until the fourth quarter of  when those two companies stopped selling metoprolol due to violations of the fda s current good manufacturing practices 
throughout the first two quarters of  we did not have competition for sales of the four skus packaging sizes of metoprolol that we sell  which resulted in increased volume of units sold coupled with a price increase commensurate with being the sole generic distributor 
watson pharmaceuticals announced on august   however  that the fda had approved two of its abbreviated new drug applications anda for metoprolol  and accordingly  we are no longer the sole distributor for those two skus mg and mg 
our sales volume and unit price for metoprolol were adversely impacted for these two skus during the second half of and we anticipate that our sales and related gross margins from the other two skus mg and mg will be negatively impacted if and when watson receives fda approval for those two skus 
additional competition from competitors on any or all of the four skus in will result in significant additional declines in sales volume and unit price which may negatively impact our revenues and gross margins including possible provisions for inventory to cost of goods sold as compared to as the authorized generic distributor for metoprolol we do not control the manufacturing of the product  and any disruption in supply at our partner could have a negative effect on our revenues and gross margins 
in november  we launched tramadol er  the generic version of ultram er  after a favorable court ruling 
tramadol er is used to relieve pain  including pain after surgery and for chronic ongoing pain 
we are one of two competitors in this market  with the other competitor being the authorized generic 
we manufacture and distribute this product 
in august  we launched clonidine tds  the generic version of boehringer ingelheim s catapres tts 
the product is manufactured by aveva 
par and aveva share profits from the sales of the product 
from launch to december   we were the sole generic distributor of this product  and as of the date of this form k  we believe we remain the sole generic distributor of this product 
as the distributor of clonidine tds we do not control the manufacturing of the product  and any disruption in supply at our partner could have a negative effect on our revenues and gross margins 
our fourth quarter sales of clonidine tds were adversely affected because we unexpectedly held an exclusive position with clonidine tds at the third quarter launch date and  therefore  did not have the launch quantities to meet the unanticipated demand as the sole generic distributor 
this product has a long manufacturing lead time and our partner  aveva  is working diligently to increase production in proportion to the demand for clonidine tds 
in the fourth quarter of  we launched generic versions of imitrex sumatriptan injection mg and mg starter kits and mg and mg prefilled syringe cartridges pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline plc 
from the beginning of to december   we remained the sole generic distributor of skus with one competitor for a single sku 
the remaining net book value of the associated intangible asset was million at december  and will be amortized over approximately two years 
in the third quarter of  we launched dronabinol in mg  mg and mg strengths in soft gel capsules 
we believe we are one of two generic distributors of dronabinol 
we share net product margin  as contractually defined  on sales of dronabinol with svc pharma lp  an affiliate of rhodes technologies 
the remaining net book value of the associated intangible asset was million at december  and will be amortized over approximately four years 
we marketed meclizine prior to an explosion at the manufacturing facility of our active pharmaceutical ingredient api supplier in february subsequently  we qualified a new api source and received the appropriate approval of our anda to manufacture and market meclizine utilizing our new supplier 
we reintroduced meclizine hcl tablets in mg and mg strengths in the third quarter of for  we believe we were the exclusive supplier of this generic product 
in addition  our investments in generic product development are expected to yield approximately to new anda filings during each of  and these anda filings are expected to lead to product launches based on one or more of the following expiry of the relevant month stay period  patent expiry date  and expiry of regulatory exclusivity 
however  such potential product launches may not occur or be delayed due to various circumstances  including extended litigation  outstanding citizens petitions  other regulatory requirements set forth by the fda  and stays of litigation 
these anda filings would be significant mileposts for us as we expect many of these potential products to be first to file first to market opportunities with gross margins in excess of our current portfolio 
we or our strategic partners currently have approximately andas pending with the fda  which includes first to file and or first to market opportunities 
no assurances can be given that we or any of our strategic partners will successfully complete the development of any of these potential products either under development or proposed for development  that regulatory approvals will be granted for any such product  that any approved product will be produced in commercial quantities or that any approved product will be sold profitably 
strativa pharmaceuticals proprietary products division for strativa  we will continue to invest in the marketing and sales of our current products and prepare for the anticipated commercialization of our in licensed products 
in addition  we will continue to seek new licenses and acquisitions to accelerate the growth of our branded business 
in july  we received fda approval for our first new drug application nda  filed pursuant to section b of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  and immediately began marketing megestrol acetate oral suspension nanocrystal dispersion megace es 
megace es is indicated for the treatment of anorexia  cachexia or any unexplained significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of aids and utilizes the megace brand name that the company has licensed from bristol myers squibb company 
the remaining net book value of the trademark was million at december  and will be amortized over approximately years 
we promoted megace es as our primary brand product from through march with the acquisition of nascobal nasal spray  strativa will focus on marketing both megace es and nascobal 
in september  we entered into an extended reach agreement with solvay pharmaceuticals  inc that provides for our branded sales force to co promote androgel for a period of six years 
as compensation for our marketing and sales efforts  we will receive up to million annually  paid quarterly  for the six year period 
a lawsuit was filed in by the federal trade commission alleging violations of antitrust laws stemming from our court approved settlement of patent litigation with solvay 
on february   the court granted our motion to dismiss the ftc s claims 
for more information regarding the lawsuit  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with bioalliance pharma to acquire the us commercialization rights to bioalliance s miconazole  mucoadhesive buccal tablets  which is marketed in europe under the brand name loramyc  an antifungal therapy in development for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis  an opportunistic infection commonly found in immunocompromised patients  including those with hiv and cancer 
strativa will market this product under the trade name of oravig tm in the us if approved 
phase iii studies were completed by bioalliance  and bioalliance submitted a nda for oravig tm in february and the nda is under review with a scheduled action date in the second quarter of if the product receives fda approval  we will pay bioalliance million and commercialize the product  which will be supplied by bioalliance 
in addition to paying bioalliance royalties on net sales  bioalliance may receive milestone payments if commercial sales achieve specified sales targets 
in august  we acquired the north american commercial rights to zensana tm ondansetron hcl oral spray from hana biosciences  inc ondansetron is indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy  radiotherapy  and the post operative period 
we were collaborating with novadel pharma  inc in the reformulation of zensana tm 
in  bioequivalence to the reference drug was achieved in certain studies and not achieved in others 
we are evaluating options in order to determine the next steps for the zensana tm program 
in june  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with monosol rx to acquire the us commercialization rights to monosol s oral soluble film formulation of ondansetron zuplenz tm  which is being developed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy  radiotherapy  and the post operative period 
in the first quarter of  phase iii studies were completed by monosol  and an nda was submitted for zuplenz tm and is under review 
in february  we announced that due to a fda restriction on foreign travel to india  the fda has been unable to perform a recent inspection of the clinical and analytical sites for the bioequivalence study related to zuplenz tm 
the nda cannot be approved until the fda receives a satisfactory inspection report of the clinical and analytical sites for the bioequivalence study related to zuplenz tm 
the fda restriction on foreign travel in india has been subsequently lifted and the inspection of the clinical and analytical sites for the bioequivalence study related to zuplenz tm is in the process of being scheduled 
no issues related to the study data or film product were identified 
if zuplenz tm receives fda approval and is launched as expected in  we will pay monosol additional milestone payments totaling million 
monosol would supply zuplenz tm to us 
in addition to royalties on net sales  monosol may receive milestone payments if commercial sales achieve specified sales targets 
in january  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with alfacell corporation to acquire the us commercialization rights to alfacell s onconase ranpirnase  then in development for the treatment of unresectable malignant mesothelioma 
in may  alfacell reported that the preliminary data from its phase iii clinical trial did not meet statistical significance for the primary endpoint of overall survival in unresectable malignant mesothelioma 
on january   alfacell reported that  at a pre nda meeting with the fda  the fda recommended that an additional clinical trial be conducted prior to submitting an nda 
due to these developments  on september   we entered into a termination and mutual release agreement with alfacell  which terminated our commercial rights and obligations under the licensing agreement  in exchange for a royalty on us sales of any ranpirnase product commercialized by or on behalf of alfacell in the field of cancer 
on march   we acquired the worldwide rights to nascobal cyanocobalamin  usp nasal spray from qol medical  llc 
nascobal nasal spray is an fda approved prescription vitamin b treatment indicated for maintenance of remission in certain pernicious anemia patients  as well as a supplement for a variety of b deficiencies 
under the terms of the all cash transaction  we paid qol medical million for the worldwide rights to nascobal nasal spray 
we manufacture nascobal nasal spray with assets acquired on march  from mdrna  inc the remaining net book value of the related intangible asset was million at december  and will be amortized over approximately years from the acquisition date 
other considerations in addition to the substantial costs of product development  we may incur significant legal costs in bringing certain products to market 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is often protracted and expensive 
pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products increasingly are suing companies that produce generic forms of their patented brand products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which could delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market 
generally  a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent s on the brand name drug expires 
when an anda is filed with the fda for approval of a generic drug  the filing person may certify either that the patent listed by the fda as covering the branded product is about to expire  in which case the anda will not become effective until the expiration of such patent  or that the patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  sale or use of the new drug for which the anda is filed 
in either case  there is a risk that a branded pharmaceutical company may sue the filing person for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
because a substantial portion of our current business involves the marketing and development of generic versions of brand products  the threat of litigation  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain  is always present 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming  and could result in a substantial delay in  or prevent  the introduction and or marketing of products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
results of operations results of operations  including segment net revenues  segment gross margin and segment operating income loss information for our par pharmaceutical generic products segment and our strativa proprietary products segment  consisted of the following revenues compared to total revenues of our top selling products were as follows amounts in thousands product change par pharmaceutical generic metoprolol succinate er toprol xl sumatriptan succinate injection imitrex meclizine hydrochloride antivert clonidine tds catapres tts dronabinol marinol cabergoline dostinex propranolol hcl er inderal la cholestyramine powder questran methimazole tapazole megestrol oral suspension megace tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets ultracet fluticasone flonase product change ibuprofen rx advil  nuprin  motrin various amoxicillin products amoxil other product related revenues other total par pharmaceutical generic revenues strativa megace es nascobal nasal spray other product related revenues total strativa revenues for the years ended december  percentage of total revenues in thousands change change revenues par pharmaceutical generic strativa total revenues the increase in generic segment revenues for the year ended december  was primarily due to the continued exclusivity on two skus packaging sizes of mg and mg of metoprolol succinate er and reduced competition for sales of two other skus mg and mg of metoprolol succinate er relative to the prior year 
the dollar amount increase of metoprolol revenues for can be attributed to volume of units sold approximately of total dollar increase with the remainder of the dollar amount increase due to price 
we launched clonidine in august as the sole generic distributor 
previously  we launched various sumatriptan skus in the fourth quarter of throughout  we remained the sole distributor of three sumatriptan skus with one competitor for a single sku 
in the third quarter of  we launched multiple strengths of dronabinol 
we also commenced shipment of meclizine hcl tablets in mg and mg strengths in the third quarter of other notable launches in were tramadol er generic ultram er  which launched in the fourth quarter of  risperidone odt  which launched in the second quarter of  and alprazolam  which launched in the first quarter of these three products are included in other above 
offsetting these increases of net sales were lower generic revenues of certain existing products primarily driven by termination of supply and distribution agreements and or increased competition affecting both price and volume  including fluticasone  various amoxicillin products  cabergoline  ibuprofen  and propranolol hcl er caps 
in addition  we experienced declines in many of our other generic products due to volume and pricing pressures  and or product discontinuation as a result of the fourth quarter restructuring of the generic business to trim our generic product portfolio in an effort to retain only those marketed products that deliver acceptable profit 
net sales of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  were approximately of our total revenues in and approximately of our total revenues in the increase in the percentage is driven by the increased sales of metoprolol  dronabinol and sumatriptan coupled with the launch of clonidine 
we are substantially dependent upon distributed products for our overall sales  and any inability by our suppliers to meet demand could adversely affect our future sales 
the increase in the strativa segment revenues in was primarily due to the acquisition of nascobal nasal spray and the associated relaunch of the product in the second quarter of by strativa 
the net sales decline of megace es in is primarily attributed to the timing of trade buying patterns 
in december  the trade delayed its megace es purchases until after the holidays to the benefit of in december  the trade accelerated its megace es purchases before the holidays to the detriment of megace es also experienced higher returns during as compared to the prior year 
we expect that the megace es product returns rate for will approximate the returns rate 
revenues compared to total revenues of our top selling products were as follows amounts in thousands product change generic metoprolol succinate er toprol xl fluticasone flonase meclizine hydrochloride antivert cabergoline dostinex sumatriptan succinate injection imitrex propranolol hcl er inderal la various amoxicillin products amoxil dronabinol marinol ibuprofen rx advil  nuprin  motrin megestrol oral suspension megace methimazole tapazole fluoxetine prozac lovastatin mevacor tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets ultracet ranitidine hcl syrup zantac other product related revenues other total par pharmaceutical generic revenues strativa megace es nascobal nasal spray other product related revenues total strativa revenues for the years ended december  percentage of total revenues in thousands change change revenues par pharmaceutical generic strativa total revenues decreased generic revenues in were primarily due to pricing pressure on existing products including fluticasone  propranolol hcl er caps  cabergoline  various amoxicillin products  tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets and ranitidine hcl syrup 
this was coupled with discontinuation of polyethylene glycol included in other above  and lower royalty payments driven primarily by ondansetron tablets 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales resulting from meclizine  which launched in july  the launch of the mg  mg  and mg strengths of dronabinol in july  the launch of sumatriptan succinate in november and increased sales of metoprolol 
among the top selling products in that did not have sales in were dronabinol and sumatriptan 
lower generic revenues in were primarily driven by lower sales of certain existing products driven by increased competition affecting both price and volume  including fluticasone  propranolol hcl er caps  tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets  cabergoline  various amoxicillin products  ranitidine hcl syrup  and ibuprofen 
in addition  we experienced declines in many of our other products due to volume and pricing pressures  and polyethylene glycol  which decreased million due to product discontinuation as well as lower royalties  which decreased primarily from lower sales of ondansetron 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of metoprolol succinate er  resulting from increased volume due to full year impact of mg  mg and mg strengths  meclizine  resulting from the relaunch in july and the new product launches described above 
net sales of distributed products  which consist of products manufactured under contract and licensed products  were approximately of our total revenues in and approximately of our total revenues in the increase in the percentage is driven by the launch of dronabinol and sumatriptan and increased sales of metoprolol partially offset by lower sales of fluticasone and higher sales of meclizine  which is a manufactured product 
the strativa revenue growth in is principally driven by price increases  timing of trade buying patterns and fees received related to the co promotion of androgel 
these increases were offset by a more challenging reimbursement environment and included a change in reimbursement status that was implemented by a major medicare part d plan 
gross revenues to total revenues deductions generic drug pricing at the wholesale level can create significant differences between our invoice price and net selling price 
wholesale customers purchase product from us at invoice price  then resell the product to specific healthcare providers on the basis of prices negotiated between us and the providers  and the wholesaler submits a chargeback credit to us for the difference 
we record estimates for these chargebacks as well as sales returns  rebates and incentive programs  and the sales allowances for all our customers at the time of sale as deductions from gross revenues  with corresponding adjustments to our accounts receivable reserves and allowances 
we have the experience and the access to relevant information that we believe necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
some of the assumptions we use for certain of our estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as wholesale customer inventory data and market data  or other market factors beyond our control 
the estimates that are most critical to the establishment of these reserves  and therefore would have the largest impact if these estimates were not accurate  are estimates related to expected contract sales volumes  average contract pricing  customer inventories and return levels 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust our reserves accordingly if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
with the exception of the product returns allowance  the ending balances of account receivable reserves and allowances generally are eliminated during a two month to four month period  on average 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to our customers and when collectability is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time that products are received by the customers 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  we record estimates for chargebacks  rebates and incentives  returns  cash discounts and other sales reserves that reduce accounts receivable 
our gross revenues for the years ended december   december  and december  before deductions for chargebacks  rebates and incentive programs including rebates paid under federal and state government medicaid drug reimbursement programs  sales returns and other sales allowances were as follows for the years ended december  thousands percentage of gross revenues percentage of gross revenues percentage of gross revenues gross revenues chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other medicaid rebates and rebates due under other us government pricing programs total deductions total revenues the total gross to net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales decreased for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december   primarily due to a significant reduction of chargebacks 
this decrease was driven primarily by the increase in metoprolol sales during the metoprolol sales increase was driven by limited competition that resulted in increased volume to retail chains which do not result in a chargeback  as well as a price increase  commensurate with being the sole distributor of the generic product throughout for two skus mg and mg and with reduced competition for two other skus mg and mg  which reduces the chargebacks that we pay to wholesalers 
this was coupled with lower overall volume of sales of products that carry higher than average chargeback rates and the discontinuation of other lower margin products 
the total gross to net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales increased in compared to  primarily due to increased pricing pressure of key products including metoprolol  fluticasone  and cabergoline 
this increase was tempered by the relaunch of meclizine in july  the launches of dronabinol in july and sumatriptan in november  lower royalty income in  lower returns and lower rebates primarily driven by lower fluticasone sales  customer net pricing trends and lower formulary sales 
gross to net deductions are discussed in the critical accounting policies and use of estimates section below 
gross margin compared to for the years ended december  percentage of total revenues in thousands change gross margin par pharmaceutical generic strativa total gross margin our increase in generic gross margin dollars in is primarily due to higher sales of metoprolol coupled with a full year of sumatriptan sales launched in november  the launch of clonidine in august  a full year of dronabinol sales launched in july  a full year of meclizine sales commenced shipment in the third quarter of  and the launch of tramadol er generic ultram er in november these six products along with cabergoline and propranolol totaled approximately million gross margin dollars and totaled a gross margin percentage of approximately for these products excluding clonidine and tramadol er  which both launched in totaled approximately million gross margin dollars and a gross margin percentage of approximately for gross margin related to all other revenue sources eg  products and royalties totaled approximately million and a gross margin percentage of approximately for as compared to gross margin dollars of million with a gross margin percentage of approximately 
gross margin related to all other revenue sources benefited from the generic segment s resizing which began in the fourth quarter of and included the trimming of the generic product portfolio to retain only those marketed products that deliver acceptable gross margins  the non recurrence of an impairment charge for nabumetone in the prior year  the first quarter launch of alprazolam that has a high gross margin percentage and additional tramadol hcl and acetaminophen generic ultracet business due to loss of a competitor that had to exit the market during the second quarter of strativa gross margin dollars decreased for  primarily due to lower sales of megace es

these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of metoprolol succinate  meclizine driven by the relaunch in july  dronabinol launched in july and sumatriptan succinate launched in november as well as lower inventory write offs 
the strativa gross margin increased in from the year ended december  due to revenue growth discussed above 
the rate of gross margin as a percentage of net product sales in reflects increased sales of lower margin metoprolol succinate er  increased amortization driven by the nabumetone impairment charge and lower royalty income and lower sales of higher margin products such as cabergoline and propranolol hcl er  offset by the increased sales of higher margin meclizine and megace es  the launches of higher margin dronabinol and sumatriptan succinate  lower sales of low margin products such as fluticasone and lower inventory write offs

in conjunction with this action  we began to significantly reduce our internal generic products research and development effort in the first quarter of these actions led to reduced full year expenditures of million driven by an million reduction in employment related costs on headcount reductions of approximately employees 
the remainder of the savings was the result of lower biostudy costs  down million  and lower depreciation  supplies  maintenance  and corporate overhead allocations  combined costs of million  as we concentrate our efforts on completing a more focused portfolio of generic products 
these reductions were somewhat tempered by higher outside development costs  up million  driven by increased activity with third party partners related to new product development and licensing opportunities 
strativa pharmaceuticals proprietary products division the decrease in strativa research and development in principally reflects the non recurrence of a million initial cash payment made to alfacell corporation in the first quarter of under an exclusive licensing agreement with alfacell to acquire the us commercialization rights to onconase 
on september   we entered into a termination and mutual release agreement with alfacell  which terminated our commercial rights and obligations under the licensing agreement  in exchange for a royalty on us sales of any onconase product commercialized by or on behalf of alfacell in the field of cancer  the non recurrence of approximately million of costs related to the development of zensana tm  an oral spray formulation of ondansetron  which was acquired in the latter half of  and lower net milestone payments to monosol rx relating to zuplenz tm the oral soluble film formulation of ondansetron as a million milestone payment triggered by monosol rx in january upon successful completion of bioequivalence reports for zuplenz tm was more than offset by the non recurrence of million of development milestones that were paid during the first nine months of on april   strativa submitted an nda for zuplenz tm to the fda seeking approval in mg and mg strengths for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy  radiotherapy  and the post operative period 
to date  strativa has paid monosol rx a total of million for the completion of certain milestones  the next milestone payment is payable upon fda approval of the nda 
these reductions were tempered by an additional million paid and expensed in the fourth quarter of to monosol rx under the terms of an amendment to the original license  development and supply agreement for zuplenz tm and a new development and commercialization agreement for up to three potential oral soluble film products  and higher year over year fda filing fees due to the new drug application for zuplenz tm and our q acquisition of nascobal 
research and development compared to for the years ended december  percentage of total revenues in thousands change change research and development par pharmaceutical generic strativa total research and development our research and development expenses decreased in from the year ended december   driven by a reduction in expenditures related to both the strativa and generic research and development expenditures 
expenditures related to strativa were down approximately million  which was principally driven by a net reduction of million of one time strativa milestone payments  as million of payments to alfacell and monosol rx  detailed below  were more than offset by the non recurrence of million of payments incurred in to acquire rights to late stage compounds  comprised of oravig tm  pafuramidine maleate and zensana tm 
the development of pafuramidine maleate was discontinued in february in january  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with alfacell corporation to acquire the commercialization rights to onconase in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  we made an initial cash payment of million to alfacell in the first quarter of in september  we entered into a termination and mutual release agreement with alfacell  which terminated our commercial rights and obligations under the licensing agreement  in exchange for a royalty on us sales of any ranpirnase product commercialized by or on behalf of alfacell in the field of cancer 
in june  we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement under which we acquired the commercialization rights in the united states to the oral soluble film formulation of ondansetron from monosol rx

restructuring costs compared to and compared to for the years ended december  in thousands restructuring costs in october  we announced our plans to resize our generic products division as part of an ongoing strategic assessment of our businesses 
in conjunction with this plan  we have taken steps to reduce our research and development expenses by decreasing internal generic research and development effort 
under this plan  we are continuing to concentrate our efforts on completing a more focused portfolio of generic products and will continue to look for opportunities with external partners 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we initiated actions to trim our generic product portfolio in an effort to retain only those products that deliver acceptable profit 
these actions resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately positions in manufacturing  research and development  and general and administrative functions 
in connection with these actions  we incurred expenses for severance and other employee related costs 
in addition  as part of our plans to resize our generic products division  we determined to abandon or sell certain assets that resulted in asset impairments  and accelerated depreciation expense 
during the year ended december   we incurred additional restructuring costs as we continued to execute this plan  principally driven by charges for one time termination benefit costs recognized in the first quarter 
these charges were somewhat tempered by a modest revision in estimate of certain termination benefit costs 
the following table summarizes the restructuring costs in and the remaining related restructuring liabilities balance included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  amounts in thousands restructuring activities initial charge liabilities at december  cash payments additional charges reversals  reclass or transfers liabilities at december  severance and employee benefits to be paid in cash severance related to share based compensation asset impairments and other total we previously disclosed that we had expected to record million of accelerated depreciation related to assets that were held and used as of december  and were expected to be idled or sold in late during the first quarter of  and in conjunction with our acquisition of nascobal and certain assets from mdrna refer to notes to consolidated financial statements note acquisitions  we reevaluated our plan for these assets

the gain is mainly attributed to mdrna s plans to exit its contract manufacturing business 
loss gain on extinguishment of senior subordinated convertible notes for the years ended december  in thousands loss gain on extinguishment of senior subordinated convertible notes we account for our senior subordinated convertible notes the notes under the provisions of fasb asc debt with conversion and other options  which requires that we separately account for the liability and equity components of the notes  as they may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion 
the effect of the standard is that the equity component is included in the additional paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible debt instruments 
this discounted carrying value for the debt instrument is subsequently accreted to the face value of the notes over their term through additional noncash interest expense 
as such  the carrying value of debt as recorded on the balance sheet is less than the face value of the debt until the day of maturity 
the following table summarizes the discounted carrying value and face value of our debt in thousands as of december  face value of senior subordinated convertible notes discounted carrying value of senior subordinated convertible notes during the fourth quarter of  we began to repurchase notes in advance of their september  maturity date 
we continued to periodically purchase notes on the open market through the third quarter of  and through a modified dutch auction tender offer announced and completed in the fourth quarter of all repurchases were made at prices at or below par value of the notes 
fasb asc dictates that we allocate purchase price to the estimated fair value to the notes exclusive of the conversion feature and to the conversion feature 
based on our assessment  the entire repurchase price was allocated to the notes exclusive of the conversion feature 
the difference between the repurchase price and the net discounted carrying value of the notes was reflected in the gain or loss on the extinguishment in the statement of operations 
the following table illustrates the difference between the repurchase price  the face value and the discounted carrying value in thousands for the years ended december  aggregate principal amount of notes repurchased face value aggregate repurchase price including fees and commissions acceleration of deferred financing costs gain on extinguishment of notes prior to adoption of fasb asc aggregate net discounted carrying value of debt per asc balance sheet value aggregate repurchase price including fees and commissions acceleration of deferred financing costs loss gain on extinguishment of senior subordinated convertible notes as calculated per fasb asc and during in connection with the repurchase of the notes  we paid approximately million in accrued interest and we paid commissions and fees of approximately million

arie gutman  president and chief executive officer of finetech

gutman also resigned from our board of directors 
the results of finetech operations have been classified as discontinued for all periods presented because we had no continuing involvement in finetech

financial condition liquidity and capital resources year ended december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at end of period discussion of liquidity for the year ended and as of december  cash provided by operations for reflects an increase in cash reflective of net income generated by our operations partially offset by cash paid to pentech in connection with the unfavorable court decision of approximately million and working capital requirements 
cash flows used by investing activities were primarily driven by the acquisitions of nascobal from qol medical  llc and certain assets and liabilities from mdrna  inc for approximately million offset by the liquidation of net investments in available for sale debt securities to fund the acquisitions and the payment of the unfavorable court decision related to pentech 
cash used in financing activities in mainly represented the repurchase of approximately million in the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior subordinated convertible notes due september our working capital  current assets minus current liabilities  of million at december  increased approximately million from million at december   which primarily reflects the increase in accounts receivable and inventories mainly related to metoprolol sales offset by the funds invested in the acquisitions of nascobal from qol medical  llc and certain assets and liabilities from mdrna  inc the working capital ratio  which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities  was x at december  compared to x at december  we believe that our working capital ratio indicates the ability to meet our ongoing and foreseeable obligations for the next fiscal months 
sources of liquidity our primary source of liquidity is cash received from customers 
in  we collected approximately  million with respect to net product sales as compared to approximately million in the increase can be attributed to our improved sales performance in as compared to the prior year comparable periods  which  as discussed above  was driven primarily by metoprolol sales  the revenue from which increased in due to fewer competitive products in the market 
our ability to continue to generate cash from operations is predicated not only on our ability to maintain a sustainable amount of sales of our current product portfolio  but also our ability to monetize our product pipeline and future products that we may acquire 
our generic product pipeline included first to file and two first to market opportunities a total of approximately andas pending with the fda and our strativa pipeline had brand drugs in active development as of december  our future profitability depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to introduce  on a timely basis  new generic products that are either the first to market or among the first to market or otherwise can gain significant market share 
commercializing brand pharmaceutical products is more costly than generic products 
we cannot be certain that our expenditures will result in the successful development or launch of brand products that will prove to be commercially successful or will improve the long term profitability of our business 
we also filed a shelf registration statement during under the shelf registration  we may sell any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  or warrants from time to time for an aggregate offering price of up to million 
we have no current plans to raise capital via the shelf registration statement 
uses of liquidity our uses of liquidity and future and potential uses of liquidity include the following cash paid for the acquisitions of nascobal from qol medical  llc and certain assets and liabilities from mdrna  inc for approximately million during the second quarter of cash paid to pentech in connection with the unfavorable court decision of approximately million in the first quarter of cash paid for inventory purchases was approximately million for as compared to approximately million for the increase is mainly due to our sales performance improvement  which resulted in improved inventory turns 
cash paid to all other suppliers and third parties was approximately million for as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the increase is mainly due to our sales performance improvement of distributed products that resulted in higher amounts paid to partners 
cash compensation paid to employees was approximately million for as compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the decrease for was mainly due to the resizing of our generic products division begun in october  which resulted in a workforce reduction of approximately positions coupled with lower bonus payments in related to operating performance as compared to bonus payments in related to operating performance 
bonus payments in the first quarter of related to operating performance were higher than levels 
the payment of our outstanding senior subordinated convertible notes million principal amount outstanding at december  in september potential liabilities related to the outcomes of audits by regulatory agencies like the irs or the office of inspector general of the department of veterans affairs 
we accrued for a loss contingency estimated at approximately million  including interest  as of december  related to a routine post award contract review of our department of veterans affairs contract for the periods to that is being conducted by the office of inspector general of the department of veterans affairs 
in the event that our loss contingency is ultimately determined to be higher than originally accrued  the recording of the additional liability may result in a material impact on our liquidity or financial condition when such additional liability is paid 
capital expenditures are expected to total approximately million 
expenditures related to current business development and product acquisition activities 
as of december   the total potential future payments that ultimately could be due under existing agreements related to products in various stages of development were approximately million 
this amount is exclusive of contingencies tied to the achievement of sales milestones  which will be funded through future revenue streams 
this amount is also exclusive of product launch costs 
in  strativa expects to launch zuplenz tm and oravig tm  pending fda approval of these products 
normal course payables due to distribution agreement partners of approximately million as of december  related primarily to amounts due under profit sharing agreements 
we expect to pay substantially all of the million during the first two months of the first quarter of the risk of lower cash receipts from customers due to potential decreases in revenues associated with competition or supply issues related to partnered products  in particular metoprolol  would be mitigated by proportional decreases in amounts payable to distribution agreement partners 
we believe that we will be able to monetize our current product portfolio  our product pipeline  and future product acquisitions and generate sufficient operating cash flows that  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  will allow us to meet our financial obligations over the foreseeable future 
we expect to continue to fund our operations  including our research and development activities  capital projects  in licensing product activity and obligations under our existing distribution and development arrangements discussed herein  out of our working capital 
our future product acquisitions may require additional debt and or equity financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such additional financing when needed on acceptable or favorable terms 
analysis of available for sale debt securities held as of december  in addition to our cash and cash equivalents  we had approximately million of available for sale debt securities classified as current assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  these available for sale debt securities were all available for immediate sale 
we intend to continue to use our current liquidity to support the expansion of our strativa business  enter into product license arrangements  potentially acquire other complementary businesses and products  and for general corporate purposes 
contractual obligations as of december  the dollar values of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  were as follows  in thousands amounts due by period obligation total monetary to to and obligations thereafter other operating leases convertible notes interest payments purchase obligations long term tax liability severance payments other total obligations our senior subordinated convertible notes mature on september  purchase obligations consist of both cancelable and non cancelable inventory and non inventory items 
approximately million of the total purchase obligations at december  related to metoprolol 
the difference between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to fasb asc income taxes represents an unrecognized tax benefit 
an unrecognized tax benefit is a liability that represents a potential future obligation to the taxing authorities 
as of december   the amount represents unrecognized tax benefits  interest and penalties based on evaluation of tax positions and concession on tax issues challenged by the irs 
we do not expect to make a significant tax payment related to these long term liabilities within the next year  however  we cannot estimate in which period thereafter such tax payments may occur 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that approximately million of our existing unrecognized tax positions may be recognized within the next twelve months as a result of settlements or a lapse of the statute of limitations 
for presentation on the table above  we included the related long term liability in the other column 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with third parties for the development of new products and technologies 
to date  we have entered into agreements and advanced funds and have commitments or contingent liabilities with several non affiliated companies for products in various stages of development 
these contingent payments or commitments are generally dependent on the third party achieving certain milestones or the timing of third party research and development or legal expenses 
due to the uncertainty of the timing and or realization of such contingent commitments  these obligations are not included in the contractual obligations table above as of december  payments made pursuant to these agreements are either capitalized or expensed in accordance with par s accounting policies 
the total amount that ultimately could be due under agreements with contingencies was approximately million as of december  this amount is exclusive of contingencies tied to the achievement of sales milestones  which will be funded through future revenue streams 
the agreements that contain such commitments are described in notes to consolidated financial statements note research and development agreements elsewhere in this form k

the notes bear interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually on march and september of each year 
the notes are convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  only upon the occurrence of certain events 
upon redemption  we have agreed to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash in an amount equal to the principal amount of the notes converted 
the notes mature on september  we may not redeem the notes prior to the maturity date 
in conjunction with the adoption of fasb asc  we allocated a portion of the senior subordinated convertible notes between liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s economic interest cost 
previous guidance provided for accounting of our type of convertible debt instruments entirely as debt 
the effect of fasb asc for our type of convertible debt instrument is that the equity component is included in the additional paid in capital section of stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheet and the value of the equity component is treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the convertible debt instruments 
fasb asc was effective as of january   with retrospective application required 
higher interest expense resulted through the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the debt instruments to their face amount over their term 
prior period interest expense was also higher than previously reported due to retrospective application 
as of december   our consolidated balance sheet reflects the debt amount of million  a related deferred tax liability amount of million and an equity component of million 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than disclosed operating leases 
subsequent events in the first quarter of  we reached a settlement with a third party of two litigations related to the enforcement of our patent rights and acquired intellectual property related to a product that was the subject of the litigations

the nda cannot be approved until the fda receives a satisfactory inspection report of the clinical and analytical sites for the bioequivalence study related to zuplenz tm 
the fda restriction on foreign travel in india has been subsequently lifted and the inspection of the clinical and analytical sites for the bioequivalence study related to zuplenz tm is in the process of being scheduled 
no issues related to the study data or film product were identified 
in february  optimer pharmaceutical corporation announced the successful completion of its second pivotal phase trial for fidaxomicin 
optimer plans to use the data from this study to support the submission of a nda 
this event triggers a million milestone payment from optimer to us per the february agreement between the companies 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies  as discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition and the determination of deductions from gross revenues  the determination of whether certain costs pertaining to our significant development and marketing agreements are to be capitalized or expensed as incurred  the valuation and assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and inventory valuation 
in applying such policies  management often must use amounts that are based on its informed judgments and estimates 
because of the uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
we are not aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition and provisions for deductions from gross revenues we recognize revenues for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to its customers  when reliable estimates of rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments can be made  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customers 
we also review available trade inventory levels at certain large wholesalers to evaluate any potential excess supply levels in relation to expected demand 
upon recognizing revenue from sales  we record estimates for the following items that reduce gross revenues chargebacks rebates and incentive programs product returns cash discounts and other medicaid rebates the following table summarizes the activity for the years ended december   and in the accounts affected by the estimated provisions described below  in thousands for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities unless specific in nature  the amount of provision or reversal of reserves related to prior periods for chargebacks is not determinable on a product or customer specific basis  however  based upon historical analysis and analysis of activity in subsequent periods  we have determined that our chargeback estimates remain reasonable 
includes amounts due to customers for which no underlying accounts receivable exists and is principally comprised of medicaid rebates and rebates due under other us government pricing programs 
we included additional amounts that were part of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  million in the table above that are similar to the previously disclosed amounts due to customers for which no underlying accounts receivable exists

the changes in accounts receivable reserves recorded for prior period sales related to returns principally comprised of the successful resolution in the twelve month period ended december  of a customer dispute over invalid customer deductions taken in prior periods of million  and an update to management s prior period returns estimates relating to the loss of a customer for certain products and new returns information that became available during the twelve month period ended december   of million

we sell our products directly to wholesalers  retail drug store chains  drug distributors  mail order pharmacies and other direct purchasers and customers that purchase products indirectly through the wholesalers  including independent pharmacies  non warehousing retail drug store chains  managed health care providers and other indirect purchasers 
we have entered into agreements at negotiated contract prices with those health care providers that purchase products through our wholesale customers at those contract prices 
chargeback credits are issued to wholesalers for the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler and the contract price through which the product is resold to health care providers 
approximately of our net product sales were derived from the wholesale distribution channel for the year ended december  and of our net product sales were derived from the wholesale distribution channel for the year ended december  the information that we consider when establishing our chargeback reserves includes contract and non contract sales trends  average historical contract pricing  actual price changes  processing time lags and customer inventory information from our three largest wholesale customers 
our chargeback provision and related reserve vary with changes in product mix  changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventory 
customer rebates and incentive programs are generally provided to customers as an incentive for the customers to continue carrying our products or replace competing products in their distribution channels with products sold by us 
rebate programs are based on a customer s dollar purchases made during an applicable monthly  quarterly or annual period 
we also provide indirect rebates  which are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased our products from a wholesaler under a contract with us 
the incentive programs include stocking or trade show promotions where additional discounts may be given on a new product or certain existing products as an added incentive to stock our products 
we may  from time to time  also provide price and or volume incentives on new products that have multiple competitors and or on existing products that confront new competition in order to attempt to secure or maintain a certain market share 
the information that we consider when establishing our rebate and incentive program reserves are rebate agreements with and purchases by each customer  tracking and analysis of promotional offers  projected annual sales for customers with annual incentive programs  actual rebates and incentive payments made  processing time lags  and for indirect rebates  the level of inventory in the distribution channel that will be subject to indirect rebates 
we do not provide incentives designed to increase shipments to our customers that we believe would result in out of the ordinary course of business inventory for them 
we regularly review and monitor estimated or actual customer inventory information at our three largest wholesale customers for our key products to ascertain whether customer inventories are in excess of ordinary course of business levels 
pursuant to a drug rebate agreement with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  tricare and similar supplemental agreements with various states  we provide a rebate on drugs dispensed under such government programs 
we determine our estimate of the medicaid rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and any new information regarding changes in the medicaid program that might impact our provision for medicaid rebates 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider historical payment rates  processing lag for outstanding claims and payments  and levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
we review the accrual and assumptions on a quarterly basis against actual claims data to help ensure that the estimates made are reliable 
on january   the fiscal year national defense authorization act was enacted  which expands tricare to include prescription drugs dispensed by tricare retail network pharmacies 
tricare rebate accruals reflect this program expansion and are based on actual and estimated rebates on department of defense eligible sales 
we accept returns of product according to the following criteria i the product returns must be approved by authorized personnel with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request and ii we generally will accept returns of products from any customer and will provide the customer with a credit memo for such returns if such products are returned between six months prior to  and months following  such products expiration date 
we record a provision for product returns based on historical experience  including actual rate of expired and damaged in transit returns  average remaining shelf lives of products sold  which generally range from to months  and estimated return dates 
additionally  we consider other factors when estimating our current period return provision  including levels of inventory in the distribution channel  significant market changes that may impact future expected returns  and actual product returns  and may record additional provisions for specific returns that it believes are not covered by the historical rates 
we offer cash discounts to our customers  generally of the sales price  as an incentive for paying within invoice terms  which generally range from to days 
we account for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts that we expect our customers to take 
in addition to the significant gross to net sales adjustments described above  we periodically make other sales adjustments 
we generally account for these other gross to net adjustments by establishing an accrual in the amount equal to our estimate of the adjustments attributable to the sale 
we may at our discretion provide price adjustments due to various competitive factors  through shelf stock adjustments on customers existing inventory levels 
there are circumstances under which we may not provide price adjustments to certain customers as a matter of business strategy  and consequently may lose future sales volume to competitors and risk a greater level of sales returns on products that remain in the customer s existing inventory 
as detailed above  we have the experience and access to relevant information that we believe are necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
some of the assumptions we use for certain of these estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as wholesale customer inventories and market data  or other market factors beyond our control 
the estimates that are most critical to the establishment of these reserves  and therefore  would have the largest impact if these estimates were not accurate  are estimates related to contract sales volumes  average contract pricing  customer inventories and return volumes 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjusts our reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
with the exception of the product returns allowance  the ending balances of accounts receivable reserves and allowances generally are processed during a two month to four month period 
research and development agreements we capitalize or expense amounts related to the development of new products and technologies through agreements with third parties based on our determination of our ability to recover in a reasonable period of time its cost from the estimated future cash flows anticipated to be generated pursuant to each agreement 
accordingly  amounts related to our funding of the research and development efforts of others or to the purchase of contractual rights to products that have not been approved by the fda  and where we have no alternative future use for the product  are expensed and included in research and development costs 
amounts for contractual rights acquired by us to a process  product or other legal right having multiple or alternative future uses that support its realizability  as well as to an approved product  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market value 
we establish reserves for our inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of the inventory is not expected to be recovered 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell such inventory  remaining shelf life  remaining contractual terms of any supply and distribution agreements including authorized generic agreements  and current expected market conditions  including level of competition 
we record provisions for inventory to cost of goods sold 
we capitalize costs associated with certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch pre launch inventories when it is reasonably certain that the pre launch inventories will be saleable  based on management s judgment of future commercial use and net realizable value 
the determination to capitalize is made once we or our third party development partners has filed an abbreviated new drug application that has been acknowledged by the fda for containing sufficient information to allow the fda to conduct their review in an efficient and timely manner and management is reasonably certain that all regulatory and legal hurdles will be cleared 
this determination is based on the particular facts and circumstances relating to the expected fda approval of the generic drug product being considered  and accordingly  the time frame within which the determination is made varies from product to product 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre launch inventories upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential risk factors 
if these risks were to materialize and the launch of such product were significantly delayed  we may have to write off all or a portion of such pre launch inventories and such amounts could be material 
as of december   we had pre launch inventories of million 
should any launch be delayed  inventory write offs may occur to the extent we are unable to recover the full value of our inventory investment 
the recoverability of the cost of pre launch inventories with a limited shelf life is evaluated based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding the timing of anticipated product launches  including our expected number of competitors during the six month period subsequent to any anticipated product launch 
further  we believe that the inventory balance at december  is recoverable based on anticipated launches and the related expected demand for lower priced generic products that may be substituted for referenced branded products upon fda approval 
goodwill and intangible assets we determine the estimated fair values of goodwill and certain intangible assets with definitive lives based on valuations performed by us at the time of their acquisition 
in addition  the fair value of certain amounts paid to third parties related to the development of new products and technologies  as described above  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets are reviewed quarterly  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested 
impairment of definite lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested 
as discussed above with respect to determining an asset s fair value  because this process involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis of the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
the critical estimates include projected future cash flows related to subject product sales and related estimated costs  assumptions related to the time value of money and weighted average cost of capital  the market capitalization of our company  and the implied value of our business relative to similar companies and relative to acquisitions involving similar companies 
for the nascobal nasal spray related intangible asset  the critical estimates include future projected prescriptions demand  and the operational execution of the related marketing and sales plan 
as of december   we determined through our estimates that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed 
we will continue to assess the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance and may in the future conclude that impairments exist 
events that may lead to future conclusions of impairment include product recalls  product supply issues  additional competition  pricing pressures from customers  competitors or governmental agencies  and or a decrease in our market capitalization 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note intangible assets  we impaired intangible assets with net carrying values of million in as a result of the acquisition of kali in  we have amounts recorded as goodwill of million at december  and december  in addition  intangible assets with definite lives  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million at december  and million at december  use of estimates in reserves we believe that our reserves  allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched or acquired products 
we review the rates and amounts in our allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease our reported net revenues  conversely  if actual product returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase our reported net revenues 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues that we report 
we regularly review the information related to these estimates and adjust our reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
use of forecasted financial information in accounting estimates the use of forecasted financial information is inherent in many of our accounting estimates  including determining the estimated fair value of goodwill and intangible assets  matching intangible amortization to underlying benefits eg sales and cash inflows  establishing and evaluating inventory reserves  and evaluating the need for valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
such forecasted financial information is based on numerous assumptions  including our ability to achieve  and the timing of  fda approval for pipeline products  our ability to successfully commercialize products in a highly competitive marketplace  the competitive landscape including the number of competitors for a product at its introduction to the market and throughout its product lifecycle and the impact of such competition on both sales volume and price  our market share and our competitors market share  our ability to execute and maintain contracts related to distributed products  which are products manufactured under contract and licensed products  the ability of our third party partners and suppliers to adequately perform their contractual obligations  our ability to maintain adequate product supply to meet market demand  the reimbursement landscape and its impact on pricing power  the product lifecycle  which for generic products is generally relatively short years  and which for branded products is generally longer years 
we believe that our financial forecasts are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
it is possible however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different forecasts and that the application of those forecasts could result in different valuations of certain assets on our balance sheet 
additionally  differences in actual experience versus forecasted experience could cause our valuations of certain assets to fluctuate 
these differences may be more prevalent in products that are newly launched  products that are newly acquired  and products that are at the end of their lifecycles or remaining contractual terms of any supply and distribution agreements including authorized generic agreements 
we regularly review the information related to these forecasts and adjust the carrying amounts of the applicable assets accordingly  if and when actual results differ from previous estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk available for sale debt securities the primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the intention to achieve the best available rate of return on traditionally low risk investments 
we do not buy and sell securities for trading purposes 
our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings  the us government and us governmental agencies 
we are subject to market risk primarily from changes in the fair values of our investments in debt securities including governmental agency and municipal securities  and corporate bonds 
these instruments are classified as available for sale securities for financial reporting purposes 
a ten percent increase in interest rates on december  would have caused the fair value of our investments in available for sale debt securities to decline by approximately million as of that date 
additional investments are made in overnight deposits and money market funds 
these instruments are classified as cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes  which generally have lower interest rate risk relative to investments in debt securities and changes in interest rates generally have little or no impact on their fair values 
for cash  cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities  a ten percent decrease in interest rates would decrease the interest income we earned by approximately million on an annual basis
