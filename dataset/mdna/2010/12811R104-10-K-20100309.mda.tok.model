item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation we provide investment advisory services to institutions and individuals  managing billion in client assets at december  through a variety of investment products designed to suit their investment needs 
assets under management our operating results fluctuate primarily due to changes in the total value and composition of our assets under management and with our ability to manage variable expenses 
the following table details our assets under management  based on the four types of investment product types we offer in the mutual fund and separate account categories  at december   and in millions mutual funds open end funds closed end funds total mutual funds separate accounts institutional accounts managed accounts total separate accounts total assets under management in order to increase our assets under management and expand our business  we must develop and market investment products and strategies that suit the investment needs of our target clients investors seeking superior risk adjusted returns over the long term 
the value and composition of our assets under management and our ability to continue to attract and retain clients will depend on a variety of factors  including  among others purchases and redemptions of shares of the open end funds and other investment products  the amount of non reinvested capital gain and income distributions  fluctuations in the global financial markets that result in appreciation or depreciation of assets under management  the use of leverage within the closed end funds  our ability to educate our target clients about our investment philosophy and provide them with best in class service  the relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products as compared to competing offerings and market indices  competitive conditions in the mutual fund  asset management and broader financial services sectors  investor sentiment and confidence  and our introduction of new investment strategies and products  and our decision to close strategies when deemed in the best interests of our clients 
investment products mutual funds mutual funds include registered open end funds and registered closed end funds 
open end funds 
open end funds are continually offered and are not listed on an exchange 
open end funds issue new shares for purchase and redeem shares from those shareholders who sell 
the share price for purchases 
table of contents and redemptions of open end funds is determined by each fund s net asset value  which is calculated at the end of each business day 
assets under management in open end funds vary as a result of both market appreciation and depreciation and the level of new purchases or redemptions of shares of a fund 
investment management fees  including performance based fees  are our principal source of revenue from open end mutual funds and are primarily derived from assets under management 
we offer several share classes in each open end fund to provide investors with alternatives to pay for commissions  distribution and service fees 
since our open end funds have included our dublin  ireland based calamos global funds plc  also referred to as offshore funds 
closed end funds 
closed end funds typically sell a finite number of shares to investors through underwritten public offerings 
after the public offerings  investors buy closed end fund shares from  and sell those shares to  other investors through an exchange or broker dealer market 
all of the closed end funds that we manage currently use leverage which increases their total assets 
assets under management in closed end funds vary due to the amount of assets raised in underwritten public offerings  the amount of leverage utilized and market appreciation or depreciation 
our revenues from closed end funds are derived from the investment management fees on the assets that we manage 
in addition  in a typical underwritten public offering  investors are charged a commission by the selling firms 
we do not receive or pay commissions in connection with sales of closed end fund shares  although we may pay asset based distribution and service fees  as well as one time distribution and service fees to underwriters for underwriting public offerings of closed end funds 
separate accounts separate accounts include institutional accounts and managed accounts for high net worth investors 
fund flows into and out of such accounts  which we refer to as purchases and redemptions  affect our level of assets under management 
assets under management from these accounts also vary as a result of market appreciation and depreciation 
our revenues from separate accounts are derived from investment management fees that we charge  including performance based fees where applicable 
provided below is a brief differentiation of these accounts institutional accounts are separately managed accounts for institutional investors  such as public and private pension funds  public funds  endowment funds and private investment funds 
institutional accounts also include sub advised portfolios  such as registered investment companies  where we act as investment advisor but for which we have no distribution responsibilities 
institutional accounts are typically offered directly by us through institutional consultants and through national and regional broker dealers 
managed accounts are separately managed accounts for high net worth investors offered primarily through national and regional broker dealers 
revenues our revenues are substantially comprised of investment management fees earned under contracts with the mutual funds and separate accounts managed by us 
the distribution of assets under management among our investment products also will have an impact on our investment management fees  as some products carry different fees than others 
investment management fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value and composition of our assets under management  the amount of non reinvested capital gain and income distributions  market appreciation or depreciation  the use of leverage within our products  relative investment performance and volatility of our investment products and strategies compared to benchmarks and competitors  level of net purchases and redemptions  which represent the sum of new client assets  additional funding from existing clients  withdrawals of assets from and termination of client accounts  and purchases and redemptions of mutual fund shares  
table of contents a determination by the independent trustees of the mutual funds to terminate or significantly alter the funds investment management agreements with us  and increased competition 
our revenues also are comprised of distribution and underwriting fees 
asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  discussed below  are a significant component of distribution and underwriting fees 
distribution and underwriting fees may fluctuate based on a number of factors  including the following total value and composition of our assets under management generally and by share class  market appreciation or depreciation  and the level of purchases and redemptions 
investment management fees investment management fees that we receive from mutual funds for which we act as investment advisor are computed monthly on an average daily net asset value basis 
investment management fees that we earn on separate accounts for which we act as investment advisor are generally computed quarterly  either in advance or in arrears  based on the assets under management at the beginning or end of the quarterly period 
we recognize the revenues derived from these fees over the period during which we render investment advisory services 
distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting fees include asset based distribution and or service fees received pursuant to rule b plans  front end sales charges and contingent deferred sales charges 
rule b distribution and or service fees are asset based fees that the open end funds pay us over time pursuant to distribution plans adopted under provisions of rule b of the investment company act 
these fees are typically calculated as a percentage of average daily net assets under management in specific share classes of the open end funds 
these fees fluctuate with both the level of average daily net assets under management and the relative mix of assets among share classes 
rule b fees are generally offset by distribution and service expenses paid during the period  as well as the amortization of deferred sales commissions that were previously paid by us to third parties 
we earn front end sales charges on the sale of class a shares of open end funds  which provide for a sales charge at the time of investment 
we retain a portion of the applicable sales charge and record as revenue only the portion that we retain 
we retain the entire sales charge earned on accounts where calamos financial services acts as the broker dealer 
sales charges are waived on sales to shareholders or intermediaries that exceed specified minimum dollar amounts and other specified conditions 
sales charges fluctuate with both the level of class a share sales and the mix of class a shares offered with and without a sales charge 
contingent deferred sales charges are earned on redemptions of class b shares within six years of purchase and on redemptions of class c shares within one year of purchase 
contingent deferred sales charges fluctuate primarily based on the length of the investment in class b and class c shares 
waivers of contingent deferred sales charges apply under certain circumstances 
other revenues other revenues consist primarily of portfolio accounting fees  which are contractual payments calculated as a percentage of combined assets of the mutual funds for financial accounting services  such as expense accruals and tax calculations 
the fees were calculated based on the average daily assets of the open end and closed end funds 

table of contents operating expenses our operating expenses consist of employee compensation and benefits  distribution and underwriting expenses  amortization of deferred sales commissions  marketing and sales promotion expenses  and general and administrative expenses 
these expenses fluctuate due to a number of factors  including but not limited to  the following variations in the level of total compensation expense due to  among other things  incentive compensation  changes in our employee count and mix  and competitive factors  changes in distribution and underwriting expense and amortization of the deferred sales commissions as a result of fluctuations in mutual fund sales and level of redemptions  market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management which will directly impact distribution and underwriting expenses  the amount of rule b distribution and or service fees that we receive  as well as our continued ability to receive those fees in the future  which would affect the amortization expenses associated with the receipt of these fees  changes in the level of our marketing and promotion expenses in response to market conditions  including our efforts to further penetrate our existing distribution channels  and expenses and capital costs  such as technology assets  professional services  depreciation  and research and development  incurred to maintain and enhance our administrative and operating services infrastructure 
we have and will continue to adjust the level of expenses relative to business income and seek opportunities to implement a more variable cost structure 
employee compensation and benefits employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  incentive compensation  and related benefits costs 
employee compensation and benefits are benchmarked against industry compensation standards 
in order to attract and retain qualified personnel  we must maintain competitive employee compensation and benefits 
in normal circumstances  as we grow  we expect to experience a general rise in employee compensation and benefits expenses over the long term 
we use a fair value method in recording compensation expense for restricted stock units and stock options granted under our incentive stock plan 
under the fair value method  compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period 
fair value is determined on the date granted using the black scholes option pricing model for the stock options and is determined by the market value of the underlying stock for restricted stock units 
distribution and underwriting expense distribution and underwriting expense includes payments that we make to broker dealers and other intermediaries for selling  underwriting  servicing and administering mutual funds 
this expense is influenced by new mutual funds sales  levels of redemptions and market appreciation or depreciation of assets under management in these products 
this expense is comprised of rule b distribution and or service fee payments to the selling firms 
amortization of deferred sales commissions as discussed above  we pay commissions to selling firms upon the sale of class b and c shares of open end funds 
as we pay these commissions  we create a deferred sales commission asset on our balance sheet 
we amortize these assets over either the average remaining lives of the assets or the period in which we receive related asset based distribution and or service fees pursuant to rule b plans 
amortization expenses generally offset the rule b fees we receive from the funds shareholders over this same period 
in addition  because rule b 
table of contents fees cease upon the redemption of open end fund shares  amortization expenses are accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in a reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
because we discontinued the sale of class b shares during  the deferred sales commission assets related to these shares are no longer being replenished by new sales 
in conjunction with this decision  we evaluated the estimated remaining lives on the portion of the deferred sales commission assets related to class b mutual fund shares and  as a result  extended the expected lives of these assets 
the impact of this change reduced amortization expense for the year ended december  other operating expenses other operating expenses include marketing and sales promotion expenses and general and administrative expenses 
marketing and sales promotion expenses generally vary based on the type and level of marketing  educational  sales or other programs in operation and include closed end fund marketing costs and ongoing and one time payments to broker dealers 
in addition  as the open end mutual funds that we manage have grown in size and recognition over time and in normal circumstances  we have become subject to supplemental compensation payments to third party selling agents  which are a component of marketing and sales promotion expense 
we expect supplemental compensation payments to fluctuate with changes in assets under management 
in connection with closed end funds  we make fee payments to certain underwriters for distribution  consulting and or support services rendered during or after the offering period of each closed end fund 
these fees are based on contractual agreements with underwriting firms and may be paid over time based on the average daily net assets of such funds or at the close of the offering period based on the amount of assets raised during the offering 
general and administrative expenses primarily include occupancy related costs  depreciation and professional and business services 
these expenses generally increase and decrease in relative proportion to the number of employees retained by us and the overall size and scale of our business operations 
we continue to explore ways to make these costs more variable  such as outsourcing our middle and back office functions 
impact of distribution and underwriting activities in order to gather assets under management  we engage in distribution and underwriting activities  principally with respect to our family of open end mutual funds 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we present distribution fees earned by us as revenues and distribution fees paid to selling firms and the amortization of deferred sales commissions as expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
however  when analyzing our business  we consider the result of these distribution activities as a net amount of revenue as they are typically a result of a single open end mutual fund share purchase 
hence  the result of presenting this information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is a reduction to our overall operating margin  as the margin on distribution activities is generally lower than the margins on our core investment management business 
the following table summarizes the net distribution fee margin for the years ended december  and in thousands distribution and underwriting fees distribution and underwriting expense amortization of deferred sales commissions net distribution fees net distribution fee margin net distribution fee margin varies by share class because each share class has different distribution and underwriting activities  which are described below 
class a shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  these shares provide for a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
the sales charge is equal to a maximum of of the amount invested 
we retain an underwriting fee representing a portion of this sales charge and pay any remaining amounts to the selling firm 
we retained underwriting fees of million for the year ended december  we receive rule b distribution and service fees on class a shares at a rate of 
table of contents of class a share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   we received class a share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class a share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the distribution fee margin that we earn on class a shares is largely driven by the distribution fees that we earn as broker of record and by the portion of front end sales charges that we retain  which fluctuate with both the total class a share sales and the mix of class a share sales with and without a sales charge 
the percentage of class a share sales made without a sales charge has been increasing 
if this trend continues  we expect that our class a share net distribution fee margin will decrease 
class b shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  during the second quarter of we discontinued the sale of class b open end mutual funds 
prior to us closing this share class to new sales  investors in class b shares did not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we paid an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment is made 
this advanced payment was capitalized as a deferred sales commission asset when paid and is amortized on a straight line basis over eight years unless a redemption occurs at which time we write off the remaining asset by increasing amortization expense 
for the year ended december   we made class b share commission payments to selling firms of million 
if the investor redeems shares within the first six years of investment  we receive a contingent deferred sales charge of between during the first year declining to during the sixth year of the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class b share contingent deferred sales charge payments of million 
we receive rule b fees on class b shares at the rate of of class b share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make rule b service fee payments to the selling firm at a rate of of class b share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
we retain a distribution fee to help us recover the upfront commissions that we paid to the selling firm 
rule b payments continue for eight years  at which point class b shares automatically convert into class a shares 
for the year ended december   we received class b share rule b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class b share rule b payments to selling firms of million 
the net distribution fee margin that we earn on class b shares is primarily the result of the difference between the annual distribution fee revenue that we receive on the average class b share assets under management and the amortization of the upfront commission over the life of the asset 
this differential creates a component of net distribution fee margin unique to class b shares that will remain constant before giving consideration to redemption activity or market appreciation or depreciation 
further  the net distribution fee margin on class b shares fluctuates due to the appreciation or depreciation of the underlying assets 
class c shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  investors in class c shares do not pay a sales charge at the time of investment  instead  we pay an upfront commission equal to of the amount invested directly to the selling firm when the investment is made 
this advanced payment is capitalized as a deferred sales commission asset when paid and is amortized on a straight line basis over months 
for the year ended december   we made commission payments to selling firms of million 
if the investor redeems class c shares within one year of investment  we receive from the proceeds of the sale a contingent deferred sales charge payment equal to of the lesser of the redemption price or purchase price 
for the year ended december   we received class c share contingent deferred sales charge payments of million 
we receive rule b fees on class c shares at the rate of of class c share assets under management consisting of a distribution fee and a service fee and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
we make class c share rule b distribution and service fee payments to the selling firm beginning in the second year following the sale at the rate of of class c share assets under management and record these payments as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december  we received class c share b fees of million 
for the same period  we made class c share rule b payments to selling firms of million 

table of contents the first year s rule b fees help us to recoup the upfront commission we paid to the selling firm  resulting in a net distribution fee margin on class c shares that is generally zero  before giving consideration to market appreciation or depreciation 
however  during the first months following the sale of class c shares  this margin will fluctuate due to the appreciation or depreciation of class c share assets 
appreciation or depreciation of the assets from the time of sale will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the distribution fee revenues 
we expect our distribution fee margin to increase as the underlying class c share assets appreciate and to decrease as these assets depreciate 
class i shares represented billion of our assets under management as of december  these shares do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees and are generally offered to individual and institutional investors making initial investments of million or more  therefore  no distribution fee margin exists for this share class 
class r shares were introduced in the first quarter of for purchase through certain tax exempt retirement plans held in plan level or omnibus accounts and represented million of our assets under management as of december  investors in class r shares do not pay a front end sales charge at the time of investment 
we receive rule b fees on class r shares at a rate of of class r share assets under management and record these fees as distribution and underwriting fee revenue 
these fees are generally offset by a fee paid to third party selling agents that is recorded as a distribution expense 
for the year ended december   the class r share b fees that we received and the class r share rule b payments that we made to selling firms were insignificant 
class x shares represented million of our assets under management as of december  these shares do not provide for a front end sales charge or rule b fees and are generally offered to individual and institutional investors making initial investments of million or more  therefore  no distribution fee margin exists for this share class 
currently  these shares are available only through our offshore funds to foreign investors 
the net distribution fee margin varies by share class so the mix of class a  class b  class c and class r share sales and assets affects the overall net distribution fee margin 
for  the class b share margin is significantly greater than the class a  class c and class r shares due to the reduction in amortization expense associated with the change in the estimated remaining lives of the class b deferred sales commissions 
the reduction in amortization contributed to the increased net distribution margin year over year 
we expect this increase to be temporary as the age of the assets under management increases and as the class c shares  with lower margins  continue to represent a larger percentage of our asset base 
non operating income loss non operating income loss primarily represents net investment gains or losses from a portion of our investment portfolio and from the limited partnerships that we consolidate  net of non controlling interest in those partnerships 
capital gain distributions  dividends and net interest income or expense are also reported as components of non operating income loss 
we expect to continue to invest a portion of our operating cash flow into investment securities  thus the impact of non operating income loss will continue to be meaningful in future periods

income loss before income tax provision benefit includes investment and dividend income earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments held solely by calamos asset management  inc during the same period 
this investment income is not reduced by any non controlling interest  therefore  the resulting non controlling interest is less than and for the years ended december  and  respectively

at december   we and our affiliates had and interests in calamos market neutral opportunities fund lp combined 
at december   we and our affiliates had and interests in calamos market neutral opportunities fund lp combined 
calamos partners llc was also the general partner of calamos equity opportunities fund lp  a private investment partnership  until the partnership was liquidated during the second quarter of we consolidated the financial results of these partnerships into our results 
the combined interests of the investments in these partnerships not owned by us are presented as non controlling interest in partnership investments in our consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we established calamos global funds plc  which is comprised of four ireland based offshore mutual funds 
until december  we owned a majority of the offshore funds and consolidated its results into ours 
however  we no longer own a majority of the offshore funds  and therefore  we no longer consolidate the financial results of the offshore funds into our results 
at december  and  we had and interests in the offshore funds  respectively 
as we launch new products  we and our affiliates may invest in these entities  which may require the consolidation of these entities into our results as well 
we expect the consolidation of these new entities to be temporary until new customers invest in the products and our resulting ownership percentage decreases 
income taxes for the years ended december   and  our effective tax rate was  and  respectively 
the tax rate does not give effect to the one time charge to income resulting from the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset to reflect the decrease in our illinois statutory tax rate 
operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  assets under management assets under management increased by billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  average assets under management decreased by billion  or  to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december  at

mutual fund net purchases were billion in  a favorable change of billion from billion of net redemptions in market appreciation was billion in compared to billion in depreciation for reflecting the positive changes in market conditions in versus our open end funds had billion of net purchases during in the fourth quarter of  we re opened our convertible fund for the first time since immediately following the re opening  the convertible fund started generating significant net purchases and continued to generate net purchases throughout additionally  we generated net purchases in of our mutual funds during the largest contributors to the increase were the convertible  total return bond  market neutral and high yield funds  as investors continued to gravitate towards lower risk and fixed income investment strategies 
market appreciation of billion was the main driver of asset growth in  while market depreciation of billion drove assets down in institutional and managed accounts had net redemptions of million in  a slight improvement when compared to million in net redemptions during we believe that the net redemptions during were primarily due to a reduction in investor s appetite to assume risk  leading to a shift away from equity strategies 
in addition  convertible strategies remained closed to new investors through our managed accounts 
market appreciation of billion in contributed to the growth in assets under management for the period while market depreciation of billion in added to the net redemptions 
one time items results of operations for were impacted by a significant one time expense 
developments in the illinois tax statutes resulted in modifications to the company s state tax apportionment methodology that lowered the company s statutory income tax rate from percent to percent 
while we view this to be beneficial for the long term by 
table of contents reducing income taxes  we recorded a one time  non cash income tax expense of million  or per diluted share  in the second quarter of to revalue our net deferred tax assets to reflect the new statutory income tax rate 
we consider results adjusted for this one time expense  as presented below  to provide a better indication of our operations 
this adjusted item is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
in evaluating operating performance  we consider operating expenses  operating income  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share  each calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  and each item on an as adjusted basis  which constitute non gaap financial measures 
items presented on an as adjusted basis exclude the impact of the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in the second quarter of as this one time item is not expected to recur  we believe that excluding this item better enables us to evaluate our operating performance relative to the prior periods 
we consider these non gaap financial measures when evaluating our performance and believe the presentation of these amounts provides the reader with information necessary to analyze our operations for the periods compared 
reconciliations of these measurements from the most directly comparable gaap financial measures for the twelve months ended december  is provided in the table below and should be carefully evaluated by the reader in thousands net loss net deferred tax assets revaluation net loss  as adjusted diluted loss per share net deferred tax assets revaluation diluted loss per share  as adjusted financial review revenues total revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to lower investment management fees and distribution and underwriting fees 
change in thousands amount percent investment management fees distribution and underwriting fees other total revenues compared to the prior year  investment management fees decreased in primarily due to a billion  or  decrease in average assets under management across all products 
investment management fees from open end funds decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  primarily due to decreases in open end fund average assets under management of billion  or  for compared to the prior year 
investment management fees from our institutional and managed accounts decreased to million from million primarily due to an approximate billion decrease in average assets under management 
investment management fees from our closed end funds decreased to million for from million for as a result of a billion decrease in closed end fund average assets under management 
investment management fees  in total  as a percentage of average assets under management were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
distribution and underwriting fees decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in distribution fees resulting from a decrease in open end fund average assets under management and a million decrease in contingent deferred sales charge fees  which change with the levels of class b and class c share redemptions 

table of contents operating expenses operating expenses decreased to million  or  for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this change was primarily due to reduced employee compensation and benefits  distribution and underwriting expense  and reduced amortization of deferred sales commission 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution and underwriting expense amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses as part of the company wide cost containment efforts that began in  employee compensation and benefits expense decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year primarily reflecting the full year impact of the reduction in staffing levels that occurred throughout and early salary  severance pay and related benefit expenses decreased by million from to  which was partially offset by a million increase in performance related incentive compensation  which remain significantly below potential payout levels 
distribution and underwriting expense decreased by million for when compared to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease of million in rule b expenses resulting from lower average open end funds under management of billion  or 
also contributing to the lower expenses was a reduction in average class c share assets older than one year 
class c share assets do not generate distribution expense in the first year following their sale because we retain the rule b fees during that first year to offset the upfront commissions that we pay 
however  class c share assets do generate a distribution expense in subsequent years  as we pass along the rule b fees to the selling firms 
although the rule b fee rates we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we expect distribution expense to vary with the change in open end fund assets under management and with the age of the class c share assets 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased million for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the prior year period resulting from the company s decision in the second quarter of to discontinue the sale of class b mutual funds 
as a result of our decision to discontinue class b share sales  the deferred sales commission assets will cease to be replenished by new sales and  therefore  we evaluated the estimated useful lives of the remaining assets 
based on this analysis  we extended the lives  or period over which we will amortize the remaining expense  effectively reducing the expense recorded in each period 
the impact of this change reduced the amortization of deferred sales commissions by approximately million on a quarterly basis 
marketing and sales promotion expense decreased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  primarily due to a decrease of million in supplemental distribution payments to intermediaries 
these fees are mostly calculated based on assets under management and the decrease correlates with the lower average assets under management for when compared to general and administrative expense decreased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period 
the overall decline in these expenses reflects our continued focus on expense control initiated in and mostly represents reduced expenses for occupancy  professional services  and travel and entertainment 
the impact of our move towards a variable cost structure  specifically the outsourcing of the middle and back office functions  will be more fully realized in future periods 
we expect that these increases in general and administrative expenses will be generally reflected as reductions in employee compensation and benefits expenses

table of contents mutual fund net redemptions were billion in  an unfavorable change of billion from billion of net redemptions in market depreciation was billion in  was billion in appreciation in and was the primary contributor to the deterioration in assets under management for our open end funds had billion of net redemptions during we believe that the net redemptions were largely due to the global financial market meltdown which led to large  industry wide flight to safety by investors 
net redemptions were affected by million of redemptions by the company used to pre pay debt 
in the fourth quarter of  we re opened our convertible fund for the first time since to take advantage of the broad sell off in the convertible markets that had created unprecedented opportunities for long term investors 
immediately following the opening  the convertible fund started generating significant net purchases 
in addition to the convertible fund  we experienced net purchases in a number of our mutual funds  including our total return bond fund and the newly launched equity fund and evolving world growth fund 
market depreciation of billion was the main driver of asset depletion in  while market appreciation of billion helped offset net redemptions in the liquidity crisis in the auction rate securities market during the first quarter of led to the refinancing of the equity securities issued by the closed end funds with more traditional debt financing 
while the proceeds of those debt financings remain a component of assets under management  certain regulatory and contractual constraints require total assets in closed end funds to be at least three times the amount of debt leverage  which is higher than the asset coverage required when using equity leverage 
the global meltdown that affected security values required us to reduce billion of leverage used by our closed end funds during that we reported as net redemptions 
separate accounts had net redemptions of million in  an improvement of nearly million when compared to billion in net redemptions during we believe that the net redemptions during were primarily due to the significant market decline which occurred in the fourth quarter of separate account net redemptions were also affected by million in redemptions by the company used to pre pay debt in the fourth quarter 
market depreciation of billion in also contributed to the deterioration in assets under management for the period while market appreciation of billion in offset net redemptions 
one time items results of operations for and were significantly impacted by certain one time expenses 
in  developments in the illinois tax statutes resulted in modifications to the company s state tax apportionment methodology that lowered the company s statutory income tax rate from percent to percent 
while we view this to be beneficial for the long term by reducing income taxes  we recorded a one time  non cash income tax expense of million  or per diluted share  in the second quarter of to revalue our net deferred tax assets to reflect the new statutory income tax rate 
the period was impacted by two one time marketing and sales promotion expenses 
during the second quarter of  we incurred a one time expense of million  or cents per diluted share  by terminating our remaining two supplemental compensation agreements that required us to make recurring payments of approximately million annually based on the assets of calamos convertible opportunities and income fund and calamos strategic total return fund 
additionally  we incurred a million  or cents per diluted share  one time structuring fee related to the launch of the calamos global dynamic income fund chw during the second quarter of we consider results adjusted for these one time expenses  as presented below  to provide a better indication of our operations 
these adjusted items are considered non gaap financial measures as defined by the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
in evaluating operating performance  we consider operating expenses  operating income  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share  each calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  and each item on an as adjusted basis  which constitute non gaap financial measures 
items presented on an as adjusted basis exclude the impact of the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in the second quarter of and the impact of terminating the two closed end fund additional compensation agreements and the chw closed end fund structuring fees in the second quarter of as these one time items are not expected to recur  we believe that excluding these items better enables us to evaluate our operating performance relative to the prior periods 
we consider these non gaap financial measures

table of contents compared to the prior year  investment management fees decreased in primarily due to a billion decrease in average assets under management across all products 
investment management fees from open end funds decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year  primarily due to decreases in open end fund average assets under management of billion for compared to the prior year 
investment management fees from our separately managed accounts decreased to million from million primarily due to an approximate billion decrease in average assets under management 
investment management fees from our closed end funds decreased to million for from million for as a result of a million decrease in closed end fund average assets under management mainly attributable to the deleveraging in the third and fourth quarters of investment management fees  in total  as a percentage of average assets under management were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
distribution and underwriting fees decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in distribution fees as a result of a decrease in open end fund average assets under management and a million decrease within contingent deferred sales charge fees  when compared to the prior year 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
this change was due to two significant one time marketing and sales promotion charges totaling million that were incurred in the second quarter of and to lower employee compensation and benefits  and distribution and underwriting expenses 
operating expenses  as adjusted  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
change in thousands amount percent employee compensation and benefits distribution and underwriting expense amortization of deferred sales commissions marketing and sales promotion general and administrative total operating expenses during  we initiated a series of cost containment efforts seeking to align the size and costs of our operations with a shrinking asset base  revenues and capital structure 
these efforts began early in with the reduction of associates 
additional efforts have been made to contain costs through staff reductions in november of associates with the reorganization of our information technology function and finally in january with the reduction of more than associates across all aspects of our business  other than our core investment management team 
compensation expenses were not the only focus of our cost cutting initiatives  rather  we have focused on further reducing our cost structure by delaying or canceling information technology projects  reducing capitalized costs  transforming fixed costs to variable by exploring outsourcing alternatives and limiting discretionary spending 
these efforts have continued into  and we expect that our expenses unrelated to our assets under management will continue to decrease from past levels 
employee compensation and benefits expense decreased by million for the year ended december  when compared to the prior year primarily reflecting reductions in performance related expenses  such as incentive compensation and benefit plan contributions 
this decrease also reflects the impact of staff reductions described above to right size the company in response to support reduced asset levels 
distribution and underwriting expense decreased by million for when compared to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease of million resulting from the reduction in the class c share assets older than one 
table of contents year 
this decrease was compounded by a decrease of million in b expenses due to a decrease in average open end fund assets under management 
class c share assets do not generate distribution expense in the first year following their sale because we retain the rule b fees during that first year to offset the upfront commissions that we pay 
however  class c share assets do generate a distribution expense in subsequent years  as we pass along the rule b fees to the selling firms 
although the rule b fee rates we paid to broker dealers and other intermediaries in did not change from the rates paid in the prior year  we expect distribution expense to vary with the change in open end fund assets under management and with the age of the class c share assets 
amortization of deferred sales commissions decreased million for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the prior year period  due to a decrease in class c share sales during and to the decrease in the acceleration of amortization associated with class b share redemptions which were lower in marketing and sales promotion expense decreased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the year ended december  this decrease was mainly due to two one time expenses totaling million in during the second quarter of  we incurred a one time expense of million by terminating our remaining two agreements that required annual payments based on the assets of two closed end funds and a one time million structuring fee in connection with the chw initial public offering 
marketing and sales promotion expenses during were also reduced by lower supplemental distribution payments resulting from the decrease in assets under management 
general and administrative expense increased by million for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year period 
occupancy related and depreciation expenses to support our expansion of office facilities  which we contracted for in november  increased by million in when compared to significant reductions in expense were realized in the second half of  a result of our expense control efforts as previously discussed

other long term obligations principally represent commitments under the incentive compensation plan 
these obligations are included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements 
a thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
management believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used 
deferred sales commissions deferred sales commissions represent amounts advanced by us to the selling firm upon sale of class b and class c shares of open end funds 
deferred sales commissions are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which b fees are received 
because b fees cease upon redemption of shares  amortization expense is accelerated when shares are redeemed  resulting in the reduction of the deferred sales commission asset 
these 
table of contents redemptions result in an amortization period not to exceed months for class c shares and months eight years for class b shares 
we evaluate the carrying value of our deferred sales commissions for impairment on an annual basis 
significant assumptions utilized by us to estimate future average assets under management include expected future market performance and redemption rates 
estimates of undiscounted future cash flows and the remaining life of the deferred sales commission asset are made from these assumptions 
market performance assumptions are selected using expected average market returns based on long term market index benchmarks for each asset class held within the fund 
as of our most recent analysis  we used average market return assumptions ranging from to based on asset class 
higher actual average market returns would increase undiscounted cash flows  while lower actual average market returns would decrease undiscounted future cash flows 
future redemption assumptions were determined by using the average annual redemption rates that each fund experienced over the prior month period 
for class b shares and class c shares  we used average historical redemption rates of and  respectively 
an increase in the actual rate of redemptions would decrease the undiscounted future cash flows  while a decrease in the actual rate of redemptions would increase undiscounted cash flows 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually  or when events or changes in circumstances occur that could significantly increase the risk of impairment of the asset 
if we determine that the deferred sales commission asset is not recoverable  an impairment condition would exist and a loss would be measured as the amount by which the recorded amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the carrying value of the deferred sales commission asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the asset is written down to fair value based on discounted cash flows 
impairment adjustments are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of amortization of deferred sales commissions 
as of each reporting period presented  we determined that no impairment of the deferred commission asset existed  but due to the volatility of the capital markets and the changes in redemption rates  we are unable to predict whether or when future impairment of the deferred sales commission asset might occur 
compensation plans we have an incentive compensation plan that provides for grants of restricted stock unit awards  or rsus  and stock option awards for certain employees 
rsus are convertible on a one for one basis into shares of our common stock 
we estimate the fair value of the stock options as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model  and recognize the cost of stock based compensation based on the grant date fair value of the award 
further  we estimate the number of forfeited awards at the grant date 
actual forfeitures may vary from our assumptions  which will result in modifications to future expenses 
income tax provision benefit management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which principally related to our step up in tax basis to fair market value for our intangible assets under our election to be made under section of the internal revenue code and to our net capital loss carryforward 
in the event that sufficient taxable income of the same character does not result in future years  among other things  a valuation allowance for certain of our deferred tax assets may be required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as investment advisors for the mutual funds and separate accounts we manage 
a significant majority of our operating revenue  approximately for the year ended december   is derived from investment advisory  distribution and portfolio accounting agreements with the mutual funds and separate accounts 
under these agreements  the fees we receive are typically based on the market value of the assets under management 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease or by causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk 
in addition  a decline in the prices of securities may present market conditions that could preclude us from increasing assets under management and prevent us from realizing higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
we are also subject to market risk due to a decline in the prices of investment securities and partnership investments 
we own investment securities primarily comprised of products we manage 
the following table provides a sensitivity analysis of changes in fair value of our investment securities and partnership investments assuming a increase or decrease in the price of these instruments investment partnership investment partnership in thousands securities investments securities investments fair value fair value assuming price changes of increase decrease at december   we had an aggregate of million of long term debt outstanding  which consisted of senior unsecured notes of million of notes due april   million of notes due july   million of notes due july  and million of notes due july  as these notes have fixed interest rates  we do not believe that they have any interest rate risk 
due to the nature of our business  we believe that we do not face any material credit risk  inflation  interest rate or foreign currency rate risk
