item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent results and fiscal year end financial condition for the fiscal year ended june   total revenue increased  to million from million during fiscal freight revenue  which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges  increased  to million in fiscal from million in we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal we believe that an improving freight market and decreased industry wide trucking capacity in fiscal compared to fiscal were the major factors that contributed to our increase in net income 
increased freight demand due to the rebounding economy caused an increase in truck utilization measured by miles per tractor unless otherwise indicated operating statistics exclude jaguar 
our gains from increased freight demand were partially offset by the effects of shippers who had used the less robust freight market to reduce freight rates in fiscal as a result  average freight revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge for decreased per mile to  a decrease compared with per mile for average freight revenue per tractor per week  our main measure of ass et productivity  increased by to  in compared with  for this increase was due to higher general freight demand and a decrease in non revenue miles 
as the freight market began to strengthen  we ran less empty miles to get to our next load and position equipment for sale 
our operating margin  excluding the effect of fuel surcharge which is calculated as the percentage of operating expenses net of fuel surcharge over trucking revenue  decreased to for compared with for at june   our total balance sheet debt was million and our total stockholders equity was million  for a total debt to capitalization ratio net of cash of 
at june   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and million of cash on hand 
revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  other trucking related services  and from truckersbb 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  the number of tractors operating  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate to  among other things  the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  driver availability  and our average length of haul 
we eliminate fuel surcharges from revenue  when calculating operating ratios and some of our operating data 
we believe that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
expenses and profitability the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which we record as purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed cost is the acquisition and financing of long term assets  primarily revenue equipment 
we have other mostly fixed costs  such as our non driver personnel and facilities expenses 
in discussing our expenses as a percent age of revenue  we sometimes discuss changes as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharges  in addition to absolute dollar changes  because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful at times than absolute dollar changes 

table of contents the trucking industry has experienced significant increases in expenses over the past several years  in particular those relating to equipment costs  driver compensation  insurance  and fuel 
as the united states economy slowed down  many trucking companies were forced to lower freight rates to keep their trucks moving 
as the economy has started to improve  we are increasing rates as contracts expire or as the spot quote market allows 
over the long term  we expect a limited pool of qualified drivers and intense competition to recruit and retain those drivers to constrain overall industry capacity 
assuming a return to economic growth in us manufacturing  retail  and other high volume shipping industries  we expect to be able to raise freight rates in line with or faster than expenses 
revenue equipment we operate  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors at june    were owned   were acquired under operating leases  and were provided by independent contractors  who own and drive their own tractors 
of our trailers at june    were owned and  were acquired under operating leases and  were acquired under capital leases 
we use a combination of cash and operating leases to acquire our new tractors 
most of our new trailers are acquired with operating leases 
these leases generally run for a period of seven years for trailers 
when we finance revenue equipment acquisitions with operating leases  rather than borrowings or capital leases  the interest component of our financing activities is recorded as an above the line operating expense on our statements of operations 
independent contractors owner operators provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractors 
the payments to independent contractors are recorded in purchased transportation and the payments for equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals 
expenses associated with independent contractors  such as interest  depreciation  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred by the company 
because obtaining equipment from independent contractors and through operating leases effectively shifts these expenses from interest to above the line operating expenses  we evaluate our efficiency using our operating ratio as well as income before income taxes 
outlook looking forward  our profitability goal is to return our operating ratio to the low s in the near term and subsequently achieve an operating ratio of less than 
we expect this to require improvements in rate per mile and miles per tractor and decreased non revenue miles 
because a large percentage of our costs are variable  changes in revenue per mile affect our profitability to a greater extent than changes in miles per tractor 
for fiscal  the key factors that we expect to have the greatest effect on our profitability are our freight revenue per tractor per week which will be affected by the general freight environment  including the balance of freight demand and industry wide trucking capacity  our compensation of drivers  our cost of revenue equipment particularly in light of the epa engine requirements  our fuel costs  and our insurance and claims 
to overcome cost increases and improve our margins  we will need to achieve increases in freight revenue per tractor 
operationally  we will seek improvements in safety  driver recruiting  and retention 
our success in these areas primarily will affect revenue  driver related expenses  and insurance and claims expense 
given the unstable economy  we believe achieving our near term profitability goal will be difficult to achieve 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth the percentage relationship of revenue and expense items to operating and freight revenue for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation and amortization revenue equipment rentals purchased transportation cost of products and services sold communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other expense interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income freight revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation and amortization revenue equipment rentals purchased transportation cost of products and services sold communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other expense interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income freight revenue is total operating revenue less fuel surcharges 
in this table  fuel surcharges are eliminated from revenue and subtracted from fuel expense 
the amounts were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue excludes million and million of fuel surcharge revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
freight revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in freight demand  due to the slowly recovering economy 
this increase was partially attributable to an increase in billed miles to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and offset slightly by a decrease in average freight revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  to from 
average freight revenue per tractor per week  excluding fuel surcharge  which is our primary measure of asset productivity  increased to  in fiscal  from  for fiscal  as a result of increasing general freight demand  an increase in miles  partially offset by lower rates 
our freight rates began to impr ove at the end of the third quarter and continued to improve throughout the fourth quarter 
we expect our freight rates to maintain an upward trend through the end of the year as industry capacity continues to tighten 
revenue for truckersbb remained unchanged at million in fiscal and fiscal revenue was flat as truckersbb continues to operate in a challenging environment as smaller fleets have been forced out of business by the economy and difficult operating conditions and many of those remaining have cut back on purchases 
to the extent small and mid size carriers continue to be affected adversely by the weakened economy  lagging freight demand  limited financing availability  and licensing  insurance  and other costs  we anticipate the revenue for truckersbb to be negatively impacted as well 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal this slight dollar increase in salaries  wages  and benefits is largely due to increased driver payroll related to increased miles and increases in stock appreciation rights expenses as the stock price has increased 
these were offset by a reduction in administrative payroll  due to the efforts in the latter part of fiscal to eliminate or consolidate several functions  therefore reducing payroll expense 
also offsetting this increase was a reduction in driver pay per mile and a reduction in our driver recruiting costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal however  the increased freight revenue resulted in a dec rease in salaries  wages  and employee benefits as a percentage of freight revenue 
fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases were attributable to an increase in gallons purchased due to increased miles driven  offset by a decrease in average fuel prices to per gallon for fiscal  from per gallon for fiscal we expect that our continued efforts to reduce idling and operate more fuel efficient tractors will continue to have a positive impact on our miles per gallon  however  we expect this will be partially offset by lower fuel economy on epa mandated new engines 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  physical damage  and tire expense 
this category increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the dollar increase in fiscal is primarily related to an increase in costs associated with tire and physical damage expenses 
however  these factors were offset by a decrease in tractor maintenance and miscellaneous direct operating expenses 
insurance and claims expense increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue for fiscal insurance consists of premiums for liability  physical damage  cargo damage  and workers compensation insurance 
this increase is attributable to an increase in workers compensation claims  liability claims  and cargo claims expense  due to an increase in the number and or severity of claims reported including loss development 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
 we continually review and revise our insurance program to maintain a balance between premium expense and the risk retention we are willing to assume 
we expect our insurance and claims expense to revert to more historical averages going forward 

table of contents depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  decreased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases are related to a decrease in the number of owned tractors 
these decreases are partially offset by a slight increase in losses on sales of equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal to the extent the used equipment market remains weak going forward  we expect to face difficulty selling equipment in quantities and at prices that are satisfactory to us 
revenue equipment held under operating leases is not reflected on our balance sheet and the expenses related to such equipment are reflected on our statements of operations in revenue equipment rental s  rather than in depreciation and amortization and interest expense  as is the case for revenue equipment that is financed with borrowings or capital leases 
revenue equipment rentals increased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the majority of these increases are related to an increased number of leased tractors which is partially offset by increased lease rentals from our lease purchase program 
purchased transportation increased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the majority of these increases are related to increased miles by our independent contractor fleet 
the number of independent contractors increased to at june   compared with at june  independent contractors are drivers who cover all their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
in addition  our brokerage and intermodal expenses are increasing year over year as we continue to develop and increase those offerings 
going forward  depending on outside factors such as the freight environment confronting our industry and the str ength of the us economy  in general  we may decide to increase the number of independent contractors we engage 
accordingly  to the extent we increase the number of independent contractors in our fleet and continue to increase our purchased transportation for brokerage and intermodal transportation  we expect purchased transportation to increase as well 
all of our other expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
accordingly  we have not provided a detailed discussion of such expenses 
our pretax margin  which we believe is a useful measure of our operating performance because it is neutral with regard to the method of revenue equipment financing that a company uses  increased basis points to of freight revenue for fiscal  from for fiscal in addition to other factors described above  canadian exchange rate fluctuations principally impact salaries  wages  and benefits and purchased transportation and  therefore  impact our pretax margin and results of operations 
the higher canadian dollar  which increased to an average 
relationship with the us dollar for fiscal  from an average 
relationship with the us dollar for fiscal  negatively impacted earnings per share by approximately 
income taxes increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  resulting from a higher pre tax income 
due to the non deductible effects of our driver per diem pay structure  our tax rate will fluctuate from the standard federal rate  in future periods as net income fluctuates 
going forward  we expect our effective tax rate will be around to 
income tax expense for fiscal included an adjustment of approximately  related to per diem calculations for prior years 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june total revenue decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue excludes million and million of fuel surcharge revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
freight revenue decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in freight demand and rates  due to a weakened economy and the difficult freight market and aggressive rate environment confronting our industry 
this decrease was also attributable to a decrease in billed miles to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal  and a decrease in average freight revenue per total mile  excluding fuel surcharge  to from 
average freight revenue per tractor per week  excluding fuel surcharge  which is our primary measure of asset productivity  decreased to  in fisc al  from  for fiscal  as a result of lower general freight demand  a decrease in miles and rates  partially offset by an increase in fleet size 
the decrease in miles per tractor and an increase in non revenue miles were also attributable to less freight demand 

table of contents revenue for truckersbb was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease was related to decreases in fuel and tire rebate revenue due to small and mid size carriers being adversely affected by the lagging freight demand 
salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the dollar decrease in salaries  wages  and benefits is largely due to decreased driver payroll related to decreased miles 
additionally  decreases in administrative payroll resulting from ongoing efforts to consolidate and or eliminate several functions into indianapolis from various terminals  which plan reduced our non driver administrative workforce by approximately  also decreased our salaries  wages  and benefits 
however  these factors were more than offset by reduced freight revenue resulting in an increase in salaries  wages  and employee benefits as a percentage of freight revenue 
fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  decreased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases were attributable to a decrease in average fuel prices to per gallon for fiscal  from per gallon for fiscal  and a decrease in the gallons purchased due to fewer miles driven and increased miles per gallon related to reduced idling and operating more fuel efficient tractors 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  physical damage  and tire expense 
this category decreased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the dollar decrease in fiscal is primarily related to a decrease in costs associated with tractor maintenance  other maintenance expenses  and physical damage expenses 
however  these factors were more than offset by an increase in tire expense and miscellaneous direct operating expenses 
insurance and claims expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of freight revenue  insurance and claims remained constant at for fiscal and insurance consists of premiums for liability  physical damage  cargo damage  and workers compensation insurance 
the decrease in the overall dollar amount is attributable to a decrease in workers compensation claims and cargo claims expense  due to a reduction in the number and severity of claims reported 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
we continually revise and change our insurance program to maintain a balance between premium expense and the risk retention we are willing to assume 
depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment  increased to million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases are related to an increase year over year in the number of owned tractors and trailers 
these increases are partially offset by gains on sales of equipment in fiscal compared to losses on sales of equipment in fiscal revenue equipment held under operating leases is not reflected on our balance sheet and the expenses related to such equipment are reflected on our statements of operations in revenue equipment rentals  rather than in depreciation and amortization and interest expense  as is the case for revenue equipment that is financed with borrowings or c apital leases 
revenue equipment rentals were million  or of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the majority of these increases are related to the net addition of approximately tractors and trailers under operating lease  which has increased our tractor and trailer rents 

table of contents purchased transportation decreased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal the majority of these decreases are related to fewer miles by our independent contractor fleet  which averaged independent contractors in fiscal  compared to an average of independent contractors in fiscal  and a reduction of the fuel surcharge component of their pay resulting from decreased fuel costs 
independent contractors are drivers who cover all their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
all of our other expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
accordingly  we have not provided a detailed discussion of such expenses 
our pretax margin  which we believe is a useful measure of our operating performance because it is neutral with regard to the method of revenue equipment financing that a company uses  decreased basis points to of freight revenue for fiscal from for fiscal in addition to other factors described above  canadian exchange rate fluctuations principally impact salaries  wages  and benefits and purchased transportation and  therefore  impact our pretax margin and results of operations 
the lower canadian dollar  which decreased to an average

income taxes decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal  due to lower pre tax income 
due to the non deductible effects of our driver per diem pay structure  our tax rate will fluctuate from the standard federal rate  in future periods as net income fluctuates 
income tax expense for fiscal included an adjustment of approximately  related to per diem calculations for prior years 
as a result of the factors described above  net income decreased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources trucking is a capital intensive business 
we require cash to fund our operating expenses other than depreciation and amortization  to make capital expenditures and acquisitions  and to repay debt  including principal and interest payments 
other than ordinary operating expenses  we anticipate that capital expenditures for the acquisition of revenue equipment will constitute our primary cash requirement over the next twelve months 
we frequently consider potential acquisitions  and if we were to consummate an acquisition  our cash requirements would increase and we may have to modify our expected financing sources for the purchase of tractors 
subject to any required lender approval  we may make acquisitions  although we do not have any specific acquisition plans at this time 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated fro m operations  bank borrowings  capital and operating lease financing of revenue equipment  and proceeds from the sale of used revenue equipment 
as of june   we had on order tractors for delivery through fiscal these revenue equipment orders represent a capital commitment of approximately million  before considering the proceeds of equipment dispositions 
in fiscal  we purchased our new tractors with primarily off balance sheet operating leases  but in some instances cash or borrowings 
at june   our total balance sheet debt  including capital lease obligations and current maturities  was million  compared to million at june   and million at june  our debt to capitalization ratio net of cash total balance sheet debt minus cash on hand as a percentage of total balance sheet debt plus total stockholders equity was at june   at june   and at june  we believe we will be able to fund our operating expenses  as well as our current commitments for the acquisition of revenue equipment  over the next twelve months with a combination of cash generated from operations  borrowings available under secured equipment financing or our primary credit facility  equipment sales  and lease financing arrangements 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  and the availability of the needed capital will depend upon our financial condition and operating results and numerous other factors over which we have limited or no control  including prevailing market conditions and the market price of our common stock 
however  based on our operating results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under our credit facility  and sources of equipment lease finan cing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 

table of contents cash flows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operations in fiscal from fiscal is due primarily to an increase in trade receivables and a decrease in depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the increase in cash used for investing activities from to was primarily due to increased capital expenditures on equipment and decreased proceeds from sale of equipment  offset by the purchase of continental for million in fiscal capital expenditures primarily for tractors and trailers including lease buyouts and new equipment purchases totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  excluding the assets purchased from continental  and million in fiscal we generated proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal div net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the decreased payments on our borrowings and long term debt  as we paid the balance of our revolving line of credit down to during fiscal  our mortgaged equipment debt was paid down 
financing activity represents bank borrowings new borrowings  net of repayments and payment of the principal component of capital lease obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases have been an important source of financing for our revenue equipment 
our operating leases include some under which we do not guarantee the value of the asset at the end of the lease term walk away leases and some under which we do guarantee the value of the asset at the end of the lease term residual value 
therefore  we are subject to the risk that equipment value may decline in which case we would suffer a loss upon disposition and be required to make cash payments because of the residual value guarantees 
we were obligated for residual value guarantees related to operating leases of million at june  compared to million at june  a small portion of these amounts is covered by repurchase and or trade agreements we have with the equipment manufacturer 
we believe that any residual payment obligations that are not covered by the manufacturer will be satisfied  in the aggregate  by the value of the related equipment at the end of the lease 
to the extent the expected value at the lease termination date is lower than the residual value guarantee  we would accrue for the difference over the remaining lease term 
we anticipate that going forward we will use a combination of operating leases and cash generated from operations to finance tractor purchases and operating leases to finance trailer purchases 
the use of operating leases also affects our statement of cash flows 
for assets subject to these operating leases  we do not record depreciation as an increase to net cash provided by operations  nor do we record any entry with respect to investing activities or financing activities 
primary credit agreement on september   celadon group  inc  celadon trucking services  inc  and truckersbb entered into an unsecured credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  na formerly lasalle bank national association  as administrative agent  and bank of america  na  fifth third bank central indiana  and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as lenders 
the credit agreement was amended on december   by the first amendment to credit agreement  pursuant to which celadon logistics services  inc was added as a borrower to the credit agreement 
the credit agreement was also amended on june  and january  by the second amendment to credit agreement and third amendment to credit agreement  respectively 
on august   the credit agreem ent was amended and restated the restatement 
pursuant to the restatement  i the maximum available borrowing limit under the credit agreement was reduced from a million unsecured line to a million secured line and ii certain financial covenants were adjusted as follows minimum fixed charge ratio to a minimum of  maximum lease adjusted total debt to ebitdar ratio up to to  minimum tangible net worth to million  and the minimum asset coverage ratio to be no less than to the restatement and the financial covenants included therein were in effect starting june   at which time we were in compliance with the restated covenants 
the credit agreement  as amended by the restatement  matures on january  the credit agreement is intended to provide for ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit agreement are based  at the option of the company  on a base rate equal to the g reater of the federal funds rate plus an applicable margin between and and the administrative agent s prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin between and that is adjusted quarterly based on cash flow coverage 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by celadon e commerce  inc  celadon canada  inc  and jaguar  each of which is a subsidiary of the company 

table of contents the credit agreement  as amended by the restatement  has a maximum revolving borrowing limit of million 
letters of credit are limited to an aggregate commitment of million and a swing line facility has a limit of million 
a commitment fee that is adjusted quarterly between and per annum based on cash flow coverage is due on the daily unused portion of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains certain restrictions and covenants relating to  among other things  dividends  tangible net worth  cash flow  mergers  consolidations  acquisitions and dispositions  and total indebtedness 
we were in compliance with these covenants at june   and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
 at june   we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and million was utilized for standby letters of credit 
contractual obligations and commitments as of june   our bank loans  capitalized leases  operating leases  other debts  and future commitments have stated maturities or minimum annual payments as follows cash requirements as of june  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases lease residual value guarantees capital lease obligations long term debt sub total future purchase of revenue equipment employment and consulting agreements standby letters of credit total contractual and cash obligations includes interest 
the amounts reflected in the table do not include amounts that could become payable to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  under certain circumstances if their employment by the company is terminated 
inflation  new emissions control regulations  and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and fuel prices 
new emissions control regulations and increases in commodity prices  wages of manufacturing workers  and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates  certain cost control efforts  and limiting the effects of fuel prices through fuel surcharges 

table of contents the engines used in our tractors are subject to emissions control regulations  which have substantially increased our operating expenses since additional and more stringent regulation began in as of june   the majority of our tractor fleet has engines compliant with stricter regulations regarding emissions that became effective in compliance with such regulations is expected to increase the cost of new tractors and could impair equipment productivity  lower fuel mileage  and increase our operating expenses 
these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operatio ns as the regulations impact our business through new tractor purchases 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel  as well as hedging activities  surcharge collection  the percentage of freight we obtain through brokers  and the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments may increase our costs of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
we impose fuel surcharges on substantially all accounts 
these arrangements may not fully protect us from fuel price increases and also may result in us not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases 
at june   we did not have any fuel hedging contracts in place 
if we do hedge  we may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements 
based on current market conditions  we have decided to limit our hedging and purchase commitments  but we continue to evaluate such measures 
the absence of meaningful fuel price protection through these measures could adversely affect our profitability 
recent events on august   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program pursuant to which the company is authorized to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
we are currently seeking the consent of our bank group to repurchase shares under the program 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts  and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following depreciation of property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally use estimated useful lives of to years for new tractors and trailers  and estimated salvage values for new tractors and trailers generally range from to of the capitalized cost 
gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in our statements of operations 
we review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect on our results of operations 
revenue equipment and other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred 
if the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long lived asset  then an impairment loss is recognized 
we measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised or estimated market value of the asset  as appropriate 

table of contents operating leases 
we have financed a substantial percentage of our tractors and trailers with operating leases 
these leases generally contain residual value guarantees  which provide that the value of equipment returned to the lessor at the end of the lease term will be no lower than a negotiated amount 
to the extent that the value of the equipment is below the negotiated amount  we are liable to the lessor for the shortage at the expiration of the lease 
for all equipment  we are required to recognize additional rental expense to the extent we believe the fair market value at the lease termination will be less than our obligation to the lessor 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  accounting for leases  property and equipment held under operating leases  and liabilities related thereto  are not reflected on our balance sheet 
all expenses related to revenue equipment operating leases are reflected on our statements of operations in the line item entitled revenue equipment rentals 
as such  financing revenue equipment with operating leases instead of bank borrowings or capital leases effectively moves the interest component of the financing arrangement into operating expenses on our statements of operations 
claims reserves and estimates 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of these self insurance amounts 
claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated uninsured portion of reported claims  including adverse development of reported claims  as well as estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
reported claims and related loss reserves are estimated by third party administrators  and we refer to these estimates in establishing our reserves 
cla ims incurred but not reported are estimated based on our historical experience and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves we must take into account and estimate various factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions concerning the nature and severity of the claim  the effect of the jurisdiction on any award or settlement  the length of time until ultimate resolution  inflation rates in health care  and in general interest rates  legal expenses  and other factors 
our actual experience may be different than our estimates  sometimes significantly 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
insurance and claims expense will vary from period to period based on the severity and frequency of claims incurred in a given period 
derivative instruments and hedging activity 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments related to currency exchange rates include forward purchase and sale agreements which generally have terms no greater than months 
to account for our derivative financial instruments  we follow the provisions of asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item 
these activities have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented herein 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with asc topic income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate our tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis and adjust these balances as appropriate 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
however  should our tax positions be challenged and not prevail  different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the carrying value of our deferred tax assets tax benefits expected to be realized in the future assumes that we will be able to generate  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our forecasts of future income 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a periodic basis and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
federal income taxes are provided on that portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk principally from our primary credit facility 
the credit facility carries a maximum variable interest rate of either the bank s base rate or libor plus 
at june   we did not have any variable rate term loan borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
a hypothetical increase in the bank s base rate and libor would be immaterial to our net income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  specifically in connection with our canadian operations 
while virtually all of the expenses associated with our canadian operations  such as independent contractor costs  company driver compensation  and administrative costs  are paid in canadian dollars  a significant portion of our revenue generated from those operations is billed in us dollars because many of our customers are us shippers transporting goods to or from canada 
as a result  increases in the canadian dollar exchange rate adversely affect the profitability of our canadian operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our canadian operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currenc y mix  we estimate that a increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by approximately  we currently have contracts for million canadian dollars over the next year  representing approximately of our canadian currency exposure 
we generally do not face the same magnitude of foreign currency exchange rate risk in connection with our intra mexico operations conducted through our mexican subsidiary  jaguar  because our foreign currency revenues are generally proportionate to our foreign currency expenses for those operations 
for purposes of consolidation  however  the operating results earned by our subsidiaries  including jaguar  in foreign currencies are converted into united states dollars 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the mexican peso could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our mexican operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a decrease in the mexican peso exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by appr oximately  we currently have contracts for million mexican pesos per month over the next year  representing approximately of our mexican currency exposure 
derivative gains losses  initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income  are reclassified to earnings in the period when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
commodity price risk 
shortages of fuel  increases in prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
fuel is subject to economic  political  and market factors that are outside of our control 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through the collection of fuel surcharges 
however  fuel surcharges do not always fully offset increases in fuel prices 
in addition  from time to time we may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
as of june   we had none of our estimated fuel purchases hedged
