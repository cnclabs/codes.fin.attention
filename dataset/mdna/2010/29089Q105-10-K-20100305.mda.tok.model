item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors sections of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
overview product portfolio we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development  manufacture and commercialization of vaccines and antibody therapies that assist the body s immune system to prevent or treat disease 
for financial reporting purposes  we operate in two business segments  biodefense and commercial 
our biodefense segment focuses on vaccines and antibody therapies for use against biological agents that are potential weapons of bioterrorism or biowarfare 
our product candidates in this segment are focused on anthrax 
we manufacture and market biothrax anthrax vaccine adsorbed  the only vaccine licensed by the us food and drug administration  or fda  for the prevention of anthrax infection 
in addition to biothrax  we are developing a recombinant protective antigen  or rpa  anthrax vaccine  an anthrax immune globulin therapeutic  an anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic  a biothrax dual adjuvant vaccine  and an advanced double mutant protective antigen anthrax vaccine 
our commercial segment focuses on vaccines and antibody therapies for use against infectious diseases and other medical conditions that have resulted in significant unmet or underserved public health needs 
our product candidates in this segment include a tuberculosis vaccine  a typhoid vaccine  an influenza vaccine and a chlamydia vaccine 
our biodefense segment has generated net income for each of the last five fiscal years 
our commercial segment has generated revenue through development contracts and grant funding 
none of our commercial product candidates has received marketing approval and  therefore  our commercial segment has not generated any product sales revenues 
as a result  our commercial segment has incurred a net loss for each of the last five fiscal years 
product sales we have derived substantially all of our product sales revenues from biothrax sales to the us department of health and human services  or hhs  and the us department of defense  or dod  and expect for the foreseeable future to continue to derive substantially all of our product sales revenues from the sales of biothrax to the us government 
our total revenues from biothrax sales were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
we are focused on increasing sales of biothrax to us government customers  expanding the market for biothrax to other customers domestically and internationally and pursuing label expansions and improvements for biothrax 
contracts and grants we seek to advance development of our product candidates through external funding arrangements 
we may slow down development programs or place them on hold during periods that are not covered by external funding 
we have received external funding awards for the following development programs biothrax post exposure prophylaxis biothrax dual adjuvant vaccine anthrax immune globulin therapeutic anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic advanced double mutant protective antigen recombinant botulinum vaccine typhella typhoid vaccine live oral zh additionally  our tuberculosis vaccine product candidate is indirectly supported by grant funding provided to the university of oxford by the wellcome trust and aeras global tuberculosis vaccine foundation 
we continue to actively pursue additional government sponsored development contracts and grants and to encourage both governmental and non governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations to provide development funding or to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates 
manufacturing infrastructure we conduct our primary vaccine manufacturing operations at a multi building campus on approximately acres in lansing  michigan 
to augment our existing manufacturing capabilities  we have constructed a  square foot manufacturing facility on our lansing campus 
we have incurred costs of approximately million through december for the building and associated capital equipment  as well as for validation and qualification activities required for regulatory approval and initiation of manufacturing 
we suspended the completion of those activities for approximately one year as we commenced a change over process to plan for the potential use of the facility for the manufacture of our rpa anthrax vaccine product candidate under an anticipated hhs contract for the development of a recombinant anthrax vaccine 
this change over process was successfully completed 
during the fourth quarter of  we recommenced qualification and validation activities for the commercial manufacture of biothrax 
we designed this facility to be campaignable subject to complying with appropriate change over procedures  and we may seek permission from the fda to use the facility for the manufacture of both biothrax and our rpa anthrax vaccine product candidate 
in the event we do not manufacture our rpa anthrax vaccine product candidate in this building  we intend to use the facility for the manufacture of biothrax and potentially for additional products 
in november  we paid approximately million to purchase a building in baltimore  maryland for product development and manufacturing purposes  and have begun renovation and improvement of this facility 
our specific plans for this facility will be contingent on the progress of our existing development programs and the outcome of our efforts to acquire new product candidates 
as we proceed with this project  we expect the costs to be substantial and will likely seek external sources of funds to finance the project 
in october  we paid approximately million to purchase the product development facility in gaithersburg  maryland that we previously leased 
we are in the process of developing plans and cost estimates for renovations and improvements to the facility 
these plans will be contingent on the progress of our existing development programs 
we also own two buildings in frederick  maryland that we currently expect to sell 
accordingly  we have classified these buildings as held for sale in our balance sheet  and recorded an impairment expense of approximately million in related to costs previously capitalized  based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value less costs to sell 
we continue to actively seek to sell these buildings 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair value of stock based compensation and income taxes 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from product sales that require no continuing performance on our part if four basic criteria have been met there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or title has passed to our customer based on contract terms  the fee is fixed and determinable and no further obligation exists  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have generated biothrax sales revenues under us government contracts with hhs and the dod 
under our current contract with hhs  we invoice hhs and recognize the related revenues upon acceptance by the government at the delivery site  at which time title to the product passes to hhs 
from time to time  we are awarded reimbursement contracts for services and development grant contracts with government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations 
under these contracts  we typically are reimbursed for our costs as we perform specific development activities  and we may also be entitled to additional fees 
we recognize revenue upon incurring accepted reimbursable costs 
the amounts that we receive under these contracts vary greatly from quarter to quarter  depending on the scope and nature of the work performed 
we record the reimbursement of our costs and any associated fees as contracts and grants revenue and the associated costs as research and development expense 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at invoice amounts and consist primarily of amounts due from hhs as well as amounts due under reimbursement contracts with other government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations 
because the collection history for receivables from these entities indicate that collection is likely  we do not currently record an allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using a standard cost method  which approximates average cost 
average cost consists primarily of material  labor and manufacturing overhead expenses and includes the services and products of third party suppliers 
we analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down in the applicable period inventory that has become obsolete  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected customer demand 
we also write off in the applicable period the costs related to expired inventory 
we capitalize the costs associated with the manufacture of biothrax as inventory from the initiation of the manufacturing process through the completion of manufacturing  labeling and packaging 
income taxes under the asset and liability method of income tax accounting  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a net deferred tax asset or liability is reported on the balance sheet 
our deferred tax assets include the unamortized portion of in process research and development expenses  the anticipated future benefit of the net operating losses that we have incurred and other timing differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we have historically incurred net operating losses for income tax purposes in some states  primarily maryland  and in some foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom 
the amount of the deferred tax assets on our balance sheet reflects our expectations regarding our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income 
the applicable tax rules in particular jurisdictions limit our ability to use net operating losses as a result of ownership changes 
in particular  we believe that these rules will significantly limit our ability to use net operating losses generated by microscience limited  or microscience  and antex biologics  inc  or antex  prior to our acquisition of microscience in june and our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of antex in may we review our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess our ability to realize the benefit from these deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that the amount of our expected future taxable income will not be sufficient to allow us to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  we increase our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by recording a provision for income taxes on our income statement  which reduces net income or increases net loss for that period and reduces our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
if we determine that the amount of our expected future taxable income will allow us to utilize net operating losses in excess of our net deferred tax assets  we reduce our valuation allowance by recording a benefit from income taxes on our income statement  which increases net income or reduces net loss for that period and increases our deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
uncertainty in income taxes is accounted for using a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
stock based compensation in accordance with stock based compensation accounting guidance  all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  are recognized in the income statement based on their estimated grant date fair values 
we value our share based payment transactions using the black scholes valuation model 
we measure the amount of compensation cost based on the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of grant 
we recognize compensation cost over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
the effect of this accounting treatment on net income attributable to emergent biosolutions inc and earnings per share in any period is not necessarily representative of the effects in future years due to  among other things  the vesting period of the stock options and the fair value of additional stock option grants in future years 
financial operations overview revenues on september   we entered into an agreement with hhs to supply million doses of biothrax to hhs for placement into the strategic national stockpile  or the sns 
the term of the agreement is from september  through september  the firm fixed price for the million doses  net of a discount for a portion of the doses  is million in the aggregate 
in june  we received fda approval of our supplement to our biologics license application  or bla  to extend the expiry dating of biothrax from three years to four years 
as a result of this approval  hhs agreed to increase the price per dose under the agreement by eliminating the discount for the final million doses sold  up to a total of approximately million 
in conjunction with this approval  we billed hhs approximately million for doses delivered through july  under this agreement  we provided all shipping services related to delivery of doses into the sns over the term of the agreement  for which hhs paid us approximately million 
we invoiced hhs for each delivery upon acceptance of biothrax doses delivered into the sns 
in july  we completed delivery of the doses under this agreement 
the agreement also provided for hhs to pay us up to million in milestone payments in connection with us advancing a program to obtain a post exposure prophylaxis indication for biothrax 
these funds are payable upon achievement of specific program milestones 
in october  we achieved the initial milestone and received payment from hhs of million 
on september   we entered into an agreement with hhs to supply up to million doses of biothrax to hhs for placement into the sns 
the term of the agreement is from september  through september  delivery of doses under the agreement commenced in september and will continue through september funds for the procurement of the first million doses of biothrax have been committed 
procurement of the remaining million doses will be funded through the annual appropriations process for the sns 
four year expiry dated product will be invoiced at a higher price than three year expiry dated product 
the total purchase price for the million doses will be up to approximately million  assuming the delivery of four year expiry dated product 
through december   we have delivered approximately million doses under this agreement 
we have agreed to provide all shipping services related to delivery of doses into the sns over the term of the agreement  for which hhs has agreed to pay us approximately million 
we invoice hhs under the agreement upon acceptance of each delivery of biothrax doses to the sns 
we have received contract and grant funding from niaid and barda for the following development programs product candidate funding source award date amount up to performance period anthrax immune globulin therapeutic niaid september million recombinant botulinum vaccine niaid june million biothrax dual adjuvant vaccine niaid july million anthrax monoclonal antibody therapeutic niaid barda september million biothrax dual adjuvant vaccine niaid barda september million double mutant protective antigen anthrax vaccine niaid september million our revenue  operating results and profitability have varied  and we expect that they will continue to vary on a quarterly basis  primarily because of the timing of our fulfilling orders for biothrax and work done under new and existing contracts and grants 
cost of product sales the primary expense that we incur to deliver biothrax to our customers is manufacturing costs  which are primarily fixed costs 
these fixed manufacturing costs consist of facilities  utilities and salaries and personnel related expenses for indirect manufacturing support staff 
variable manufacturing costs for biothrax consist primarily of costs for materials  direct labor and contract filling operations 
we determine the cost of product sales for doses sold during a reporting period based on the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period those doses were manufactured 
we calculate the average manufacturing cost per dose in the period of manufacture by dividing the actual costs of manufacturing in such period by the number of units produced in that period 
in addition to the fixed and variable manufacturing costs described above  the average manufacturing cost per dose depends on the efficiency of the manufacturing process  utilization of available manufacturing capacity and the production yield for the period of production 
research and development expenses we expense research and development costs as incurred 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees to professional service providers for  among other things  preclinical and analytical testing  independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data from our clinical trials and non clinical studies  costs of contract manufacturing services for clinical trial material  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  depreciation of capital assets used to develop our products  and operating costs  such as the operating costs of facilities and the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates 
we expect that development spending for our product pipeline will increase as our product development activities continue based on ongoing advancement of our product candidates  and as we prepare for regulatory submissions and other regulatory activities 
we expect that the magnitude of any increase in our research and development spending will be dependent upon such factors as the results from our ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials  the size  structure and duration of any follow on clinical programs that we may initiate  costs associated with manufacturing our product candidates on a large scale basis for later stage clinical trials  and our ability to use or rely on data generated by government agencies  such as studies with biothrax conducted by the centers for disease control and prevention  or cdc 
in july  we entered into a joint venture with the university of oxford  or oxford  and certain oxford researchers to conduct clinical trials in the advancement of a vaccine product candidate for tuberculosis  resulting in the formation of the oxford emergent tuberculosis consortium  or oetc 
we have a equity interest in oetc and control the oetc board of directors 
in addition  we have certain funding and service obligations of up to approximately million related to our investment through to support further development of the vaccine product candidate and a phase iib proof of concept study in humans  primarily in the form of services to be performed by our personnel on behalf of the joint venture 
as part of this arrangement  we have entered into a license agreement with the joint venture pursuant to which we obtained rights to develop  manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical compositions intended to prevent or treat tuberculosis in humans in developed countries 
oxford s contributions include support from the wellcome trust and the aeras global tuberculosis vaccine foundation for the phase iib clinical trial in the form of cash and services 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  sales and marketing  business development  finance  accounting  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in cost of product sales or research and development expense and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
we currently market and sell biothrax directly to hhs with a small  targeted marketing and sales group 
as we seek to broaden the market for biothrax and if we receive marketing approval for additional products  we expect that we will increase our spending for marketing and sales activities 
total other income expense total other income expense consists primarily of interest income and interest expense 
we earn interest income on our cash  cash equivalents and a note receivable  and we incur interest expense on our indebtedness 
we capitalize interest based on the cost of major ongoing projects which have not yet been placed in service  such as new manufacturing facilities 
some of our existing debt arrangements provide for increasing amortization of principal payments in future periods 
see liquidity and capital resources debt financing for additional information 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december revenues product sales revenues increased by million  or  to million for from million for this increase in product sales revenues was primarily due to payments from hhs of approximately million related to the approval of four year expiry dating for biothrax  obtained in june  coupled with an increase in the number of doses sold in product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million and aggregate international and other sales of  product sales revenues in consisted of biothrax sales to hhs of million and aggregate international and other sales of million

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december payments due by period in thousands total after contractual obligations long term indebtedness operating lease obligations contractual settlement liabilities total contractual obligations there are a number of uncertainties that we face in the development of new product candidates that prevent us from making a reasonable estimate of the cash obligations under our material license and collaboration agreements 
because of these uncertainties  the preceding table excludes contingent contractual payments that we may become obligated to make under such agreements 
these agreements typically provide for the payment of milestone fees upon achievement of specified research  development and commercialization milestones  such as the commencement of clinical trials  the receipt of funding awards  the receipt of regulatory approvals  and the achievement of sales milestones 
the amount of contingent contractual milestone payments that we may become obligated to make is variable based on the actual achievement and timing of the applicable milestones and the characteristics of any products or product candidates that are developed  including factors such as number of products or product candidates developed  type and number of components of each product or product candidate  ownership of the various components and the specific markets affected  and the aggregate payments could be as much as approximately million 
the success of our efforts to commercialize our product candidates depends on many factors  including those set forth in risk factors our business depends significantly on our success in completing development and commercialization of our product candidates at acceptable costs  and is highly uncertain 
even if these efforts are successful  the timing of success is highly unpredictable and variable 
the same is true for any contingent contractual royalty payments that we may be obligated to make upon successful commercialization of these product candidates 
we do not expect that any such payments would have an adverse effect on our financial position  operations and capital resources because  if payable  we expect that the benefits associated with the achievement of the relevant milestones or the achievement of revenue would offset the burden of making these payments 
we are not obligated to pay any minimum royalties under our existing contracts 
debt financing as of december   we had million principal amount of debt outstanding  comprised primarily of the following million outstanding under a loan from the department of business and economic development of the state of maryland used to finance eligible costs incurred to purchase our first facility in frederick  maryland  million outstanding under a mortgage loan from pnc bank used to finance the remaining portion of the purchase price for our first frederick facility  million outstanding under a mortgage loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance the purchase price for our second facility on the frederick site  million outstanding under a term loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance a portion of the costs of our facility expansion in lansing  michigan  million outstanding under a mortgage loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance the purchase of our facility in baltimore  maryland  l million outstanding under a mortgage loan from hsbc realty credit corporation used to finance the purchase of our facility in gaithersburg  maryland  and million outstanding under a million revolving line of credit with fifth third bank  the balance of which we repaid in january some of our debt instruments contain financial and operating covenants

our line of credit with fifth third bank is secured by accounts receivable under our hhs and dod contracts 
our term loan with hsbc realty credit corporation is secured by substantially all of emergent biodefense operations assets  other than accounts receivable under our hhs and dod contracts

consistent with the terms of this agreement  we repaid million of outstanding principal under the line of credit in january interest is payable monthly and accrues at an annual rate equal to less than the prime rate of interest established from time to time by fifth third bank 
tax benefits in connection with our facility expansion in lansing  the state of michigan and the city of lansing have provided us a variety of tax credits and abatements 
we estimate that the total value of these tax benefits may be up to million over a period of up to years  beginning in these tax benefits are primarily based on our investment in our lansing facility 
in addition  we must maintain a specified number of employees in lansing to continue to qualify for these tax benefits 
funding requirements we expect to continue to fund our anticipated operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service requirements from existing cash and cash equivalents  revenues from biothrax product sales and other committed sources of funding 
there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with biothrax product sales and with the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we may seek additional external debt financing to provide additional financial flexibility 
our committed external sources of funds consist of the borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit with fifth third bank and grant and development funding of some of our product candidates 
our ability to borrow additional amounts under our loan agreement is subject to our satisfaction of specified conditions 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the level and timing of biothrax product sales and cost of product sales  the acquisition of  and capital improvements to new facilities  the timing of  and the costs involved in  completion of qualification and validation activities related to our manufacturing facility in lansing  michigan and  any new facilities  the scope  progress  results and costs of our preclinical and clinical development activities  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates  the number of  and development requirements for  other product candidates that we may pursue  the costs of commercialization activities  including product marketing  sales and distribution  the extent to which we lend money to third parties  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other patent related costs  including litigation costs and the results of such litigation  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies  our ability to obtain development funding from government entities and non government and philanthropic organizations  and our ability to establish and maintain collaborations 
we may require additional sources of funds for future acquisitions that we may make or  depending on the size of the obligation  to meet balloon payments upon maturity of our current borrowings 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet our future capital requirements  we will need to finance our cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements 
additional equity or debt financing  grants  or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs or reduce our planned commercialization efforts 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends 
any debt financing or additional equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences that are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash that have maturities of less than three months  and our long term indebtedness 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure or interest on foreign currency exchange exposure  and the movement of foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse or positive impact on our results of operations 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a significant impact on the realized value of our investments  but would likely increase the interest expense associated with our debt
