the decrease in total revenues is primarily due to the global economic environment that has resulted in reduced capital spending in the healthcare industry 
the impact has been felt more acutely in our aesthetics business which is largely driven by discretionary spending 
we did see an impact on our domestic ophthalmology business on the capital side at the beginning of the year as our customers became very cautious with capital spending although there were signs of a recovery towards the end of the year  and we believe that the number of domestic ophthalmology procedures that use our consumable probe fell during the year

table of contents income taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of thousand and an effective tax rate of for the year ended january  compared to a provision for income taxes of thousand for the year ended december  the increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in taxable income in the us liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing or to raise capital 
as of january   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million compared with cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million as of january  net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared with million being used in operating activities in in  the net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from the net income generated during and a reduction in inventories

as of january  all amounts owed to ams have been repaid 
the company has an asset based revolving line of credit facility with wells fargo bank 
the amount outstanding under the credit facility as of january  was million 
on march   the company repaid in full all amounts outstanding under its loan agreement with wells fargo bank and terminated the credit facility 
management is of the opinion that the company s current cash and cash equivalents together with our ability to generate cash flows from operations provide sufficient liquidity to operate for the next months 
contractual payment obligations our contractual payment obligations that were fixed and determinable as of january  were as follows payments due by period total and thereafter balance on revolving credit facility operating leases payments total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience  our knowledge of economic and market factors and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenues arise from the sale of laser consoles  delivery devices  consumables and service and support activities 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon receipt of a purchase order and product shipment provided that no significant obligations remain and collection of the receivables is reasonably assured 
shipments are generally made with free on board fob shipping point terms  whereby title passes upon shipment from our dock 
any shipments with fob receiving point terms are recorded as revenue when the shipment arrives at the receiving point 
cost is recognized as product sales revenue is recognized 
the company s sales may include post sales obligations for training or other deliverables 
for revenue arrangements such as these  we recognize revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements section of subtopic asc when the company has objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  it defers revenue attributable to the post sale obligations and recognizes such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise  the company defers all revenue related to the transaction until all elements are delivered 
revenue relating to extended warranty contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable warranty contract 
we recognize repair service revenue upon completion of the work 

table of contents inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and include on hand inventory physically held at the company s facility  sales demo inventory and service loaner inventory 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out fifo method 
lower of cost or market is evaluated by considering obsolescence  excessive levels of inventory  deterioration and other factors 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  obsolescence or impaired inventory and are charged to cost of revenues 
factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration and quality issues 
revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates 
sales returns allowance and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company estimates future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
significant management judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our provision for sales returns is recorded net of the associated costs 
the balance for the provision of sales returns  which is recorded to a deferred revenue account  was thousand and thousand as of january  and january   respectively 
similarly management must make estimates regarding the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non payment by customers to the extent of amounts recorded on the balance sheet 
as of january   we had accounts receivable totaling million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
as sales levels increase the level of accounts receivable would likely also increase 
in addition  in the event that customers were to delay their payments to us  the levels of accounts receivable would likely also increase 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on past payment history with the customer  analysis of the customer s current financial condition  the aging of the accounts receivable balance  customer concentration and other known factors 
warranty 
the company accrues for estimated warranty costs upon shipment of products 
actual warranty costs incurred have not materially differed from those accrued 
the company s warranty policy is applicable to products which are considered defective in their performance or fail to meet the product specifications 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of revenues 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
under asc  the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
in and  we have recorded a full valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets based on our past losses and uncertainty regarding our ability to project future taxable income 
in future periods if we are able to generate income we may reduce or eliminate the valuation allowance 

table of contents accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
in december  the company adopted financial accounting standards interpretation  or fin no 
asc  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
as codified in asc topic  income taxes asc 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return  and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
asc utilizes a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions 
step one  recognition  requires a company to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
step two  measurement  is based on the largest amount of benefit  which is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect of adopting asc on december  is recognized as a change in accounting principle  recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the adoption date 
as a result of the implementation of asc  the company recognized no change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to tax positions taken in prior periods 
upon adoption of asc  the company s policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the company s provision for benefit from income taxes did not change 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we record compensation costs of share based awards  options and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan in accordance with asc  stock compensation formerly referred to as sfas no 
r 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the years ended january   january   and december   included stock based compensation expense for share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc in conjunction with the adoption of asc  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation expense from the accelerated multiple option method to the straight line single option method 
stock based compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to january  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach  while stock based compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to december  will be recognized using the straight line single option method 
asc requires that we recognize expense for awards ultimately expected to vest  therefore we are required to develop an estimate of the number of awards expected to cancel prior to vesting forfeiture rate 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical pre vest cancellation experience and is applied to all share based awards 
asc requires the forfeiture rate to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
prior to fiscal year  we accounted for forfeitures as they actually occurred 
upon adoption of asc  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options and espp shares 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of share based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
for restricted stock or restricted stock units  stock based compensation expense is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we transact the majority of our business in us dollars and therefore changes in foreign currency rates will not have a significant impact on our income statement or cash flows 
however  increases in the value of the us dollar against any local currencies could cause our products to become relatively more expensive to customers in a particular country or region  leading to reduced revenue or profitability in that country or region 
as we continue to expand our international sales  our non us dollar denominated revenue and our exposure to gains and losses on international currency transactions may increase 
our french subsidiary does transact business in its local geography in euros 
we currently do not engage in transactions to hedge against the risk of the currency fluctuation  but we may do so in the future
