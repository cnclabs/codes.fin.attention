critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgment that is often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition our revenue is principally derived from fees for services generated on a project by project basis in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue asc 
revenue for services rendered is recognized on a time and materials basis or on a fixed fee or capped fee basis 
revenue for time and materials contracts is recognized based on the number of hours worked by our consultants at an agreed upon rate per hour and is recognized in the period in which services are performed 
revenue related to fixed fee or capped fee contracts is recognized on the proportional performance method of accounting based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to estimated total labor hours 
this percentage is multiplied by the contracted dollar amount of the project to determine the amount of revenue to recognize in an accounting period 
the contracted dollar amount used in this calculation excludes the amount the client pays us for reimbursable expenses 
there are situations where the number of hours to complete projects may exceed our original estimate 
these increases can be as a result of an increase in project scope  unforeseen events that arise  or the inability of the client or the delivery team to fulfill their responsibilities 
on an on going basis  our project delivery  office of risk management and finance personnel review hours incurred and estimated total labor hours to complete projects 
any revisions in these estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known 
if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss provision will be recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenue that will be generated by the contract and are included in total cost of service 
revenue for contracts with multiple elements is allocated based on the fair value of the elements and is recognized in accordance with our accounting policies for each element 

table of contents additionally  we earn revenue from the sale of software  software licenses and maintenance contracts  which is recognized in accordance with fasb asc topic  software 
revenue for the sale of software and software licenses is recognized upon contract execution and customer receipt of software 
revenue from maintenance contracts and advisory services is recognized ratably over the life of the agreements 
unbilled revenue represents revenue for services performed that have not been invoiced 
if we do not accurately estimate the scope of the work to be performed  or we do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time  or we do not meet our clients expectations under the contracts  then future consulting margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
revenue before reimbursements excludes reimbursable expenses charged to clients 
reimbursements  which include travel and out of pocket expenses  are included in revenue  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of service 
the agreements entered into in connection with a project  whether time and materials based or fixed fee or capped fee based  typically allow our clients to terminate early due to breach or for convenience with days notice 
in the event of termination  the client is contractually required to pay for all time  materials and expenses incurred by us through the effective date of the termination 
in addition  from time to time we enter into agreements with our clients that limit our right to enter into business relationships with specific competitors of that client for a specific time period 
these provisions typically prohibit us from performing a defined range of services which we might otherwise be willing to perform for potential clients 
these provisions are generally limited to six to twelve months and usually apply only to specific employees or the specific project team 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our clients not making required payments 
periodically  we review accounts receivable to assess our estimates of collectibility 
management critically reviews accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  past due accounts  client credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and long lived identifiable assets we assess goodwill and long lived identifiable assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or  at a minimum  on an annual basis 
we have made determinations as to what our reporting units are and what amounts of goodwill and intangible assets should be allocated to those reporting units 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and long lived identifiable assets  management makes assumptions regarding various factors to determine if impairment tests are met 
these estimates contain management s judgment  using appropriate and customary assumptions available at the time 
restructuring reserves restructuring reserves reflect judgments and estimates of our ultimate costs of severance  closure and consolidation of facilities and settlement of contractual obligations under our operating leases  including sublease rental rates  absorption period to sublease space and other related costs 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period 
if these estimates change in the future or actual results differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional charges in the future 
income taxes we record income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  we record deferred taxes based on temporary taxable and deductible differences between the tax bases of our assets and liabilities and our financial reporting bases 
the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes requires a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
effective december   we adopted fasb asc topic  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes asc 
asc prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures 
we report the penalties and tax related interest expense as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents contingent liabilities we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made  and that such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
reserves for contingent liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements based on management s assessment  along with legal counsel  of the expected outcome of the contingencies 
if the final outcome of our contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in income or a charge to earnings when determined 
the foregoing list was not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for us to judge the application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
