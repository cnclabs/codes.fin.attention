kapstone believes our critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
sales with terms designated fob free on board shipping point are recognized at the time of shipment 
for sales transactions with terms fob destination  revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer s site and when title and risk of loss are transferred 
sales on consignment are recognized in revenue at the earlier of the month that the goods are consumed or after a period of time subsequent to receipt by the customer as specified by contract terms 
incentive rebates are typically paid in cash and are netted against revenue on an accrual basis as qualifying purchases are made by the customer to earn and thereby retain the rebate 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of shaft horsepower  generated by our cogeneration facility  on a gross basis and within net sales 
these sales are included in the unbleached kraft segment

goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired 
on an annual basis and in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  the company tests for goodwill impairment using a two step process  unless there is a triggering event  in which case a test would be performed at the time that such triggering event occurs 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
for all periods presented  the company s reporting units are consistent with its operating segments 
the estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined based on a market approach as well as an income approach using a discounted cash flow analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires the company to make various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the forecast and long term business plans of the company s operating segment 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting units 
if necessary  the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
pension and postretirement benefits kapstone provides pension and postretirement benefits to certain employees 
for financial reporting purposes  long term assumptions are developed through consultations with actuaries 
such assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates  health care trend rates and mortality rates 
the discount rate for the current year is based on long term high quality bond rates 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method in accordance with asc  income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income taxes are provided for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized
