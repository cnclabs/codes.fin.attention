item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with  and are qualified by reference to  our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item of this report and selected financial data included in item of this report 
certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform of refer to the cautionary statement about forward looking statements preceding item of this report 
also  for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see risk factors in item a of this report 
we were founded in as a cleaner coal technology  energy production and environmental solutions company focused on developing our proprietary technologies 
in the last two years  we have sharpened our focus as a carbon technology company 
we have developed two proprietary  patented  and potentially transformative green technologies the greencert suite of software and services and k fuel 
our greencert technology is a scientifically accurate and scalable environment intelligence solution that measures greenhouse gases or ghg and other environmental costs enabling customers to manage and report their environmental assets and liabilities 
greencert  built on ibm s service oriented architecture or soa  is the environment intelligence solution that provides customers the end to end visibility and traceability necessary to measure their complete environmental footprint 
k fuel  our clean coal technology significantly improves the performance of low rank coals yielding higher efficiency and lower emissions 
we are continuing the development of our greencert suite of software and services 
greencert is an accurate and scalable environmental intelligence solution that quantifies ghg emission avoidances and reductions and generates verifiable emissions offsets 
greencert provides real time  multiple method data analysis to increase accuracy and reduce uncertainty to quantify incremental improvements 
greencert also enables enterprises to reduce overall costs via the identification of significant operational efficiencies  compliance and risk reduction and sustainability measures 
we intend to sell greencert as an on premise offering and as a hosted software as a service saas solution  both with annual licensing fees and renewal fees 
over the past year  we have been evaluating several alternatives related to our strategic positioning  including the potential sale of buckeye 
as further described in item business  on march   we signed a definitive agreement with rosebud mining company with respect to the sale of certain net assets of buckeye for million  in addition to the the release of million of cash reclamation bonds 
further  million of the purchase price will be deposited into escrow for a period of twelve months to cover amounts payable to rosebud pursuant to the indemnification provision of the sales agreement 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and the completion of rosebud s due diligence 
the sale is expected to close in april  but in any event no later than june  the proceeds from the sale of buckeye will be used to retire the outstanding notes including fees and accrued interest of million  to fund related transaction expenses estimated at million and for general working capital purposes 
we recorded an impairment charge of million to write down these assets to their fair market value 
with the sale of buckeye we will be able to better focus our resources on core business activities  including the k fuel technology 
we have terminated the contemplated spin off of the k fuel technology as previously announced 
concurrently  evergreen china signed a letter of intent with a large chinese integrated utility and chemical manufacturer to build a k fuel plant in inner mongolia to produce k fuel refined coal from low ranked lignite feedstock 
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly and majority owned subsidiaries 
we consolidate all of our majority owned subsidiaries and reflect as 
table of contents minority interest the portion of these entities that we do not own and recorded in other long term liabilities 
we do not consolidate our chinese joint venture  evergreen china  but record the activity using the equity method of investment 
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
our segments include the greencert segment  plant segment  mining segment and technology segment 
the greencert segment reflects activities related to the measurement of green house gases and certification of environmental improvements as carbon credits 
the plant segment primarily represents revenue and costs related to our fort union plant near gillette  wyoming  at which we suspended operations in march the mining segment primarily represents our mining operations of our subsidiary  buckeye  and includes certain marketing personnel  the ash disposal facility and the preparation and blending facility 
the technology segment is comprised of all other operations that use  apply  own or otherwise advance our proprietary patented k fuel process  including our headquarters and related operations  activities of evergreen energy asia pacific corp 
and kfx technology  llc  which holds the patents to our technology 
corporate costs within our technology segment are allocated to our other segments  generally on a percentage based on the number of employees  total segment operating expenses  or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures 
significant trends for the last several years  our operations have been focused on developing our two technologies greencert and k fuel and the construction of the fort union plant 
to date  we have not yet generated significant revenues from either of these technologies 
historically most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses 
with the addition of buckeye  we have begun to generate revenue and incur more substantial mining costs 
as previously discussed  we have entered into an agreement to sell certain of our mining segments assets and as a result  do not expect there to be any mining revenues and limited mining expenses after the completion of this sale 
in the future  we plan to identify potential future strategic partners for greencert  in addition to ibm  eim and black and veatch  to assist in the development  testing and roll out of our products 
potential partners include companies offering services or products such as energy engineering  consulting  power generation performance optimization  environmental consulting  and products relating to sensor systems and devices  data collection devices  or other products that support energy or power plant operations 
through our greencert software we plan to generate revenues through measurement of baseline emissions  assess and identify capital and operational improvements and site specific  highly customized solution that enables the quantification and monetization of the emissions reductions and efficiency improvements 
we plan to license our k fuel technology  focusing on the asia pacific region of the world through evergreen china 
the following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that we believe have or will have in the future the most significant impact on our business 
revenue trends in the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources revenues from licensing our greencert technology  revenues from renewal fees from our greencert technology  revenues from the measurement of carbon credits using our greencert technology  revenues from site specific efficiency improvements using our greencert technology  revenues from pilot projects using our greencert technology  revenues for supporting our greencert technology  and coal sales from our buckeye operations for the period during which we continue to own it  
table of contents revenues from k fuel licensing 
expense trends greencert as we develop and implement our greencert technology we will incur additional operational cost such as payroll and related burdens  outsourced professional fees associated with the development of greencert software  consulting costs for pilot deployment  and professional fees related to the deployment of site specific  highly customized solution for the quantification and monetization of emissions 
general and administrative expenses as we identify business development opportunities and generally expand our business  including hiring additional personnel at our corporate office  greencert locations and increasing outsourced professional services  we will incur additional expenses  the most significant of which are payroll and related burdens  non cash  share based compensation  sales and marketing costs for greencert technology  rent and utilities  and professional support fees 
we anticipate that accounting for non cash  share based compensation will add approximately million to million per year in the foreseeable future to our expenses 
in the event we should achieve certain stock price targets  we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs 
costs such as payroll and related burdens  professional support fees and utilities are variable costs that increase with size and adding locations 
as we develop our greencert and k fuel technologies we expect these costs to increase in future periods 
coal mining operatingeexpenses we incur mine operating expenses including all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility as a result of buckeye s operations 
as previously discussed  we have entered into an agreement to sell certain mining segment assets and as a result  do not expect there to be any revenues and limited mining expenses after the completion of this sale 
fort union in march  we suspended operations at our fort union plant in order to redirect constrained resources  both capital and human  to focus on the commercialization of this process in future k fuel plants 
suspending production at fort union enabled us to reduce our cash expenditures 
we will continue to incur various costs related to maintaining the site in a non operational mode 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period ended december  with the sale of buckeye  we anticipate our future mining revenues to decline 
revenues in our mining segment for the year ended december  were million and million for the same period ended december  respectively  as follows coal revenue includes mined raw and prepared coal sales within our buckeye operations 
buckeye coal sales  including transportation costs charged to customers  were million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coal sales for the year ended december  were  tons at sales realization per ton sold net of transportation costs of million compared to  tons at sales realization per tons sold  net of transportation cost of million for the year ended december  our coal price per ton increased due to our increase in our pre sold negotiated price per ton 
however  revenues decreased due to the depressed economy and the unusually mild summer temperatures in the north east region of the united states  both of which have led to lower than previously forecasted coal prices and reduced coal consumption 
however  sales realization for the year ended december  increased primarily due to higher coal prices realized during the first quarter of compared to the same period ended net brokered coal sales  include the revenues reduced by costs associated with the purchase of coal from other coal producers  which we ship directly to customers 
we recognized  of net revenue for the year ended december  compared to  of net revenue for the year ended december  we enter into brokered coal sales as opportunities arise or as needed to meet certain customers requests  and as a result  revenues in this area fluctuate 
ash disposal revenues primarily include revenues generated from the disposal of coal combustion bi products at our ash pit in ohio 
ash disposal revenues were million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  was due to decreased disposal volume from one of our large customers 
k fuel refined coal revenue is comprised of sales of our k fuel product to third parties 
blended k fuel refined coal revenue represents the proportionate revenue related to k fuel that has been blended with other raw or prepared coal from our buckeye operations and sold to third parties 
the remaining revenue related to the raw or prepared coal is reflected in mining revenues 
k fuel refined coal and blended k fuel refined coal sales were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively and are included in our plant segment 
coal mining operating expenses our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at buckeye  which principally comprises our mining segment 
coal mining operating expenses coal mining operating expenses include employee related costs  outside contracted mining costs for our underground mines  internal and external coal transportation costs  blasting  drilling  heavy equipment costs  purchased coal and other mining related costs 
coal mining operating expenses were 
table of contents million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coal mining operating expenses decreased for the year ended december  compared to however  costs per ton increased during this same period due to more than expected ash and rock content thus increasing transportation costs and preparation separation costs 
ash disposal ash disposal expenses include employee related costs  consulting costs  costs of repairs and maintaining culverts and drainage ponds  transportation  and heavy equipment costs and other costs associated with the ash disposal facility 
ash disposal expenses were million and million for the periods ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  is in correlation with the decrease in revenue for the same period 
general and administrative corporate costs within our technology segment are allocated to our other segments  generally on a percentage based on the number of employees  total segment operating expenses or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures 
as a result of idling our fort union plant  these allocated costs have significantly decreased in our plant segment and increased in other segments most notably in our technology and greencert segments  for the year ended when compared to the following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands employee related costs non cash  share based compensation professional fees office and travel costs insurance and other total general and administrative non cash  share based compensation expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  most of which related to our technology segment 
the decrease for the year ended was primarily due to the reduction of our workforce and the related forfeiture of the grants 
we also recognized a one time decrease due to the retirement of a former officer and the impact of his retirement on his restricted stock grant 
since the restricted shares never vested and were forfeited upon retirement  the cumulative non cash compensation expense recorded since was reversed 
this reversal of non cash compensation totaled million for the year ended december  the decreases were partially offset by a transition agreement we entered into with another former officer 
pursuant to that agreement  we accelerated the restricted stock grant and recorded million of non cash compensation for the year ended december  employee related costs primarily include salaries and wages  temporary employees  bonuses  benefits  employer payroll taxes and education and training 
the following table summarizes our 
table of contents employee related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands greencert technology mining plant total employee related the decrease for the year ended december  in comparison to the same period in was primarily due to our cost cutting measures which resulted in lower employee count in our technology and plant segments 
this decrease was offset by the addition of personnel to our greencert segment and severance expense for two former executive officers in the amount of  in our technology segment 
professional fees include legal  audit and accounting  public relations  governmental relations and similar costs 
the following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands greencert technology mining plant total professional fees the increase for the year ended december  compared the year ended was due to legal fees related to certain financing transactions that were not consummated  fees related to the marketing of buckeye and international work  all related to our technology segment  and filing patent applications for our greencert technology in our greencert segment 
office and travel costs include airfare  lodging  meals  office rent  marketing  office supplies  phone  publications  subscriptions and utilities 
the following table summarizes our office and travel costs related to each of our segments for years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands greencert technology mining plant total office and travel 
table of contents the increase in office and travel for the year ended december  is primarily due to a non recurring charge of million due to consolidating our employees into a smaller section of our office space to enable us to potentially sublease the remaining office space at our corporate location 
the majority of this non recurring charge was allocated to our greencert segment based on the number of employees  total segment operating expenses or segment operating expenses plus segment capital expenditures 
insurance and other costs primarily include costs related to our property and commercial liability  other insurance and all costs that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include  among other costs  various business and franchise taxes  licensing fees  repair and maintenance  engineering and technical services and director expenses 
the following table summarizes our insurance and other costs related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands greencert technology mining plant total insurance and other costs decreased for the year ended december  mainly due to the idling of our ft 
union plant in and the resulting decrease in engineering and technical services expense in our technology segment 
plant costs subsequent to the idling of the fort union plant  costs primarily consist of salaries and wages  security  utilities and repair and maintenance 
previously  plant costs included purchased raw materials  coal transportation  outsourced engineering and technical support  fluid processing  by products and water disposal  and employee related costs  which are reflected in our plant segment 
plant costs decreased during the year ended december  as compared to primarily due to the idling of our fort union plant in late march overall  while we anticipate costs to somewhat decline in  we will continue to incur various costs related to maintaining the site in a non operating mode 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization are principally comprised of i depletion  based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in ohio  ii amortization related to our patents  and iii depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight line method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period ended research and development research and development costs include costs incurred to advance  test  or otherwise modify our proprietary k fuel technology or develop new technologies and primarily include costs incurred to operate and maintain our laboratory facilities and professional engineering fees related to off site testing of our k fuel refined coal 
research and development costs were  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
as a result of cost cutting measures  we decreased the number of employees and the corresponding salary and wages at our lab at fort union 

table of contents asset impairment charges asset impairment charges were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of the impairment charge in relates to the write down of our buckeye assets 
other asset impairment charges for year ended december  relate to the impairment of our leasehold improvements of the vacated office space that we are attempting to sublease and is reflected in our technology segment 
asset impairment charges for the year ended december  relate to further impairment of our boiler island which was classified as assets held for sale 
see note property plant and equipment in item of this report for further details 
other income expense interest income interest income was  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december  was principally attributable to a lower cash balance in interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the interest expense relates to the notes and notes more fully described in note debt 
other income expense during the year ended december   other income was million as compared to  of other expense for the same period ended the increase in compared to primarily relates to the fair value adjustments of our embedded derivatives in the amount of million 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period ended december  revenues in our mining segment for the year ended december  were million and million for the same period ended december  respectively  as follows buckeye coal sales  including transportation costs charged to customers  were million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
coal sales for the year ended december  were  tons at sales realization per ton sold compared to  tons at sales realization per tons sold for the year ended december  the increase in the sales realization per ton sold for the year ended december  was due to higher coal prices when compared to the year ended december  our production tons for the year ended december   were less than anticipated due to power outages and other weather issues related to hurricane ike 
in addition  we experienced unexpected adverse roof conditions resulting from clay vein slip areas in a section of one of our underground mining veins 
we have resolved the roof conditions by using longer and more bolts in each of the main entries and narrowing the belt entry 
we were also required to obtain the mine safety and health administrations approval of the revised roof control and ventilation plans  which took longer than anticipated 
we recognized  of brokered coal sales net revenue for the year ended december  compared to  of net revenue for the year ended december  we enter into

table of contents the following table summarizes our employee related costs related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands greencert technology mining plant total employee related employee related costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases for the year ended december  in comparison to the same period in  were primarily due to adding personnel to our greencert segment  as well as adding engineering and other personnel in our technology segment  recruiting fees  an overall increase in health insurance costs and changes in the allocation of corporate costs to various segments 
the following table summarizes our professional fees related to each of our segments for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands greencert technology mining plant total professional fees the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to  was due to less outsourced engineering work as a result of increasing our corporate engineering staff in our technology segment 
offsetting these savings were increased professional fees in our greencert segment associated with patent related costs

depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period ended research and development research and development costs were  and  for the years ended and  respectively 
as a result of cost cutting measures  we decreased the number of employees and the corresponding salary and wages in our lab at our fort union facility 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
asset impairment charges for the year ended december   relate to further impairment of our boiler island which was classified as assets held for sale 
see note property plant and equipment in item of this report for further details 
impairment charges for the year ended december  are as follows we suspended operations at our fort union plant to allow us to focus on future k fuel and k direct plants by redirecting constrained resources  both capital and human  to focus on the commercialization of our process 
we incurred impairment charges in our plant segment totaling million  we are required to evaluate the fair value of our boiler  which is classified as held for sale 
as result  of this fair value calculation we impaired the carrying value of our boiler by million in our technology segment  we impaired million of capitalized costs related to projects that we abandoned and or replaced with more cost effective projects in our plant segment  and we impaired capital costs of million related to a previously announced future potential project with a major utility because it was determined not to be economically feasible in our technology segment 

table of contents other income expense interest income interest income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income for the year ended december  was principally attributable to a lower cash balance as well as reduced interest rates during interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
interest expense relates to the million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible secured notes due  which we completed in july the increase in interest expense is in direct relation to the time and amount of the notes outstanding in compared to gain on debt for equity exchange transactions during the year ended december   we entered into multiple individually negotiated agreements with certain existing noteholders to exchange million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible secured notes due  for an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
we recognized a million gain  which was reduced by transaction costs  non cash reversal of debt issue costs and non cash adjustment related to the embedded derivatives 
other income expense during the year ended december   other expense was  as compared to million of other expense for the same period ended we estimated the fair value of the embedded derivatives as of july   when the notes were issued  and recorded those values as either assets or liabilities 
in addition  we are required to evaluate the fair value of the embedded derivatives at the end of each subsequent reporting period 
we recognized a decrease in the fair value of the derivatives of  for the year ended december  this fair value adjustment is a non cash item and each quarter s estimation exercise is impacted  in part  by our stock price 
for additional information  see note debt included in item of this report 
in addition we recognized a  gain for insurance reimbursements for cost incurred to repair certain equipment at our fort union plant for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources discussion we have reduced our cash flow used in operations by million when comparing the year ended december  to the same period in we accomplished these savings principally by suspending operations at our fort union plant  reducing corporate professional fees  and other general and administrative cost reductions 
these cost reductions were offset by the expansion of our greencert operations  including the addition of personnel and other administrative costs associated with developing the business 
in addition  we have invested million in capital expenditures  primarily related to buckeye  greencert s software development and k fuel process development during the year ended december  over the past year  we have been evaluating several alternatives related to our strategic positioning  including the potential sale of buckeye 
as previously discussed  on march   we signed a definitive agreement with rosebud mining company with respect to the sale of buckeye for million  in addition to the release of million of cash reclamation bonds 
the sale is expected to close in april  but in any event no later than june  the proceeds from the sale of buckeye will be used to retire the outstanding notes including fees and accrued interest of 
table of contents million  to fund related transaction expenses estimated at million and for general working capital purposes 
actual cash flows from buckeye s operations have been less than previously anticipated due in part to the depressed economy and the unusually mild summer temperatures in the north east region of the united states  both of which have led to lower than previously forecasted coal prices and reduced coal consumption 
because of these lower than expected results  combined with the on going costs associated with greencert  we were required to raise additional capital in october  january and march  as discussed in more detail below 
however  we continue to require additional capital to fully fund the anticapted development of our greencert technology and expect to investigate sources of additional capital 
because of the immediate need for additional capital to fund operations and the costs to develop greencert  there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue to operate as a going concern for the foreseeable future 
on march   we and certain institutional investors entered into a securities purchase agreement  pursuant to which we agreed to sell an aggregate of  shares of our preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to such investors for gross proceeds of approximately million 
subject to certain ownership limitations  the warrants are immediately exercisable for a five year period after closing at an exercise price of 
per share 
the exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits  stock dividends  combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions 
our net proceeds from the registered direct public offering excluding certain transaction costs and the proceeds  if any  from the exercise of the warrants issued in the offering  were approximately million 
on january   we completed a registered direct public offering and raised gross proceeds of approximately million 
the securities were offered pursuant to a shelf registration statement on form s that was previously declared effective by the sec on january  in total  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the common stock and warrants were sold in units  with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock 
the purchase price per unit is 
subject to certain ownership limitations  the warrants are exercisable commencing six months following the closing date of the offering and for a five year period thereafter at an exercise price of 
the exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment in the case of stock splits  stock dividends  combinations of shares and similar recapitalization transactions 
the net proceeds to us from the registered direct public offering  after deducting placement agent fees and our estimated offering expenses  and excluding the proceeds  if any  from the exercise of the warrants issued in the offering  were approximately million 
on october  we entered into the sale of shares of our series b convertible preferred stock preferred stock pursuant to a private placement offering to institutional investors  representing gross proceeds to us of million  with net proceeds of million  prior to transactions costs 
evergreen plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes 
in march  we executed a senior secured convertible note agreement which provides for the issuance of up to million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured promissory notes the notes in three million tranches 
all three of these tranches were funded during on december   we executed a binding term sheet and then on january  we executed an agreement to extend the maturity of these notes to the earlier of june  or the sale of buckeye 
see further discussion in note debt 
we have a history of losses  deficits and negative operating cash flows and may continue to incur losses in the future 
as stated above  we have dramatically reduced our cash flow used in operations 
continued market disruptions associated with the economic downturn  may lead to lower demand for our technology or products  increased incidence of customers inability to pay their accounts  or 
table of contents insolvency of our customers  any of which could adversely affect our results of operations  liquidity  cash flows  and financial condition 
we continue to evaluate our cash position and cash utilization and may make additional adjustments to capital or certain operating expenditures 
as stated above  we continue to require additional capital to fully fund the development of our greencert technology and expect to investigate sources of additional capital 
further  as we complete our strategic positioning or as opportunities arise to accelerate the expansion of our greencert and k fuel technologies  or our anticipated operating cash flows are less than expected due to among other things  a protracted global economic downturn  we may need to obtain further funding 
we believe we have the ability to raise additional capital from time to time as needed principally through i equity offerings  ii debt or debt offerings  and iii partnering with third parties 
while we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described  we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will be available or be on acceptable terms 
payment obligations the following table summarizes our future commitments as of december  payments due by period thereafter total in thousands operating leases short term debt and purchase commitments consulting and service commitments long term debt total commitments this table does not include accounts payable  accrued liabilities  or asset retirement obligations  which are reported in our december  consolidated balance sheet 
we generally have not included any obligation in which either party has the right to terminate except as discussed below 
additionally  we have not included k fuel royalty payments  as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be made as such payments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties 
we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year relating to office space 
rent expense for the years ended december   and was million  million  and  respectively 
additionally  included in operating leases is the rent obligation associated with our former headquarters totaling  which we have sub leased but are not released from the obligation 
furthermore  included in operating leases is a year port dock lease on the ohio river  which we have the right to cancel upon six months written notice 
if this lease were cancelled as of december   we would be obligated to pay  rather than the entire obligation of million 
this dock lease and the related obligation are included as assets to be sold pursuant to the anticipated sale of buckeye 
consulting and service commitments include an exclusive patent sub license agreement with the developer of a proprietary technology for the measurement of carbon emissions 
the agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide sub license to a technology to standardize the measurement of carbon emissions in energy and agricultural related activities 
the agreement was amended and restated to expand the energy and agricultural activities to all applications of the technology and eliminates other operating requirements 
in order to maintain this licensing arrangement  we are required to make minimum annual royalty payments of  to the developer of the proprietary technology  with each payment extending the arrangement for one year if the parties are in material compliance with the contract 
additionally  consulting and service commitments includes our amended 
table of contents and restated umbrella agreement with bechtel 
through this new program management agreement we committed to provide bechtel with billion in construction contracts through failure to meet this commitment by could cost us up to the million in termination fees  which is included in the above table 
long term debt includes our principal amount due and the interest payments 
short term debt includes our principal amount  exit fees and accrued interest due upon the earlier of the sale of buckeye or june  interest is accrued at of the principal amount 
while our former investment banking firm may claim that we owe them up to million upon the sale of buckeye  and  while the previous potential buyer may claim that we owe them up to an additional  if we do not sell buckeye to them  we do not believe that these fees are payable due to the lack of the counterparties meeting certain performance and contractual criteria in addition to certain verbal understandings reached related thereto 
if claims are made for these contingent payments  we intend to vigorously dispute these claims 
these potential obligations are not included in the table above

critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base estimates on historical experience and or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term 
set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we expect to derive greencert and k fuel revenue from licensing arrangements that include licenses  technical support  and professional services 
for each arrangement  we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists eg  a signed contract  ii delivery of the product has occurred and there are no remaining obligations or substantive customer acceptance provisions and all obligations are satisfied  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the fee is reasonably assured 
any up front fees received are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreements 
as our history related to non coal sale customer relationships is limited  we may be required to change the estimated period over which we recognize our revenue as more information becomes available 
arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence 
if the elements are deemed separable  total consideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned 
if the elements are not deemed separable  total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are critical accounting estimates because i they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers  for which we have limited history  ii the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective  and iii the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material 
accounts and notes receivable and allowances 
receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the past due status of receivables and assessments of risk regarding collectability 
if the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
capitalization of costs 
we expense mine exploration costs as incurred 
once it has been determined that it is economically feasible to extract coal  we begin to capitalize these costs as premining costs 
we have identified the commencement of permitting as the point to begin capitalizing premining costs 
we also capitalize all purchases of machinery  equipment  software  engineering costs and similar expenditures  where the useful life of the asset is greater than one year or the expenditures extends the useful life of an existing asset 
all costs that are directly related to  or allocable to  developing a k fuel plant site are capitalized and separately identified as belonging to that site 
judgment is exercised in determining i if costs extend the life of an asset  ii if costs increase production volumes  and iii the feasibility of extracting coal 
if these judgments are incorrect  we may capitalize more costs than we otherwise should 
mineral rights and mine development 
a significant portion of our coal reserves are controlled through leasing arrangements 
costs to obtain coal lands and leased mineral rights  including capitalized premining costs  are capitalized and depleted to operations using the units of production method based on tons produced utilizing only proven and probable reserves in the depletion base and are assumed to have no residual value 
premining costs include drilling  permitting  county and state filing fees and the initial overburden removal 
we used assumptions such as selling price of coal  cost to mine and a discount rate to value our mines at buckeye 
if the assumptions used to value the proven and probable reserves change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
valuation of long lived assets 
the valuation of our long lived and intangible assets  including the remaining assets at our fort union plant  mineral rights  and patents  have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may 
table of contents not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
asset retirement obligations 
we are required to record the fair value of legally required removal costs and retirement obligations as a liability and we also recorded an offsetting asset 
initially  our asset retirement obligations were recorded at their fair value using an expected cash flow approach  in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflected the range of possible outcomes and a credit adjusted risk free rate were applied 
the liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation 
in determining the initial liability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
in addition  the rate of accretion is based upon our best estimate of the rate at which cost to complete the reclamation will increase 
if these estimates and their related assumptions are incorrect or change in the future  we may be required to increase our obligation 
accounting for stock grants  options and warrants 
we issue stock grants  options and warrants to employees  board of directors and consultants in connection with our various business activities 
in accounting for these awards we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the related instruments  the periods benefited and forfeiture rates 
these estimates may affect such financial statement categories as stockholders equity and general and administrative expense 
if these estimates are incorrect  we may be required to incur additional expense in the future 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
derivatives may be embedded in financial instruments the host instrument 
embedded derivatives are treated as separate derivatives when their economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to those of the host instrument 
the terms of the embedded derivative are similar to those of a stand alone derivative and the combined contract is not held for trading or designated at fair value 
these embedded derivatives are measured at fair value and any subsequent changes are recognized in the statement of operations 
we are required to make estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  estimating the future market price of our common stock and probability of a change in control 
if these assumptions and estimates are incorrect  we may be required to incur additional expense in the future 
accounting for acquisitions 
the acquisition of businesses is an element of our strategy 
we are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements 
for example  the value and estimated life of assets may affect the amount of future period depletion and depreciation expense for the assets as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred 
marketable securities 
as of december  and  our balance sheet reflects and million of marketable securities  which are auction rate securities  respectively 
these auction rate securities consisted of student loan backed securities 
during the year ended december   we reduced the carrying amount of our student loan backed auction rate security by  which is reflected in general and administrative expense 
in february  we entered a reverse repurchase transaction for million of our auction rate security which had a million par value 
in march  we liquidated the auction rate security at million  resulting in a gain of  which has been recorded in other income for the year ended december  recent accounting pronouncements refer to note recent accounting pronouncements of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to risks inherent in operations  we are exposed to the following market risks in our business some of the products used in our mining activities  such as diesel fuel and explosives  are subject to commodity price risk 
through our buckeye subsidiary  we generally consume million to million gallons of fuel per year 
on a per gallon basis based on this usage  a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon would result in an increase to our operating costs of approximately  per year 
alternatively  a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs by approximately  ignoring embedded derivatives  we own or hold no derivative instruments or floating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from such interest bearing securities 
currently  we have no significant foreign operations 
we hold no equity market securities  which are subject to equity market risk relative to our own equity securities
