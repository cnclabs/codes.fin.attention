item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion includes the following sections overview results of operations operating segments liquidity and capital resources environment critical accounting estimates new accounting standards forward looking statements overview corning delivered strong operating results in in spite of the recession that followed last year s global economic decline and financial market disruption 
although results for most of our operating segments were down when compared to last year  we saw demand for display technologies products increase as the year progressed and some strength in our other segments as well 
government incentives helped to improve results in the environmental technologies segment in the second half of the year 
results in the telecommunications segment reflected strength in demand for optical fiber and cable products in china 
in the life sciences segment  we completed the acquisition of axygen bioscience  inc to support our strategy to expand our portfolio of products and enhance global customer access in this business 
we saw an increase in sales of corning gorilla glass  our protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices 
we ended the year on a positive note as sales in most of our segments continued to improve in the fourth quarter of when compared to the third quarter of net income  although substantially lower than the previous year  reflected a number of non operating items in that were not repeated in the current year 
those items are described more fully in the discussion of our profitability below 
in the second half of and in early  the company responded to a decline in demand by scaling back manufacturing operations  reducing research  development  and engineering expenses  reducing capital spending  and reducing operating costs 
in  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments 
we faced other challenges this past year  as well 
in august  an earthquake halted production at one of the company s lcd glass manufacturing facilities in japan 
in mid october  production at our lcd glass manufacturing facility in taichung  taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 
production capacity in taiwan and our ability to quickly resume some manufacturing helped to ease the impact of both of these disruptions 
corning remains committed to a strategy of growing through global innovation while preserving our financial independence 
this strategy has served us well 
our key priorities for are similar to those of the previous four years protect our financial health and invest in the future 
during  we made the following progress on these priorities financial health despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment  our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities 
significant items in included the following our debt to capital ratio at was unchanged from december  operating cash flow for the year was billion 
we ended the year with billion of cash and short term investments  which was approximately million higher than last year 
profitability for the year ended december   we generated net income of billion or per share compared to net income of billion or per share for when compared to last year  the decline in net income was due largely to the following items the absence of certain tax adjustments totaling billion which included a billion valuation allowance release in on our deferred tax assets resulting from a change in the judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years 

table of contents the absence of a credit to asbestos litigation expense of million reflecting the change in the estimate of our asbestos litigation liability compared to expense of million reported in the current year 
in the first quarter of  corning reduced its liability for asbestos litigation by million as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms established in for additional information on this matter  refer to note investments to the consolidated financial statements and item legal proceedings 
lower net income in the display technologies segment due to lower volume and lower prices 
the impact of restructuring charges in totaling million for costs associated with workforce reductions in all of our operating segments 
the decrease in net income in was offset somewhat by million from the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates along with lower operating expenses resulting from the company s restructuring activities 
investing in our future we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating and making keystone components that enable high technology systems 
while our spending levels for research  development and engineering were lower in when compared to  we remain committed to investing in research  development  and engineering to drive innovation 
we continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix lcds  diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards  and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that enable fiber to the premises 
we continue to make investments in promising technologies such as the epic system  synthetic green lasers  and advanced flow reactors 
in  we are broadening our innovation strategy to include a focus on opportunities that are adjacent or closely related to our existing capabilities 
these opportunities  which include products such as gorilla glass for consumer products and thin film photovoltaics for solar applications  leverage existing materials or manufacturing processes with slight modifications 
our research  development and engineering expenditures decreased by million in when compared to  but remained somewhat constant as a percentage of net sales 
reduced spending in was driven primarily by the impact of restructuring actions and cost reduction efforts 
we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 
our capital expenditures have been focused on expanding manufacturing capacity in the display technologies segment in anticipation of a larger display market in and growing demand for corning s gorilla glass 
in december  we announced a year capital expenditure plan to locate a glass manufacturing facility at sharp corporation s plant in sakai city  japan 
we continued to advance this project to align with sharp corporation s progress on their adjoining facility and in october of  the facility was opened 
in february  we announced a million expansion of our lcd manufacturing facility in taichung  taiwan 
given the dramatic changes to the global economic landscape and the decline in demand for our products in late  we stopped further expansion in taiwan 
total capital expenditures for were million 
approximately million was directed toward our display technologies segment in  of which about million related to construction in approximately million in was invested in our environmental technologies segment 
we expect our capital spending to be about million to million  but there could also be up to million of additional spending for adjacent opportunities  possible capacity in china  and precious metals to support growing capacity 
approximately million to million will be directed toward our display technologies segment 
corporate outlook our outlook for is favorable 
although we believe our sales and profitability will continue to be buffeted by the difficult global economic climate  we believe worldwide demand for lcd glass will continue to increase 
we expect sales in to be higher than driven by continued strength in demand for lcd televisions  computer notebooks  and desktop monitors 
we believe gross margin will expand driven by improvements in the display and environmental technologies segments 
we think equity earnings will improve as well 
we expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in line with recent years 
we will monitor the levels of recovery in certain of our businesses and we may incur further charges to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity  where necessary 
we will continue to focus on protecting our financial health  controlling our costs  and accelerating new products while maintaining our emphasis on research and development investments for longer term growth 
we may take advantage of acquisition opportunities that support the long term strategies of our businesses  such as our recent purchase of axygen 
we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation  while preserving our financial stability  will enable our continued long term success

net sales net sales in decreased due to lower sales in the majority of our segments when compared to  driven primarily by volume and price declines in the display technologies segment offset somewhat by million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
the largest portion of the net sales decline occurred in the first quarter of as lcd glass demand fell rapidly in response to worsening economic conditions 
over the remainder of  we saw demand levels for lcd glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels and  we believe  a corresponding expansion in the lcd industry supply chain as demand for lcd televisions improved 
in the fourth quarter of  net sales increased when compared to the same period last year and when compared to the third quarter of  driven by increased net sales in the display technologies segment 
for the full year of  lower volume in the environmental technologies and telecommunications segments also contributed to the decline in net sales as demand for automotive products declined and spending for telecommunications networks contracted 
net sales in were up slightly when compared to  primarily due to the positive impact of million from the movement in foreign exchange rates offset by volume and price declines in a number of our segments as sales results followed the changing global economic conditions in net sales for the first half of were up when compared with the first half of  but down for the second half of when compared to the second half of  as the lcd glass market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened with deteriorating economic conditions

as a percentage of net sales  selling  general  and administrative expenses in were up slightly because the rate of decline in sales exceeded the rate of decline in spending for selling  general  and administrative costs 
the slight decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for when compared to  in dollars  resulted from a decrease in performance based compensation costs caused by the impact of the decline in profitability in most of our operating segments in the second half of the types of expenses included in the selling  general and administrative expenses line item are salaries  wages and benefits  travel  sales commissions  professional fees  and depreciation and amortization  utilities  and rent for administrative facilities

research  development  and engineering expenses increased by million in when compared to  but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales 
the largest driver of increased spending was for the development of new businesses 
restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits corning recorded restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits in and in  which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented 
a description of those charges follows restructuring actions in response to anticipated lower sales in  we recorded charges of million in primarily for a corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce our global workforce 
the charges included costs for severance  special termination benefits  outplacement services  and the impact of a million curtailment loss for postretirement benefits in total cash expenditures associated with these actions are expected to be approximately million  with the majority of spending completed by we estimate annualized savings from these actions will be about million and will be reflected largely in cost of sales and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment 

table of contents asbestos litigation in  we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of million compared to a net decrease of million in the net decrease in was due primarily to a million reduction to our estimated liability for asbestos litigation that was recorded in the first quarter of  as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under more recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms that had been established in for the remainder of  we recorded net credit adjustments of million to reflect the change in value of the estimated settlement liability 
in we recorded an increase to our asbestos litigation liability of million for the change in the estimated fair value of the components of the asbestos litigation liability under terms established in our asbestos litigation liability was estimated to be million at december   compared with an estimate of million at december  the entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than months after the proposed plan is ultimately effective  and a portion of the obligation fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning s investment in pce currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment

equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments in millions years ended december  samsung corning precision dow corning samsung corning all other total equity earnings the increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies in was driven by samsung corning precision when compared to the same period last year 
equity earnings at samsung corning precision reflected increased volume  manufacturing efficiency gains  and the positive impact of million from movements in foreign exchange rates  offset somewhat by lower pricing when compared to the increase in equity earnings of affiliated companies reflected strong sales and earnings performance at both samsung corning precision and dow corning when compared to the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained more fully in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 
the decline in equity earnings from dow corning in was primarily due to lower sales and restructuring charges at dow corning  offset somewhat by the impact of excess foreign tax credits on foreign dividends when compared to the previous year 
sales at dow corning declined in when compared to the prior year and included volume declines in dow corning s traditional silicone businesses that were offset somewhat by an increase in volume at hemlock semiconductor corporation hemlock  dow corning s consolidated subsidiary that makes high purity polycrystalline for the semiconductor and solar industries 
sales of dow corning s traditional silicone businesses reflected the impact of the economic downturn in sales at hemlock increased in  driven by improvements in sales for solar applications when compared to movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact equity earnings from dow corning 
dow corning s performance was driven by sales growth in its traditional silicone product lines and at hemlock 
dow corning sales grew in with the largest growth at hemlock 
sales of dow corning s traditional silicone product lines were also higher when compared to net income at dow corning  and corning s resulting equity earnings from dow corning  increased in when compared to  reflecting the growth in net sales along with the positive impact from both a change in depreciation method and a change in the useful lives of certain fixed assets  offset in part by an other than temporary impairment for certain securities of fannie mae and freddie mac 
our share of this impairment was million 

table of contents sales at dow corning in are expected to increase greater than when compared to  driven by higher sales of silicone products and an increase in sales at hemlock

in  income before income taxes included million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to in  income before income taxes  included million for the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the previous year 
provision for income taxes our benefit provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions years ended december  benefit provision for income taxes effective income tax benefit rate the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items rate differences on income losses of consolidated foreign companies  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  the benefit of tax holidays and investment credits in foreign jurisdictions  the benefit of the us research and experimentation tax credit for years  the benefit of recording additional deferred taxes for the tax exempt subsidy attributable to our opeb liability  and the impact of the net increase in valuation allowances due to changes in judgment on the realizability of certain state and foreign deferred tax assets 
the effective income tax benefit rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items the release of billion of valuation allowances attributable to a change in judgment about the realizability of us deferred tax assets in future years  described below  the impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the us  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  
table of contents the benefit of tax holidays and investment and other credits in foreign jurisdictions  and a million benefit related to a favorable tax settlement with the canadian revenue agency 
the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items the impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the us  the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets  the impact of equity in earnings of affiliated companies  and the benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions 
prior to  we recorded valuation allowances against our us deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the us in  we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income 
as more fully described in note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements  all of our us deferred tax assets had full valuation allowances until the second quarter of at that time  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the us as a result  we released billion of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets in the second quarter of we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance was needed 
the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective 
following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of positive pre tax income in the us for the first half of and the preceding year  the impact of positive results in the display technologies operating segment and the royalty income generated from the foreign locations in this segment  the number of years remaining to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  and increased confidence in our longer term forecasted income levels  which were supported by detailed sensitivity analyses 
at june   the following items were considered as negative evidence in our valuation allowance assessment  but were less heavily weighted than our positive evidence uncertainty of future taxable earnings  historical utilization of deferred tax assets caused largely by non recurring items  and economic and consumer demand uncertainty 
deferred tax liabilities totaled million at december   and therefore  were not a significant factor in our assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets 
us profits of approximately billion dollars will be required to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december  of that amount  billion of us profits will be required over the next years to fully realize the deferred tax assets associated with federal net operating loss carry forwards 
in and  we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income 
the impact of the release of the valuation allowances  and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the us  was a reduction in our effective tax rate of and percentage points for and  respectively 
certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards  as well as other federal and state tax credits  will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of december   because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire 
the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that had valuation allowances at december  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents we do not provide income taxes on the post earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover tax free without significant cost 
income taxes have been provided for post unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover tax free 
unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before december  have been indefinitely reinvested 
we currently provide us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted 
as of december   us taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings that are expected to remain invested indefinitely 
it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on those earnings 
in  we recorded valuation allowances against our entire german deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years 
in  due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall german operations  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the german national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance was no longer required 
the impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of percentage points for certain foreign subsidiaries in china and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements 
the nature and extent of such arrangements vary  and the benefits of such arrangements phase out through according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions 
the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of  and percentage points for  and  respectively 
while we expect the amount of unrecognized tax benefits to change in the next months  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or our financial position 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding income tax matters 
net income attributable to corning incorporated as a result of the items discussed above  net income and per share data was as follows in millions  except per share amounts years ended december  net income attributable to corning incorporated basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share shares used in computing per share amounts basic earnings per common share diluted earnings per common share operating segments effective january   corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the company s focus on new business development and later stage research projects and to provide more transparency on our specialty materials operating segment 
as a result  our segment reporting includes the following changes that are in accordance with the requirements for disclosures about segments we have provided separate financial information for the specialty materials operating segment 
this operating segment was previously included in all other 
certain later stage development projects  such as advanced flow reactors and green lasers  meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in all other 
spending for these projects was previously part of exploratory research and was reported in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to total net income 
certain other new product lines meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in all other 
spending related to these businesses was previously included in our life sciences and display technologies operating segments 
our reportable operating segments are now as follows display technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays 
telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry 
environmental technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications 
this reportable operating segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods 

table of contents specialty materials manufactures products that provide more than material formulations for glass  glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs 
life sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications 
all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as all other 
this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 
we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment s net income 
we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us us gaap 
segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we began providing us income tax expense or benefit on us earnings losses due to the change in our conclusion about the realizability of our us deferred tax assets in as a result of the change in our tax position  we adjusted the allocation of taxes to our operating segments in to reflect this difference 
the impact of changing our allocation methodology was not significant

the decrease in net sales in  reflected price declines of and a decline in volume of measured in square feet of glass sold offset somewhat by the positive impact of million from movements in foreign exchange rates 
net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and  as a result  are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate 
when compared to last year  the volume decline in occurred largely in the first quarter of and reflected a number of industry dynamics 
because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers  supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in corning s volume 
during the second half of  the lcd market experienced a supply chain contraction that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined 
we believe the industry supply chain contraction ended in the first quarter of  followed by replenishment in the second quarter 
over the remainder of  we saw demand levels for lcd glass increase in comparison to first quarter levels 
in the fourth quarter of  net sales increased when compared to the same period last year and when compared to the third quarter of with increasing demand over the course of  we strategically restarted some capacity that had been temporarily idled towards the end of last year 
in the third quarter of  an earthquake in shizuoka  japan halted production at the company s lcd glass manufacturing facility located there 
in the fourth quarter of  production at the company s lcd glass manufacturing facility in taichung  taiwan was impacted by a power disruption 
incremental production capacity and the ability to resume some manufacturing in our affected facilities helped to ease the impact of both disruptions and support lcd glass shipments 
we believe our market share was negatively impacted because our capacity was lower during a period when demand remained robust 
the company incurred approximately million of costs for accelerated depreciation charges and asset write offs from these events 
in  equity earnings of samsung corning precision reflected the positive impact of million from movements in foreign exchange rates and an increase in volume of offset somewhat by price declines of when compared to the same period last year 
equity earnings from samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates 
results of samsung corning precision reflected improvements in the overall lcd glass market which grew approximately in when compared to previous year 
the economic recession has had a greater impact on our wholly owned business in taiwan than on samsung corning precision 
since taiwanese panel makers do not have strong brand recognition  they are the first to experience supply chain corrections and slower to benefit from improvements in demand 

table of contents when compared to  the decline in net income in was primarily due to the impact of volume and price declines  costs associated with the earthquake in japan  and restructuring charges in the first quarter of these items were offset somewhat by million from the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates and stronger equity earnings 
net income of this segment in included million of restructuring charges associated with the company s corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in net income also includes royalty income from samsung corning precision  which was higher in when compared to last year reflecting the improvements in sales volume at samsung corning precision

the net sales increase for the display technologies segment in resulted from a slight improvement in volume measured in square feet of glass sold along with a million positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates  offset by price declines of when compared to net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and  as a result  are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate 
in the first half of  glass volume of this segment increased by  when compared to the same period in driven by lcd television market growth and demand for lcd monitors and notebook computers 
in the second half of  as a result of worsening global economic conditions  our lcd glass volume declined by when compared to the second half of the largest decline in our glass volume occurred in the fourth quarter when volume fell about when compared to the prior year 
the overall lcd glass market grew approximately in growth rates by region differed dramatically  resulting in volume in our wholly owned business increasing only while volume at samsung corning precision in korea increased compared to the lower growth rate in our wholly owned business was caused in part by a decline in volume in taiwan  particularly in the second half of the year  and reflected a number of key market dynamics 
as described above  taiwanese panel makers do not have as strong of brand recognition with consumers as do korean and japanese panel makers 
in addition  a number of taiwanese panel makers were providing capacity to customers that also produce their own lcd panels  and as demand has slowed  purchases of this excess capacity declined 
fluctuating exchange rates also appear to have made korean panel makers more competitive during the industry downturn in finally  we believe the taiwanese panel makers had to reduce production to align their inventory levels with lower demand 
when compared to  net income for was up primarily due to improvements in equity earnings from samsung corning precision and the positive impact of movement in foreign exchange rates 
these improvements were offset somewhat by lower volume and price declines in corning s wholly owned business 
during the first half of  operating performance at corning s wholly owned business benefited from manufacturing facilities that were running at or near capacity 
as demand leveled off in the third quarter and then sharply declined in the fourth quarter  we temporarily idled certain production assets 
these actions resulted in accelerated depreciation for glass tanks that were taken out of production earlier than planned 
by the end of  more than half of the manufacturing capacity in our wholly owned business was temporarily idled 
equity earnings from samsung corning precision s lcd business for increased by when compared to  due to volume gains of  improved manufacturing performance  and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines of 
samsung corning precision experienced a similar  but less severe  decline in second half performance 
at the end of  samsung corning precision had idled approximately of its capacity 
equity earnings for were positively impacted by approximately million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to other information the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan 
for and  three customers of the display technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for and  respectively  of total segment sales when combined 
our customers face the same global economic dynamics as we do in this market 
we believe panel makers in taiwan have been more significantly impacted by the economic downturn given their relative size when compared to korean panel makers who have a stronger presence in the end market for lcd products 
while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues  our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 
in addition  samsung corning precision s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers 
in and  sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea accounted for and  respectively  of samsung corning precision sales 

table of contents corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for lcd glass substrates 
in  and  capital spending in this segment was million  billion  and million  respectively 
we expect capital spending for to be approximately million to million 
in and  several of corning s customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which corning s display technologies segment would supply large size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years 
as part of the agreements  these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased 
we received our last deposit of million in july and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 
during  and  we issued million  million  and million  respectively  in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due 
in the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits 
if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers deposits 
refer to note other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
outlook we expect the overall lcd glass market in  measured in square feet of glass  will increase by approximately to when compared to  resulting from increased demand for lcd televisions and computer notebook sales 
we expect gross margin to expand in driven by increased volume  cost reduction  and moderate price declines 
we think regional market share will stabilize although regional mix shifts as described  that benefit volume at samsung corning precision more than corning s wholly owned business  remain possible 
we will also pursue growth opportunities in china as that country s lcd tv market continues to grow 
although the lcd supply chain has been impacted by the global recession  we believe that the long term drivers of this market  specifically increased penetration of lcd into the total television market  increased screen size and increased televisions per household  remain intact 
in the first quarter of  we expect volume at our wholly owned business to increase to and volume at samsung corning precision to be flat to up slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of we expect moderate price declines in the first quarter of at both our wholly owned business and samsung corning precision when compared to the fourth quarter of the end market demand for lcd televisions  monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending  among other things 
we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions  particularly the global economic recession  and world political tensions could have on consumer demand 
while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years  economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes  prices  or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth 
therefore  it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time 
we may incur further charges in this segment to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates  principally the japanese yen  will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 
telecommunications dollars in millions change vs

net sales optical fiber and cable hardware and equipment total net sales net income vs 
in  net sales of this segment decreased when compared to the same period last year and reflected declines across all of our businesses 
when compared to the previous year  lower volumes in both north america and europe were offset somewhat by higher net sales for optical fiber and cable in china as the country continues to expand its telecommunications infrastructure 
volume in north america and europe reflected the continuing impact of the economic recession 
in addition  net sales of this segment were negatively impacted by million from movements in foreign exchange rates 

table of contents for  the decline in net income reflected the volume impacts as described above and the impact of restructuring charges  offset somewhat by lower operating expenses resulting from restructuring actions when compared to net income of this segment included the impact of million of restructuring charges in associated with the company s corporate wide restructuring plan 
actions in this segment included workforce reductions  the consolidation of manufacturing operations that resulted in the closure of two plants and the exit of some minor businesses 
movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of net income for the periods presented

in and  two customers of the telecommunications segment  which individually accounted for more than of total segment net sales  collectively accounted for and  respectively  of total segment sales when combined 
vs 
net sales for the segment were up slightly over primarily due to volume gains in fiber to the premises products and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
increased sales in fiber to the premises products reflected strong demand in europe  and north america 
the increase was partially offset by moderating price declines  reduced demand for copper based products in europe and the absence of sales from corning s european submarine cabling business that was sold in april net income in included million for the cost of a restructuring plan that was implemented in the fourth quarter 
the decline in net income in reflected the impact of the restructuring charge  price declines  higher operating expenses  and the absence of a million gain on the sale of the european submarine cabling business when compared to in  movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the net income of this segment 
outlook we expect net sales of the telecommunications segment to be down in  driven by a decline in demand for private and public network products  lower spending for telecommunications infrastructure in china in  and lower sales due to the exit of certain businesses in changes in our customers expected deployment plans  or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products  could also affect sales levels 
should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated  our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 
in the first quarter of  we expect net sales of this segment to be down to  when compared to the fourth quarter of  due to lower demand for private network products and fiber demand in china

in the first quarter of  us automotive builds were at their lowest levels since corning entered this business 
in the first half of  net sales of this segment declined when compared to the first half of in the second half of  year over year net sales were up when compared to the same period last year due to government incentives in china  europe and the us in addition  we believe inventories at automotive manufacturers and dealers returned to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter of  which also caused increased demand 
diesel product sales in reflected the impact of the recession driven weak freight industry in the us this was offset somewhat by improved demand in the second half of as engine manufacturers prepared for next year s stricter heavy duty diesel emission standards 
net sales in were negatively impacted by million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the same period last year 

table of contents net loss in reflected lower sales and manufacturing volume of both automotive and diesel products  offset somewhat by lower operating expenses  when compared to net income in addition  net loss of this segment in included the impact of restructuring charges 
restructuring charges for this segment totaled million for the company s corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to lower sales in movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the results of this operating segment 
the environmental technologies reportable operating segment sells to a concentrated customer base of catalyzer and emission control systems manufacturers  who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers 
although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers  the use of our substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers 
our customers and their customers are experiencing the negative impact of the automotive and freight industry downturns

while we are not aware of any significant customer credit issues with our direct customers  our near term sales and profitability would be impacted if any individual customers were unable to continue to purchase our products 
vs 
sales of the environmental technologies segment in were down when compared to the previous year and reflected lower sales of automotive and diesel products  offset somewhat by favorable foreign exchange rate movements 
sales of automotive products reflected the significant decline in demand in the european and us automotive industry in the second half of in line with worsening economic conditions 
diesel product sales increased due to the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates  offset somewhat by volume declines 
diesel product sales reflect the continued decline in the us freight industry that began in late net sales of this segment in were positively impacted by million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year 
net income of this segment was down when compared to last year  due primarily to reduced sales volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies in both businesses 
net income was positively impacted by million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to the prior year 
outlook we expect net sales of this segment to improve in driven by moderate growth in demand for automotive products 
we expect to see continued strength in demand due to replenishment of dealer and supply chain inventories through the first quarter of diesel product sales are expected to improve slightly driven by regulation tightening  but will not reflect any significant growth until the freight industry recovers and excess fleet inventory is fully utilized 
when compared to the fourth quarter of  net sales of this segment in the first quarter of  are expected to start strongly but decline in the full quarter as the rebuild of auto inventories nears completion

the specialty materials segment manufactures products that provide more than material formulations for glass  glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs 
consequently  this segment operates in a wide variety of commercial and industrial markets that include consumer electronics  display optics and components  semiconductor optics and components  aerospace and defense  astronomy  ophthalmic products  and telecommunications components 

table of contents net sales decreased in due primarily to lower sales of semiconductor optics and components as a result of the significant market downturn when compared to the prior year 
this decrease was offset somewhat by an increase in sales of gorilla glass  a protective cover glass that is optimized for portable display devices 
sales of gorilla glass have continued to increase as the company moves to capitalize on market opportunities for this product 
the net loss for resulted from the decline in net sales along with manufacturing development costs for gorilla glass when compared to the net loss in also included million of restructuring charges for the company s corporate wide restructuring plan to reduce its global workforce in response to anticipated lower sales in  and costs associated with closing one of this segment s manufacturing facilities 
in  movements in foreign exchange rates did not significantly impact the profitability of this segment 
in the specialty materials segment  there were no individual customers that accounted for or more of this segment s net sales for vs 
when compared to the previous year  net sales were down in due to a decline in sales of semiconductor materials products that were negatively impacted by the global recession  offset somewhat by increased sales of gorilla glass and the favorable impact of movements in foreign exchange rates 
the increase in net loss for this segment was due to the decline in sales along with higher operating expenses for gorilla glass 
for  one customer of the specialty materials segment accounted for of total segment sales 
outlook for  we expect sales of this segment to increase driven by increased sales of gorilla glass when compared to we expect a modest increase in sales of semiconductor products as the semiconductor industry begins to improve

the net proceeds of million were designated for general corporate purposes 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized million of net losses on short term investments 
net losses included other than temporary impairments of million for securities of lehman brothers holdings inc  which filed for bankruptcy protection in mid september  and million for securities which had declined in value and been down graded 
the remaining losses resulted from the sale of asset backed debt securities and debt securities of financial institutions as we reduced our exposure to these sectors 
in addition  we classified million of mortgage backed securities from current assets to long term assets 
through the end of september  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million as part of repurchase programs announced in july and july we have made no additional repurchases

cash flows summary of cash flow data years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities vs 
although net income decreased significantly from  operating cash flow declined only slightly 
the decrease in net income resulted primarily from two non recurring  non cash items the release of billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a million reduction in asbestos related liabilities 
when compared to  operating cash flow in reflected higher pension contributions and restructuring payments  offset somewhat by an increase in cash from changes in working capital and higher dividends from equity affiliates 
net cash used in investing activities was lower in when compared to due to lower capital expenditures in our display technologies segment  offset partially by the acquisition of axygen 
net cash used in financing activities also decreased in when compared to the prior year due to the issuance of long term debt and the discontinuation of common stock repurchases 
vs 
as the significant increase in net income was largely driven by two non cash items  operating cash increased only slightly when compared to the two non cash items were the release of billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a million reduction in asbestos related liabilities 
in addition  cash from operating activities benefited from slower growth in working capital  higher dividends from equity affiliates  and lower contributions for retirement related benefits compared to these benefits were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid and customer deposit credits issued 
net cash used in investing activities in increased when compared to the previous year due to a million increase in capital spending largely attributable to higher spending in the display technologies segment and a smaller reduction in short term investments compared to net cash used in financing activities was higher when compared to the previous year due to an increase in repurchases of common stock and an increase in dividends paid 
corning began paying a quarterly dividend of per share in the third quarter of defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees

our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted 
at december  about half of the consolidated amount was held outside of the us almost all of the amounts held outside of the us are available for repatriation  subject to relevant tax consequences 
we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed

we currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues 
our major source of funding for and beyond will be our operating cash flow and our existing balances of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations  the asbestos litigation  research and development  capital expenditures  scheduled debt repayments  and dividend payments 
corning also has access to a billion unsecured committed credit through november if market conditions are favorable  the company may seek to enter into negotiations with its bank group prior to the expiration date to renew and extend the credit arrangements

off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
corning s off balance sheet arrangements include the following guarantee contracts  and variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities 
at the time a guarantee is issued  the company is required to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees are individually significant 
refer to note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities 
the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 
for variable interest entities  we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity s net assets excluding variable interests 
corning has identified three entities that qualify as variable interest entities 
none of these entities is considered to be significant to corning s consolidated statements of position 
corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity

total debt above is stated at maturity value 
at december   million of the million represents imputed interest 
the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity or expiration of the related debt  based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments 
at december   million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions 
of this amount  we are unable to estimate when million of that amount will become payable 
we are required  at the time a guarantee is issued  to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees are individually significant 
we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan 
the purchase obligations primarily represent raw material and energy related take or pay contracts 
we believe a significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 
environment corning has been named by the environmental protection agency the agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by the agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is corning s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned by corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
at december  and  corning had accrued approximately million undiscounted and million undiscounted  respectively  for its estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation 
based upon the information developed to date  management believes that the accrued reserve is a reasonable estimate of the company s liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates  including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates  that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments follow 
impairment of assets held for use we are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified 
we review our long lived assets in each quarter to assess whether impairment indicators are present 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
manufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals  primarily platinum and rhodium 
these metals are not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life 
precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long lived assets 
this review considers all of the company s precious metals that are either in place in the production process  in reclamation  fabrication  or refinement in anticipation of re use  or awaiting use to support increased capacity 
precious metals are only acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other purposes 
examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include a significant decrease in the market price of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

table of contents for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for the majority of our reporting segments  we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
for long lived assets  when impairment indicators are present  we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value  to the assets carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable 
this assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used 
assessments also consider changes in asset utilization  including the temporary idling of capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production 
if there is an impairment  a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets fair value and carrying value 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and residual values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
the fair value of long lived assets is determined using an income approach that starts with the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows including the eventual disposition at market value of long lived assets  and also considers the fair market value of all precious metals 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions in our analysis include market size and growth  market share  projected selling prices  manufacturing cost and discount rate 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
we believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to market growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions 
the company believes its current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
as of december  and  we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our long lived assets were not recoverable 
at december  the fair market value of precious metals was higher than our carrying value by million 
at december   the fair market value of precious metals was lower than our carrying value by million 
currently these precious metal assets  primarily in the display technologies segment  are recoverable as part of their asset groupings 
there is the potential for impairment in the future if negative events significantly decrease the cash flow of our segments 
such events include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in demand for products of our display technologies segment or a significant decrease in its profitability 
impairment of goodwill we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments on a number of matters  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter  as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process 
this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows 
our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods  plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon  are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
as disclosed in note goodwill and other intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements  corning s goodwill relates primarily to the telecommunications  specialty materials and life sciences operating segments 
telecommunications goodwill for the telecommunication segment is tested at the operating segment level 
we have aggregated the telecommunications operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses  the vertically integrated nature of these operations  shared assets  operating and finance resources  and management  the nature of production processes and the regulatory environment  and the shared support and benefit from common research and development activity 

table of contents results for the telecommunications segment in were down when compared with we expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to be negatively impacted by the global recession with lower sales in than in the results of our impairment tests in indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount 
a discount rate of was used in and was used in we determined a range of discount rates between and would not have affected our conclusion 
specialty materials goodwill for the specialty materials segment is tested at the component level  which is one level below an operating segment  because the goodwill is the result of transactions associated with certain businesses in this operating segment 
although the specialty materials segment had small reported losses in and  we expect in the near term new products will partially offset some of the declines resulting from recent economic conditions  and we anticipate growth in new products will also improve longer term profitability 
the results of our impairment test in and indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its book value 
a discount rate of was used in and was used in we determined a range of discount rates between and would not have affected our conclusion 
life sciences in  the life sciences segment recorded goodwill in connection with the acquisition of axygen 
goodwill for the life sciences segment is tested at the operating segment level 
we have aggregated the life sciences operating segment businesses into a single reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing based on the manner in which we operate our businesses 
results in the life sciences segment in reflected the impact of acquisition related costs and million of restructuring charges associated with the company s corporate wide restructuring plan  when compared to the results of our impairment tests in indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value by a significant amount 
a discount rate of was used in we determined a range of discount rates between and would not have affected our conclusion 
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions we are required to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized 
we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including  for example  employee termination costs 
restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses  of portions thereof  their profitability  cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome 
the judgment involved can be difficult  subjective and complex in a number of areas  including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which  as a result  require impairment 
we are required to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 
income taxes we are required to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results  the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies  and the economic environments in which we do business 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 
in the second quarter of  we released billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the us to realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets 
a key trend included in our projections was the rate of penetration of lcd televisions driven by an increase in televisions per household  faster lcd television replacement rates  the continued decline of cathode ray tube products  and growth in emerging markets such as china 
another key trend included global demand improvements for diesel products based on the timing of new government regulations and economic growth 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we released an additional million  and million  respectively  of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of us taxable income 
significant estimates and assumptions used in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets included the long term stabilization of us income from forecasted royalty income in our display technologies operating segment  the long term growth of our diesel business  and the future success of new products 

table of contents in determining our provision for income taxes  we use an annual effective income tax rate based on full year income  permanent differences between book and tax income  and statutory income tax rates 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide income tax position  as well as the effective tax rate 
equity method investments at december  and  the carrying value of our equity method investments was billion and billion  respectively  with our two largest equity method investments comprising approximately of the balance 
we review our equity method investments for indicators of impairment on a periodic basis or if an event or circumstances change to indicate the carrying amount may be other than temporarily impaired 
when such indicators are present  we then perform an in depth review for impairment 
an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment related to key assumptions such as forecasted revenue and profitability  forecasted tax rates  foreign currency exchange rate movements  terminal value assumptions  historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
as of december  and  we have not identified any instances where the carrying values of our equity method investments were not recoverable 
fair value measures as required  corning uses two kinds of inputs to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable 
observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources  while unobservable inputs are based on the company s own market assumptions 
once inputs have been characterized  we prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels 
characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value measurement 
in addition  observable market data must be used when available 
corning s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments and derivatives 
these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 
derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities 
in arriving at the fair value of corning s derivative assets and liabilities  we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria  including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction 
amounts related to credit risk are not material 
probability of litigation outcomes we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law  and other case specific issues 
see part ii item legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  and our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives 
the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies 
the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and faces objections by some parties 
any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal 
the proposed amended pcc plan is also subject to a vote of pcc s creditors 
for these and other reasons  corning s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters 
the estimate of the cost of resolving the non pcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur 
management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning s financial statements is remote 
other possible liabilities we are required to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters  including certain tax planning and environmental matters  these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 

table of contents variable interest entities the company has interests in certain unconsolidated entities 
these investments are evaluated periodically to determine if they qualify as variable interest entities and whether corning is a primary beneficiary for any of those qualifying interests 
a variable interest entity vie is an entity that lacks sufficient equity investment or in which the equity investors do not have certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest 
a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses or receives a majority of the expected returns of a vie is considered to be a primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
the determination of whether an entity is a vie and if a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie are complex areas that require judgments about items such as the sufficiency of the equity at risk  the evaluation of contractual arrangements  and assessments about forecasted information 
while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate  changes in these judgments or estimates could affect corning s results 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was  million 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans change in assumption effect on pre tax pension expense effect on december  pbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning s funding requirements 
in addition  at december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by million before tax  and a basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by million 
in addition  the impact of greater than a basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first basis point decrease in the discount rate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning s us opeb plans change in assumption effect on pre tax opeb expense effect on december  apbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in certain instances  revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns  allowances  discounts  and other factors 
these estimates are supported by historical data 
while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning s future results 

table of contents stock compensation stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include risk free discount rates  expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted  volatility of stock and option prices  expected time between grant date and date of exercise  attrition  performance  and other factors 
these assumptions require us to exercise judgment 
our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience  currently available market place data  and forward looking explanatory variables 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies that impact earnings  and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
we have foreign currency exposure to the japanese yen  euro  new taiwan dollar and korean won 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and  as such  are referred to as undesignated hedges 
changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges  along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings in other expense income  net in the consolidated statements of income 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments were billion in and with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount in equity earnings from samsung corning precision totaled billion for and million for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had open forward contracts  and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the japanese yen  a adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the euro  a adverse movement in quoted euro exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  as we derive approximately of our net sales from outside the us  our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro 
our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during remain constant at january levels 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
interest rate risk management it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than of variable rate instruments
