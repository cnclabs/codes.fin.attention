all statements other than statements of historical facts are forward looking statements for purposes of these provisions  including those relating to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  project  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend or continue  the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology  and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these statements are only predictions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong 
actual events or results may differ materially 
our forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
we discuss many of these risks  uncertainties and other factors in this annual report on form k in greater detail under the heading item a risk factors 
we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibody based therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases 
we initiated a pivotal trial of our lead product candidate  brentuximab vedotin sgn  during the first quarter of for patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma under an spa with the fda 
the trial was fully enrolled in august and we expect to report data from the trial in the second half of brentuximab vedotin is empowered by our proprietary adc technology comprising highly potent synthetic drugs and stable linkers for attaching the drugs to monoclonal antibodies 
in addition  we have four other product candidates in ongoing clinical trials lintuzumab sgn  dacetuzumab sgn  sgn and sgn in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with millennium to develop and commercialize brentuximab vedotin  under which seattle genetics has united states and canadian commercial rights and millennium has commercial rights in the rest of the world 
we also have collaborations for our adc technology with a number of leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including bayer  celldex  daiichi sankyo  genentech  gsk  medimmune  millennium  and progenics  as well as an adc co development agreement with agensys 
we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
while certain of our product candidates are advancing into later stages of development  such as brentuximab vedotin  significant further research and development  financial resources and personnel will be required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
over the next several years  we expect that we will incur substantial expenses  primarily the result of activities related to the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of brentuximab vedotin  including preparation for commercial manufacturing 
we will also continue to invest in research  development and manufacturing as we plan to move toward potential commercialization of our other product candidates 
our commitment of resources to the approval and commercialization activities for brentuximab vedotin and the research and continued development and potential commercialization of our other product candidates will require substantial additional funds and resources and our operating expenses will also likely increase as a result of such activities 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization 
we expect that a substantial portion of our revenues for the next several years will be the result of amortization of payments already received and expected to be received pursuant to our 
table of contents collaboration agreements 
until such time as we have commercialized a product candidate  our revenues will also depend on the achievement of development and clinical milestones under our existing collaboration and license agreements  particularly our brentuximab vedotin collaboration with millennium  as well as entering into new collaboration and license agreements 
the majority of our revenues for the past three years resulted from our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech 
in december  genentech informed us of its decision to terminate the collaboration effective june  as of december   we had deferred revenue of million recorded on our balance sheet related to the dacetuzumab collaboration 
as a result of the termination of the agreement  we expect to recognize this amount as revenue in the first half of in addition  as a result of the termination  if we decide to continue development of dacetuzumab  we will be responsible for and will be required to solely fund any new dacetuzumab development and clinical trial activities undertaken after the collaboration ends  which could result in a significant delay in the dacetuzumab development process 
if we determine instead to discontinue the development of dacetuzumab  we will not receive any additional return on our investment from that product candidate 
our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and  as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we have entered into licensing and collaboration agreements that contain multiple revenue elements including upfront payments  license fees  milestone payments  royalties  maintenance fees and payments for the delivery of supplies or services provided 
each agreement may contain some or all of these elements 
revenue recognition is predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing  delivery of materials or services being rendered  fees being fixed or determinable  and collectibility being reasonably assured 
agreements that include multiple elements are evaluated to determine whether the associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting 
in order to be considered a separate unit of accounting  a deliverable must have standalone value to the customer and we must have objective and reliable evidence of its fair value 
to date  the deliverables under our collaboration agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting and revenue is typically recognized over our performance obligation period under each agreement 
we generally use a time based proportional performance model to recognize our revenue over the performance period as further discussed below 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time  or period of time  that revenue should be recognized 
nonrefundable upfront license payments  option and maintenance fees and milestone payments our collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license payments  option and maintenance fees  and payments triggered by the achievement of development milestones by the other party or by us 
when we have substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized over the performance period of the obligations 
under the time based proportional performance method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
changes in estimates of the total expected performance period are accounted for prospectively when a change becomes known 
revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount of non contingent payments received or due 
when we have no substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone event 

table of contents research and development services we may also perform research and development activities on behalf of collaborative partners that are paid for by the collaborator 
when no other obligation to provide services is required by us  revenue from research and development services is generally recognized as the service is provided 
however  if the arrangement provides for other ongoing services by us or contains multiple delivery elements which do not qualify as separate units of accounting  amounts due for such services are recognized as revenue over the service period 
royalties revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  we have not received significant royalty revenues 
we generally invoice our collaborators on a monthly or quarterly basis  or upon the completion of the effort  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts due  but not billed to a collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue arises from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process and is recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability 
investments 
our investments are diversified among a variety of debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in investment income 
to date  we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
as described below under liquidity and capital resources we use a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis to value our investment in auction rate securities 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials  fees due in conjunction with manufacturing clinical grade materials and professional service fees 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses would differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other headcount related costs of our research and development staff  preclinical activities  clinical trials  lab supplies  manufacturing costs for product candidates used in research and clinical trials  contract and outside service fees and facilities and overhead expenses 
research and development activities are expensed as incurred 
in licensing fees  including milestones and maintenance fees  and other costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in 
table of contents research and development and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognize this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial  continuing through patient accrual into the clinical trial and completion of the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments for clinical trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
costs associated with activities performed under research and development co development collaborations are reflected in research and development expense 
non refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
share based compensation 
we expense the fair value of share based payment transactions in our consolidated financial statements 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management  including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
for additional information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as we expect to incur operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to pursue the development of our product candidates 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  share based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues in increased by to million from  and increased by in to million from our revenues reflect amounts earned under our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech entered into in january  the earned portion of technology access fees and milestone payments received under our adc collaborations  including funded research and material supply fees  and to a lesser degree  our brentuximab vedotin collaboration agreement entered into with millennium in december revenues are summarized by collaborator as follows collaboration and license agreement revenue by collaborator in thousands annual percentage change genentech agensys  n a n a daiichi sankyo  n a millennium  n a n a other collaborations total

genentech has notified us of its election to terminate the dacetuzumab collaboration effective june   following which time  if we decide to continue development of dacetuzumab  we will be responsible for and will be required to solely fund any new dacetuzumab development and clinical trial activities 
as of december   we carried million in deferred revenue related to this collaboration that we expect to recognize as revenue during the first half of we expect that revenues will increase compared to this is primarily the result of the recognition of million in deferred revenue from the dacetuzumab collaboration as well as amounts expected to be earned under our new collaboration with millennium for brentuximab vedotin 
revenue may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their adc product candidates  the level of support we provide to our collaborators  the timing of milestones achieved and our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
in addition to amounts related to the dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech  we have a significant balance of deferred revenue  representing prior payments from collaborators that have not yet been earned as revenue 
this deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in future periods using a time based approach as we fulfill our performance obligations 
genentech we entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement with genentech  a wholly owned member of the roche group  in january for the development and commercialization of dacetuzumab 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and progress dependent milestone payments of million 
genentech also funded ongoing research  development and manufacturing costs for dacetuzumab under the collaboration 
in december  genentech informed us that it had elected to terminate the collaboration 
under the terms of the collaboration  the effective date of the termination will be june  at which time all rights to dacetuzumab will be returned to us 
genentech will remain responsible for funding development costs associated with completing all clinical trials for dacetuzumab that are ongoing as of the effective date of termination  and we will be required to bear all of such costs following such date which could result in a significant delay in the dacetuzumab development process 
our adc collaboration with genentech  described below  was unaffected by this termination 
prior to genentech s election to discontinue the dacetuzumab collaboration  we had been recognizing amounts received from genentech under this collaboration as revenue over the six year development period of the agreement using a time based method 
upon receipt of genentech s notice to end the collaboration  the remaining term of the collaboration period was reduced to six months and amounts previously deferred are being recognized over this remaining period 
as of december   we had million of deferred revenue on our balance sheet related to this collaboration 
in april  we entered into an adc collaboration with genentech 
since entering into the multi year agreement  genentech has paid us more than million in upfront fees  milestones  access fees and equity purchases  including million during in addition  we received other fees as well as reimbursement payments for research and development services and materials provided to genentech under the collaboration 
these payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the research term of the collaboration using a time based approach 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as genentech s adc product candidates progress through development and royalties on product sales of such product candidates 

table of contents agensys in january  we entered into an agreement with agensys to jointly research  develop and commercialize adcs for cancer 
the agreement was expanded and modified in november in connection with the expanded agreement  agensys paid us an upfront payment of million 
agensys will conduct preclinical studies aimed at identifying adc product candidates for multiple designated antigens 
we are currently co developing asg me  and we have the right to exercise a co development option for two additional adc product candidates upon submission of an ind 
agensys has the right to develop and commercialize the other adc product candidates on its own  subject to paying us fees  milestones and royalties 
either party may opt out of co development and profit sharing in return for receiving milestones and royalties from the continuing party 
amounts received for product candidates being developed solely by agensys will be recognized as revenue over the development term of the modified collaboration agreement using a time based approach 
daiichi sankyo in july  we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with daiichi sankyo 
we received a million upfront fee for an exclusive license to our adc technology to a single antigen target 
the upfront fee and other payments received are being recorded as revenue over the three year development term of the collaboration agreement using a time based approach 
revenues under our adc collaboration with daiichi sankyo increased by million  or  in revenues during  the first year of the collaboration  totaled  revenues reflect the earned portion of the upfront fee and reimbursement payments for materials and services supplied by us to daiichi sankyo under the collaboration 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as daiichi sankyo s adc product candidate progresses through development and royalties on product sales 
millennium in march  we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with millennium 
we received a million upfront fee for an exclusive license to our adc technology for a single antigen 
millennium also can exercise options for exclusive licenses to two other antigens upon payment of additional fees to us 
the upfront fee and other payments received are being recorded as revenue over the three year development term of the collaboration agreement using a time based approach 
revenue in reflects the earned portion of the upfront fee and payments for materials and services supplied by us to millennium under this collaboration 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as millennium s adc product candidate progresses through development and royalties on net sales of resulting adc products 
millennium is responsible for research  product development  manufacturing and commercialization of all products under the collaboration 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with millennium to globally develop and commercialize brentuximab vedotin  under which seattle genetics has united states and canadian commercial rights and millennium has commercial rights in the rest of the world 
under the collaboration  we received an upfront payment of million and we are entitled to receive progress and sales dependent milestone payments in addition to royalties based on net sales of brentuximab vedotin within millennium s licensed territories 
we and millennium are each funding percent of the joint development costs under the collaboration 
in japan  millennium is solely responsible for development costs 
the upfront fee and other payments received will be recorded as revenue over the development term of the collaboration agreement  currently estimated at eight years  using a time based approach 
other collaborations other collaboration revenue includes adc collaboration agreements that generated lower amounts of revenue during the periods presented  collaborative agreements that have concluded  research agreements established to explore future business relationships and royalty payments from suppliers to which we have granted limited access to our technology under preferred provider agreements 

table of contents research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from  and increased to million in from our research and development expenses are summarized as follows research and development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation expense total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new monoclonal antibodies and related technologies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and potent cell killing drugs for our adc technology 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates  such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses decreased during from due to reallocation of staffing to our development groups and reduced lab supplies costs as we have focused more of our resources on product development  manufacturing and clinical activities 
research expenses increased moderately during from the increase in resulted from building related service costs and contracted costs 
development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials as well as conformance lot and chemistry  manufacturing and controls  or cmc  activities in support of the planned nda submission to the fda for brentuximab vedotin in the first half of development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  including storage and shipment services of our product candidates for clinical trials 
development and contract manufacturing costs increased to million in from  and to million in from these increases were primarily driven by increased manufacturing activities  including increased brentuximab vedotin manufacturing activities in  and increased brentuximab vedotin and dacetuzumab manufacturing activities in development and contract manufacturing expenses also increased in and as a result of higher compensation costs related to an increase in staffing levels 
clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs including clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges  contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials  including ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
clinical costs increased to million in from  and increased to million in from the increases related primarily to higher third party clinical trial costs for brentuximab vedotin in  and for brentuximab vedotin  dacetuzumab and lintuzumab in in addition  compensation costs increased in both and as a result of increased staffing levels 
share based compensation expense reflects the non cash charge associated with stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related share based payment 
share based compensation expense increased to million in from and to million in from the increase for was primarily attributable to a larger number of optioned shares subject to expense recognition during as a result of increased staffing levels 
the increase in was primarily due to the higher weighted average grant date fair value of stock options expensed in compared to 
table of contents certain amounts reported in comparable prior periods in the table above have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation as it relates to the categorization of certain expenses 
we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development projects as well as our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs for our adc program 
we track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning 
we do not account for actual costs on a project by project basis as it relates to our infrastructure  facility  employee and other indirect costs 
we do  however  separately track significant third party costs including clinical trial costs  manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project by project basis 
the following table shows expenses incurred for preclinical study support  contract manufacturing for clinical supplies and clinical and regulatory services provided by third parties as well as milestone payments for in licensed technology for each of our product candidates

increased clinical trials costs reflected our pivotal trial of brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma that was initiated in early  and a phase ii clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory salcl  together with phase i clinical trials 
increased manufacturing costs include the costs of resupply of drug product for clinical trials and manufacturing activities in support of the planned nda submission to the fda for brentuximab vedotin in the first half of third party costs for brentuximab vedotin increased in from  primarily due to manufacturing costs at our contract manufacturing organizations to provide clinical supplies of drug product 
higher costs in also reflected the expansion of phase i clinical trials of brentuximab vedotin during the year 
our third party costs for dacetuzumab decreased by in from this decrease was primarily due to decreased manufacturing activity 
third party costs for dacetuzumab increased by in from  reflecting manufacturing activities for additional drug product and clinical trials costs related to our phase i and phase ii trials  most notably the phase iib clinical trial evaluating dacetuzumab in combination with standard therapy in relapsed or refractory non hodgkin lymphoma patients 
under our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement  genentech currently reimburses us for activities that we perform under the agreement 
expenses that we incur under the dacetuzumab collaboration are included in our research and development expense  while reimbursements of those expenses by genentech are recognized as revenues over the development term of the agreement 
as previously discussed  this collaboration is expected to terminate on june   after which time if we decide to continue development of dacetuzumab  we will be responsible for and will be required to solely fund any new development costs 

table of contents our third party costs for lintuzumab decreased by in from this decrease was primarily due to decreased clinical trial costs  primarily related to the ongoing phase iib trial evaluating the combination of lintuzumab with low dose cytarabine in patients with aml  which completed patient enrollment in early our third party costs for lintuzumab increased by in from the increase was attributable to clinical trial activities  particularly the ongoing phase iib trial 
data from this trial are expected in the second quarter of our third party costs for asg me increased by in from primarily as a result of manufacturing costs incurred to begin securing drug product for phase i clinical trials planned for third party costs increased in from reflecting growth in the program which began during our third party costs for sgn moderately decreased in compared to and increased in compared to reflecting pharmacology toxicology activities and manufacturing costs incurred in to enable the ind submission that occurred in a phase i clinical trial was initiated in late our third party costs for sgn decreased in and in the decrease in reflected lower pharmacology toxicology and clinical trials costs 
the decrease in reflected lower scale up and gmp manufacturing costs of drug product 
other costs and overhead included costs associated with personnel and facilities 
these costs increased by in and by in  primarily reflecting an increase in staffing levels in our development and clinical groups from the comparable prior year periods 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number and location of sites included in the trials  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy includes entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date may largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that our total research  development  contract manufacturing and clinical expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we prepare to seek regulatory approval for and potentially commercialize brentuximab vedotin  as well as continue our preclinical activities and advance new product candidates into clinical trials 
in particular  we expect that development costs for brentuximab vedotin will increase in 
table of contents compared to  reflecting clinical development and manufacturing activities as well as cmc activities associated with our planned nda submission in we expect our development costs for dacetuzumab to decrease in compared to  reflecting lower manufacturing and clinical trials activities for this program in expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
for example  we currently anticipate that data will be available for the phase iib trial of lintuzumab in combination with low dose cytarabine in the second quarter of if the results of this trial are positive  we expect that third party costs associated with the lintuzumab program will increase 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product candidate

share based compensation expense reflects the non cash charge associated with stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related share based payment 
share based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from  and to million in from the increase for was primarily attributable to a larger number of optioned shares subject to expense recognition during as a result of our increased staffing level 
the increase in was primarily due to the higher weighted average grant date fair value of stock options expensed in compared to we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we prepare for the potential commercial launch of brentuximab vedotin and continue to establish our commercial infrastructure 
investment income  net investment income  net in thousands annual percentage change total investment income decreased to million in and to million in reflecting lower average yields on our investments  partially offset by higher average cash balances

to a lesser degree  we have also financed our operations through interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
these financing sources have historically allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and investment securities increased to million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  these increases reflect proceeds from the sale of common stock totaling million in  million in  and million in we used million in and million in to fund our operating activities

our working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we have structured our investment portfolio to provide working capital as needed 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments and subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in us government and agency securities  corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
as of december   we held auction rate securities valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to either a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  sale of the security in a secondary market or a negotiated or adjudicated resolution 
each of the securities continues to pay interest according to the stated terms on a monthly basis 
the interest rate on these auction rate securities is no longer established based on an auction process but is established according to the terms of the issue  which as of the date of this filing  is set at the day london interbank offering rate plus basis points 
based on our available cash  expected operating cash requirements and our belief that the holdings in auction rate securities will likely be liquidated in approximately one to three years at par  we believe it is more likely than not that we have the ability to hold  and we intend to hold  these investments until they recover substantially all of their cost basis 
this belief is based on our current assessment of our future operating plans and assessment of the individual securities and general market conditions 
we periodically reassess this conclusion based on several factors  including the continued failure of future auctions  failure of the investments to be redeemed  further deterioration of the credit rating of the investments  market risk and other factors 
any such future reassessment that results in a conclusion that the unrealized losses on these investments are other than temporary would result in a write down in the fair value of these investments 
such a write down would be recognized in our operating results 
these securities are valued based on unobservable inputs level as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements

our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated 
table of contents working capital needs 
however  if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term  or investments do not pay at maturity  we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities  which may result in a loss 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities are presented net of a cumulative million unrealized loss 
this amount represents the difference between our amortized cost and the fair market value of the investments and is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as of december   we had million held in cash reserves or debt securities scheduled to mature within the next twelve months 
in addition  in january  we received million in cash from our brentuximab vedotin collaboration with millennium and million in cash from our adc collaboration with gsk 
included in net cash used in investing activities in are capital expenditures related to the purchase of laboratory equipment in support of our research and development activities and for leasehold improvements 
we expect that our capital expenditures will be comparable to at our currently planned spending rate  we believe that our financial resources  in addition to the expected fees and milestone payments earned under our existing collaboration and license agreements  will be sufficient to fund our operations into at least changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner  such as increased manufacturing and clinical trial expenses and the expansion of our sales and marketing organization preceding commercialization of a product candidate 
additionally  we may not receive the fees and milestone payments that we currently expect under our existing collaboration and license agreements  including the brentuximab vedotin collaboration agreement with millennium  which may shorten the timeframe through which we are able to fund operations 
for example  in the event of a termination of the brentuximab vedotin collaboration agreement with millennium  we would not receive development cost sharing benefits  nor would we receive milestone payments or royalties for the development or sale of brentuximab vedotin 
in addition  as a result of the termination of the dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech  if we decide to continue development of dacetuzumab  we will be responsible for and will be required to solely fund any new dacetuzumab development and clinical trial activities undertaken after the effective date of the termination  which could result in a significant delay in the dacetuzumab development process 
if we determine instead to discontinue the development of dacetuzumab  we will not receive any future return on our investment from that product candidate 
we expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees and support our preclinical development  manufacturing and clinical trial activities  as well as position our product candidates  specifically brentuximab vedotin  for potential regulatory approval and commercial sale  and we will therefore continue to need significant amounts of additional capital 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements  public or private debt or equity financings 
however  the global credit markets and the financial services industry have recently experienced a period of unusual volatility and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the us government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
as a result of these recent events and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
we anticipate that our revenues will be in the range of million to million 
these revenues are expected to be generated from fees  milestones and reimbursements earned through our dacetuzumab  brentuximab vedotin and adc collaborations 
revenues are expected to include approximately million related to our dacetuzumab collaboration that will end in june  primarily driven by amounts previously received and included in deferred revenue that are expected to be recognized as revenue in the first half of 
table of contents total operating expenses are expected to be in the range of million to million 
operating expenses will be primarily directed towards brentuximab vedotin development and pre commercialization activities  as well as development and clinical activities for lintuzumab  sgn and asg me 
brentuximab vedotin development expenses incurred by us under the brentuximab vedotin collaboration with millennium will be recognized as expense as incurred 
millennium will co fund of the joint development costs incurred under the collaboration 
expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial 
included in our operating expense estimate are non cash amounts expected to be in the range of million to million  primarily attributable to share based compensation expense 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions  including future stock prices and the number and timing of option grants  and may therefore change 
we expect that our net cash used in operating activities for the year will be less than million  and that we will end with more than million in total cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments 
these amounts reflect up front payments totaling million that we received in january related to our collaboration agreements with millennium and gsk that were entered into in december certain external factors may influence our cash spending  including the cost of filing and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and the progress of our collaborators 
commitments some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay any royalties on net sales of products under any of these agreements unless and until we have a product approved for commercial sale 
the amounts set forth below for any given year could be substantially higher if we make certain development progress that requires us to make milestone payments or if we receive regulatory approvals or achieve commercial sales and are required to pay royalties 
the following are our future minimum contractual commitments for the periods subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license and other agreements total operating lease obligations do not assume the exercise by us of any termination or extension options 
the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements primarily represent contractual obligations related to performing scale up and gmp manufacturing for our product candidates for use in our clinical trials 
the above table excludes royalties and up to approximately million in potential future milestone payments to third parties under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements for our current development programs  which generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  clinical  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable with respect to timing  such contingent payments have not been included in the above table and will not be included until the event triggering such payment has occurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update entitled multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 

table of contents this standard prescribes the accounting treatment for arrangements that contain multiple deliverable elements and enables vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit in certain circumstances 
prior to this standard  only certain types of evidence were acceptable for determining the relative selling price of deliverables under an arrangement 
if that evidence was not available  the deliverables were treated as a single unit of accounting 
this updated standard expands the nature of evidence which may be used to determine the relative selling price of separate deliverables to include estimation 
this standard is applicable to arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted  however  if the standard is adopted early  and the period of adoption is not the beginning of our fiscal year  we would be required to apply the amendments retrospectively from the beginning of our fiscal year 
we have not yet adopted this standard or determined the impact of this standard on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
in accordance with our investment policy  we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high quality interest bearing instruments consisting of us government and agency securities  corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  auction rate securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
our investment securities consisted of the following in thousands december  short term investments long term investments other non current assets total included in long term investments as of december  are auction rate securities  valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to either a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  a sale of the security in a secondary market or a negotiated or adjudicated resolution 
given that further deterioration in the global credit and financial markets is a possibility  no assurance can be made that further downgrades  losses or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents  short term or long term investments will not occur 
if any such further downgrades  losses  or other significant deteriorations occur  it may negatively impact or impair our current portfolio of cash equivalents  short term or long term investments 
we have estimated the effect on our investment portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates by one percent to be a reduction of million in the fair value of our investments as of december  in addition  a hypothetical decrease of in the effective yield of our investments would reduce our expected investment income by approximately  in foreign currency risk all of our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in us dollars and as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date 
we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the fiscal year ended december   primarily related to contract manufacturing and ex us clinical trial activities  and we expect to continue to do so 
our primary exposure is to fluctuations in the euro and british pound 
we do not anticipate that foreign currency transaction gains or losses will be significant at our current level of operations 
however  transaction gains or losses may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations internationally 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging to date 
however  we may do so in the future
