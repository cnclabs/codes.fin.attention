if a wisconsin savings bank s capital ratio falls below the required level  the wdfi may direct the savings bank to adhere to a specific written plan established by the wdfi to correct the savings bank s capital deficiency  as well as a number of other restrictions on the s avings bank s operations  including a prohibition on the declaration of dividends 
at december   waterstone bank s capital to assets ratio  as calculated under wisconsin law  was federal law and regulation 
under fdic regulations  federally insured state chartered banks that are not members of the federal reserve system state non member banks  such as waterstone bank  are required to comply with minimum capital requirements 
for an institution determined by the fdic to not be anticipating or experiencing significant growth and to be  in general  a strong banking organization  rated composite under the uniform financial institutions ranking system established by the federal financial institutions examination council  the minimum tier i leverage capital to total assets ratio is 
for all other institutions  the minimum leverage capital ratio is not less than 
tier i leverage capital is the sum of common shareholders equity  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock including any related surplus and minority investments in certain subsidiaries  less intangible assets except for certain servicing rights and credit card relationships and certain other specified items 
the fdic regulations require state non member banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital in relation to regulatory risk weighted assets 
the ratio of regulatory capital to regulatory risk weighted assets is referred to as a bank s risk based capital ratio 
risk based capital ratios are determined by allocating assets and specified off balance sheet items including recourse obligations  direct credit substitutes and residual interests to four risk weighted categories ranging from to  with higher levels of capital being required for the categories perceived as representing greater risk 
for example  under the fdic s risk weighting system  cash and securities backed by the full faith and credit of the us government are given a r isk weight  loans secured by one to four family residential properties generally have a risk weight  and commercial loans have a risk weighting of 
state non member banks  such as waterstone bank  must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  of which at least one half must be tier i capital 
total capital consists of tier i capital plus tier or supplementary capital items  which include allowances for loan losses in an amount of up to of risk weighted assets  cumulative preferred stock and certain other capital instruments  and a portion of the net unrealized gain on equity securities 
the includable amount of tier capital cannot exceed the amount of the institution s tier i capital 
banks that engage in specified levels of trading activities are subject to adjustments in their risk based capital calculatio n to ensure the maintenance of sufficient capital to support market risk 
the fdic  along with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank s capital adequacy 
the fdic also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon a determination that an institution s capital level is  or is likely to become  inadequate in light of the particular circumstances

in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director  or principal shareholder 
prompt corrective regulatory action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act requires  among other things  that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  the statute establishes five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a bank shall be deemed to be i well capitalized if it has total risk based capital of or more  has a tier i risk based capital ratio of or more  has a tier i leverage capital ratio of or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive  ii adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier i risk based capital ratio of or more and a tier i leveraged capital ratio of or more under certain circumstance and does nto meet the definition of well capitalized  iii undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier i risk based capital ratio that is less than or a tier i leverage capital ratio that is less than under certain circumstances  iv significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier i risk based capital ratio that is less than  and v critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total asset s that is equal to or less than 
federal law and regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category except that the fdic may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized 
the federal deposit insurance corporation may order savings banks which have insufficient capital to take corrective actions 
for example  a savings bank which is categorized as undercapitalized would be subject to growth limitations and would be required to submit a capital restoration plan  and a holding company that controls such a savings bank would be required to guarantee that the savings bank complies with the restoration plan 
a significantly undercapitalized savings bank would be subject to additional restrictions 
savings banks deemed by the federal deposit insurance corporation to be critically undercapitalized would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator

pursuant to section o of the home owners loan act and office of thrift supervision regulations and policy  a mutual holding company  such as lamplighter financial  mhc and a federally chartered mid tier holding company  such as waterstone financial may engage in the following activities i investing in the stock of a savings bank  ii acquiring a mutual savings bank through the merger of such savin gs bank into a savings bank subsidiary of such holding company or an interim savings bank subsidiary of such holding company  iii merging with or acquiring another holding company  one of whose subsidiaries is a savings bank  iv investing in a corporation  the capital stock of which is available for purchase by a savings bank under federal law or under the law of any state where the subsidiary savings bank or savings banks share their home offices  v furnishing or performing management services for a savings bank subsidiary of such company  vi holding  managing or liquidating assets owned or acquired from a savings subsidiary of such company  vii holding or managing properties used or occupied by a savings bank subsidiary of such company  viii acting as trustee under deeds of trust  ix any other activity a that the federal reserve board  by regulation  has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies under section c of the bank holding company act of  unless the director  b y regulation  prohibits or limits any such activity for savings and loan holding companies  or b in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized by regulation to directly engage on march   x any activity permissible for financial holding companies under section k of the bank holding company act  including securities and insurance underwriting  and xi purchasing  holding  or disposing of stock acquired in connection with a qualified stock issuance if the purchase of such stock by such savings and loan holding company is approved by the director of the office of thrift supervision 
if a mutual holding company acquires or merges with another holding company  the holding company acquired or the holding company resulting from such merger or acquisition may only invest in assets and engage in activities listed in i through xi above  and has a period of two years to cease any nonconforming activities and divest of any nonconforming investments 
the home owners loan act prohibits a savings and loan holding company  including waterstone financial and lamplighter financial  mhc  directly or indirectly  or through one or more subsidiaries  from acquiring more than of another savings institution or holding company thereof  without prior written approval of the office of thrift supervision 
it also prohibits the acquisition or retention of  with certain exceptions  more than of a non subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the home owners loan act  or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured 
in evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions  the office of thrift supervision must consider the financial and managerial resources  future prospects of the company and institution involved  the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund  the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors 
the office of thrift supervision is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state  subject to two exceptions i the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies  and ii the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions 
waivers of dividends by lamplighter financial  mhc office of thrift supervision regulations require lamplighter financial  mhc to notify the office of thrift supervision of any proposed waiver of its receipt of dividends from waterstone financial 
the office of thrift supervision reviews dividend waiver notices on a case by case basis  and  in general  does not object to any such waiver if the waiver would not be detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the subsidiary savings bank  and the mutual holding company s board of directors determines that such waiver is consistent with such directors fiduciary duties to the mutual holding company s depositors 
we anticipate that lamplighter financial  mhc will waive any dividends paid by waterstone financial 
 as long as waterstone bank remains a wisconsin chartered savings bank  i any dividends waived by lamplighter financial  mhc must be retained by waterstone financial or waterstone bank and segregated  earmarked  or otherwise identified on the books and records of waterstone financial or waterstone bank  ii such amounts must be taken into account in any valuation of the institution  and factored into the calculation used in establishing a fair and reasonable basis for exchanging shares in any subsequent conversion of lamplighter financial  mhc to stock form  and iii such amounts shall not be available for payment to  or the value thereof transferred to  minority shareholders  by any means  including through dividend payments or at liquidation 

table of contents conversion of lamplighter financial  mhc to stock form office of thrift supervision regulations permit lamplighter financial  mhc to convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization a conversion transaction 
there can be no assurance when  if ever  a conversion transaction will occur  and the board of directors has no current intention or plan to undertake a conversion transaction 
in a conversion transaction a new holding company would be formed as the successor to waterstone financial the new holding company  lamplighter financial  mhc s corporate existence would end  and certain depositors of waterstone bank would receive the right to subscribe for shares of the new holding company 
in a convers ion transaction  each share of common stock held by shareholders other than lamplighter financial  mhc minority shareholders would be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock of the new holding company determined pursuant to an exchange ratio that ensures that minority shareholders own the same percentage of common stock in the new holding company as they owned in waterstone financial immediately prior to the conversion transaction subject to adjustment for any mutual holding company assets or waived dividends  as applicable 
the total number of shares of common stock held by minority shareholders after a conversion transaction also would be increased by any purchases by minority shareholders in the stock offering conducted as part of the conversion transaction 
any conversion transaction would require the approval of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of waterstone financial held by minority shareholders and by two thirds of the total outstanding shares of common stock of waterstone financial 
any conversion transaction also would require the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of depositors of lamplighter financial  mhc

federal and state taxation federal taxation general 
waterstone financial and subsidiaries and lamplighter financial  mhc are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations  with some exceptions discussed below 
waterstone financial and subsidiaries constitute an affiliated group of corporations and  therefore  are be eligible to report their income on a consolidated basis 
because lamplighter financial  mhc owns less than of the common stock of waterstone financial  it is not a member of that affiliated group and will report its income on a separate return 
the following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal inc ome tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to lamplighter financial  mhc  waterstone financial or waterstone bank 
method of accounting 
for federal income tax purposes  waterstone financial currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending december for filing its federal income tax returns 

table of contents bad debt reserves 
prior to the small business protection act of the act  waterstone bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve 
these additions could  within specified formula limits  be deducted in arriving at our taxable income 
as a result of the act  waterstone bank was required to use the specific charge off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its federal tax return 
savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of december  base year reserve 
at december   waterstone bank ha d no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year 
taxable distributions and recapture 
prior to the act  bad debt reserves created prior to january  were subject to recapture into taxable income if waterstone bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests 
federal legislation has eliminated these thrift related recapture rules 
at december   our total federal pre base year reserve was approximately million 
however  under current law  pre base year reserves remain subject to recapture if waterstone bank makes certain non dividend distributions  repurchases any of its stock  pays dividends in excess of tax earnings and profits  or ceases to maintain a bank charter 
alternative minimum tax 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  imposes an alternative minimum tax amt at a rate of on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences which we refer to as alternative minimum taxable income 
the amt is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of an exemption amount and the amt exceeds the regular income tax 
net operating losses can offset no more than of alternative minimum taxable income 
amt payments may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years 
due to a federal net operating loss carry back generated in  waterstone financial became subject to amt for and at december   the company had no such amounts available as credits for carryover 
net operating loss carryovers 
a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding taxable years 
a federal tax law change allows for a one time carry back of either or taxable losses for up to five years 
at december   waterstone bank had no net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
corporate dividends received deduction 
waterstone financial may exclude from its income of dividends received from waterstone bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations 
the corporate dividends received deduction is in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return  and corporations that own less than of the stock of a corporation distributing a dividend may deduct only of dividends received or accrued on their behalf 
state taxation wisconsin state taxation 
lamplighter financial  mhc and the company are subject to the wisconsin corporate franchise income tax 
under current law  the state of wisconsin imposes a corporate franchise tax of on the combined taxable incomes of the members of our consolidated income tax group 
prior to january   the income of the nevada subsidiary was only subject to taxation in nevada  which currently does not impose a corporate income or franchise tax 
in february  the wisconsin legislature passed legislation that requires combined state tax reporting effective january  this legislation results in the income of the nevada subsidiary being subject to the wisconsin corporate franchise tax of 
during the first quarter of  the company settled a dispute with the state of wisconsin regarding the operations of the company s investment subsidiary located in the state of nevada 
the settlement covered the nevada operations through the march  settlement date 
the settlement had no material effect on net income for the period as the full liability of million  including interest  net of deferred federal tax benefit of million  was accrued in prior periods 
the settlement had the effect of reducing the estimated effective tax rate for the year ended december  from the year ended december  as statutory interest no longer accrues as the liability has been settled 

table of contents item a 
risk factors the company operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to supervision  examination and enforcement action by various regulatory agencies 
as a savings bank holding company  the company is regulated by the office of thrift supervision  and the bank is regulated separately by various federal and state banking regulators 
this regulation is primarily intended to protect the bank s depositors rather than the company s shareholders 
in addition  the company s common stock is registered under the securities exchange act and it is subject to regulation by the securities and exchange commission and to public reporting requirements 
under applicable laws  the office of thrift supervision  the fdic  as the bank s primary federal regulator and deposit insurer  and the wisconsin department of financial institutions as the bank s chartering authority  have the ability to impose sanctions  restrictions and requirements on the company and on the bank if they determine  the bank or the company has violated laws or regulations or are not operating in a safe and sound manner 
banking regulators can take actions at any time that may have an adverse impact on the company and on the bank 
on november   bank agreed to a consent order issued by the wdfi and fdic and the company agreed to a cease and desist order issued by the ots  requiring among other things  the bank to maintain a minimum tier i capital ratio of  a minimum total risk based capital of  and prohibiting dividend payments without written regulatory approval 
as a result of the consent order the bank is subject to restrictions regarding the interest rates that it may offer on deposits 
specifically  it may not offer rates on deposits that exceed basis points above the national rate as calculated by the fdic 
as of december   the company and the bank were in compliance with all requirements of the regulatory orders issued 
noncompliance can result in more severe restrictions and civil money penalties 
complete copies of the regulatory orders were attached as exhibits to a form k filed with the sec on november  challenges posed by the weak economy and distressed real estate market 
the company is operating in a difficult and uncertain economic environment characterized by high unemployment rates  a weak real estate market and a weak economy 
as a result  capital raising alternatives  such as issuing common or preferred stock or borrowing funds at attractive rates are generally not available 
sales of either fixed assets or pools of loans to increase capital ratios may also have a negative impact on the company 
the economic recession and contraction of the local and national real estate markets have also resulted in higher provisions for loan losses and loan charge offs  and these same trends may also cause further valuation changes and losses in our loan and investment portfolios 
these conditions have reduced our capital levels and regulatory capital ratios over the past three years and may continue to do so in future periods 
changing interest rates may have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on our net interest income 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal reserve 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore our results of operations would be adversely affected 
earnings would also be adversely affected if the interest rate received on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on our deposits and borrowings 
although we believes that we have implemented effective asset and liability ma nagement strategies to reduce the adverse effects of changes in market interest rates on our results of operations  any substantial  unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
during we continued to experience high levels of delinquencies  non performing loans and charge offs 
during  we continued to experience high levels of non performing loans and loan delinquencies 
our non performing loans totaled million  or of total loans at december   compared to million  or of total loans at december  our loans past due totaled million  or of total loans receivable at december   compared to million  or of total loans at december  the continued high level of non performing and delinquent loans has resulted in high levels of loan charge offs 
during  net charge offs totaled million 
to the extent that our loan portfolio continues to deteriorate  our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
continued deterior ation could also lead to additional actions by regulators that could have a direct material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents if our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  our results of operation would be negatively impacted 
we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan portfolio  including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans 
in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  we analyze our loss and delinquency experience by loan categories and we consider the impact of existing economic conditions 
if the results of our analyses are incorrect  our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio  which would require additions to our allowance and would decrease our net income 
although we are unaware of any specific weaknesses in our loan portfolio that would require increases in our allowance at the present time  we may ne ed to increase our allowance further in the future due to credit deterioration  our emphasis on loan growth and on increasing our portfolio of commercial real estate loans 
in addition  bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge offs 
any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
continued deterioration of our investment portfolio could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the current sustained economic downturn has resulted in a decline in the value of our overall investment portfolio  including a decline in value of mortgage related securities which are dependent upon the performance of the underlying mortgages that provide the principal and interest cash flow for the securities 
similarly  growing states and municipality budget deficits resulting from declining tax revenues will result in related declines in the value of debt securities they have issued in prior years 
continued weakness or deterioration in general economic market conditions could result in future impairment losses on these securities or other investment securities 
if our investment in the federal home loan bank of chicago is classified as other than temporarily impaired  our earnings and stockholders equity could decrease 
we own common stock of the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlbc in order to qualify for membership in the federal home loan bank system and to be eligible to borrow funds under the fhlbc s advance program 
the fair value of our fhlbc common stock as of december  was million based on its cost 
there is no trading market for our fhlbc common stock 
certain member banks of the federal home loan bank system may be subject to accounting rules and asset quality risks that could result in materially lower regulatory capital levels 
in an extreme situation  it is possible that the capitalization of a federal home loan bank  including the fhlbc  could be substantially diminished or reduced to zero 
consequently  there is a risk that our investment in fhlbc common stock could be deemed other than temporarily impaired at some time in the future  and if this occurs  it would cause our earnings and stockholders equity to decrease by the after tax amount of any impairment charge 
our shareholders own a minority of waterstone financial common stock and are not able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of shareholders 
public shareholders own a minority of the outstanding shares of waterstone financial common stock 
as a result  public shareholders are not able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of shareholders 
lamplighter financial  mhc owns a majority of waterstone financial s common stock and  through its board of directors  is able to exercise voting control over most matters put to a vote of shareholders  including possible acquisitions 
the same directors who govern waterstone financial and waterstone bank also govern lamplighter financial  mhc 
the only matters which lamplighter financial  mhc is not able to exercise voting control are those requiring a separate vote of shareholders other than lamplighter financial  mhc 

table of contents our non interest expense will increase because of increases in fdic insurance premiums the fdic assesses premiums for deposit insurance on insured banks and savings banks 
this assessment is based on the risk category of the institution and currently ranges from to basis points of the institution s deposits 
federal law requires that the fdic establish a reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund at to of estimated insured deposits 
if this reserve ratio drops below or the fdic expects that it will do so within six months  the fdic must  within days  establish and implement a plan to restore the designated reserve ratio to of estimated insured deposits within five years absent extraordinary circumstances 
recent bank failures coupled with sustained weakness in the economy have significantly reduced the deposit insurance fund s reserve ratio 
the fdic imposed a basis point special assessment that was collected on september  on november   the fdic issued a rule pursuant to which all insured depository institutions are required to prepay their estimated assessments for the fourth quarter of  and for all of  and the prepayment was due on december  under the rule  the assessment rate for the fourth quarter of and for was based on each institution s total base assessment rate for the third quarter of  modified to assume that the assessment rate in effect on september  had been in effect for the entire third quarter  and the assessment rate for and was equal to the modified third quarter assessment rate plus an additional basis points 
in addition  each institution s base assessment rate for each period was calculated using its third quarter assessment base  adjusted quarterly for an estimated annual growth rate in the assessment base through the end of waterstone bank received a waiver from the fdic with respect to the  and insurance prepayment 
these actions significantly increased our non interest expense in  and will continue to increase non interest expense in future years as long as the fdic designated reserve ratio remains low

waterstone financial  inc became a publicly held corporation on october  waterstone financial has never paid cash dividends on its common stock  and our board currently has no plan to pay cash dividends on the common stock 
if the board considers a cash dividend in the future  the payment of dividends will depend upon a number of factors  including capital requirements  our financial condition and results of operations  tax considerations  statutory and regulatory limitations and general economic conditions and regulatory restrictions that affect our ability to pay dividends 
we cannot assure you that any dividends will be paid or that  if paid  they will not be reduced or eliminated in the future 
special cash or stock dividends  to the extent permitted by applicable policy and regulation  may be paid in addition to  or in lieu of  regular cash dividends

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of residential loans  construction loans and debt and mortgage related securities and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  consisting primarily of time deposits and borrowings from the fhlbc 
waterstone bank is primarily a mortgage lender with mortgage loans comprising of total loans receivable at december  further  of total loans receivable at december  were residential mortgage loans of which were one to four family residential mortgage loans and were over four family residential mortgage loans 
waterstone bank funds loan pr oduction primarily with retail deposits 
total deposits were of total assets on december  in addition  of total deposits were time deposits also known as certificates of deposit 
deposits obtained from brokers totaled million at december  waterstone bank uses borrowings from the fhlbc as a secondary source of funding 
fhlbc advances outstanding at december  totaled million or of total assets 
our results of operations also are significantly affected by our provision for loan losses  non interest income and non interest expense 
during the past three years  the significant provision for loan losses has had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
non interest income currently consists of mortgage banking income  service fees  income from the increase on the cash surrender value of life insurance and miscellaneous other income  partially offset by impairment losses on securities 
non interest expense currently consists of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy  real estate owned expense  data processing  advertising  professional fees and other operating expenses including fdic insurance premiums 
our results of operations are also affected by general and local econ omic and competitive conditions  changes in market interest rates  governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
allowance for loan losses 
waterstone bank establishes valuation allowances on loans deemed to be impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that waterstone bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the present value of the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral 
waterstone bank also establishes valuation allowances based on an evaluation of the various risk components that are inherent in the credit portfolio 
the risk components that are evaluated include past loan loss experience  the level of non performing and classified assets  current economic conditions  volume  growth  and composition of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  regulatory guidance  and other relevant factors 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and recoveries of previously charged off loans and reduced by charge offs 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved quarterly by the waterstone bank board of directors 
the allowance reflects management s best estima te of the amount needed to provide for the probable loss on impaired loans and other inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and is based on a risk model developed and implemented by management and approved by the waterstone bank board of directors 

table of contents actual results could differ from this estimate  and future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions 
in addition  state and federal regulators periodically review the waterstone bank allowance for loan losses 
such regulators have the authority to require waterstone bank to recognize additions to the allowance at the time of their examination 
if the allowance for loan losses is too low we may incur higher provisions for loan losses in the future resulting in lower net income or a net loss 
if an estimate of the allowance for loan losses is too high  we may experience lower provisions for loan losses resulting in higher net income 
income taxes 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements  rather than amounts reported on the income tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enac ted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
during  the company recorded net income tax expense of million which included million of additional income tax expense to establish a valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax asset 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence of taxes paid in availabl e carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods 
examples of negative evidence may include cumulative losses in a current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at both december  and  the company determined a valuation allowance was necessary  largely based on the negative evidence represented by a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused by the significant loan loss provisions recorded during those three years 
in addition  general uncertainty regarding the economy and the housing market has increased the potential volatility and uncertainty of projected earnings 
management is required to re evaluate the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance quarterly 
positions taken in the company s tax returns are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the income statement 
during the first quarter of  the company settled a dispute with the state of wisconsin regarding the operations of the company s investment subsidiary located in the state of nevada 
the settlement covered the nevada operations through the march  settlement date 
the settlement had no material effect on net income for the year ended december  as the full liability of million  including interest  net of deferred federal tax benefit of million  was accrued in prior periods 
management believes the company s tax policies and practices are critical because the determination of the tax provision and current and deferred tax assets and liabilities have a material impact on our net income and the carrying value of our assets 
we have no plans to change the tax recognition methodology in the future 
if the estimated valuation allowance against our deferred asset is adjusted it will affect our future net income 
at of december   there was a valuation allowance of million 
at december   the valuation allowance was million 
the net recorded deferred tax asset  after valuation allowance was million at december  and million at december  the remaining net deferred tax assets at december  and were primarily supported by available tax planning strategies 
the deferred tax asset at december  was partially supported by taxes paid in prior years recoverable by carry back 

table of contents comparison of financial condition at december  and at december total assets 
total assets decreased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total assets resulted primarily from a million decrease in loans receivable  partially offset by increases in cash and cash equivalents of million  securities available for sale and held to maturity of million  loans held for sale of million and real estate owned of million 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects the company s decision to maintain higher than usual liquidity in the current weak economic environment and relatively low rates of return available on securities and other investments 
securities available for sale 
securities available for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in the available for sale portfolio resulted from an increase in debt securities such as government agency and municipal securities 
the million increase in securities available for sale consisted of the reinvestment of million of earnings related to securities  a million reduction in the net unrealized loss and million of securities held to maturity reinvested in securities available for sale 
debt securities increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in debt securities was partially offset by a million decrease in mortgage related securities to million at december  from million as of december  the shift in the composition of the securities portfolio towards less volatile  shorter term debt securities reflects a decision to increase portfolio liquidity 
during the year ended december   the company identified two available for sale securities with a total december  fair value of million that was determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
as a result of the company s analysis  a million impairment has been recognized as of december   with respect to this security 
of the total impairment on this security  million has been identified as a credit loss and has been recognized as a current year expense

this fhlbc advance matured and was paid off in january of other liabilities 
other liabilities decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease resulted from a million decrease in capital lease obligations and a million decrease in accrued interest payable on deposits partially offset by a million increase in accrued fdic insurance premiums 
the decrease in the capital lease obligation resulted from the company s execution of a purchase option on its capital lease on a branch location during march the decrease in accrued interest payable on deposits resulted from a decrease in the weighted average cost of funds on time deposits for the year ended december  as compa red to the year ended december  combined with a decline in average outstanding balances 
the increase in accrued fdic insurance premiums is partially attributable to general fdic rate increases and an additional risk premium assessed on waterstone bank in particular

net loss for the year ended december  totaled million  or for both basic and diluted earnings per share compared to net income of million  or for both basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the year ended december  generated an annualized loss on average assets of and an annualized loss on average equity of  compared to annualized return of and  respectively  for the year ended december  the net loss was primarily due to a million increase in our provision for loan losses 
throughout the year  the company received updated appraisals on properties that collateralize non performing loans 
the decl ine in value noted in the appraisals  in addition to the continued downturn in the real estate market prompted the company to reevaluate the assumptions used to determine the fair value of collateral related to additional non performing loans 
due to continued deterioration in the loan portfolio and underlying collateral  the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million during the year ended december  the increase in the provision for loan losses was compounded by a  decrease in noninterest income  a million increase in noninterest expense and million increase in income tax expense  partially offset by a million increase in net interest income

loan charge off activity and specific loan reserves are discussed in additional detail in the asset quality section beginning on p age the net interest margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  during  the company recorded deferred income tax expense of million related to net deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods  while negative evidence includes the cumulative losses in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at december   the company determined a valuation allowance was necessary  largely based on the negative evidence represented by a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused by the significant loan loss provisions recorded during in addition  general uncertainty surrounding future economic and business conditions have increased the potential volatility and uncertainty of projected earnings 
management is required to re evaluate the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance quarterly 
the benefit may still be realized in the future  depending on a number of factors including future taxable income

we sold  in available for sale debt and mortgage related securities during the year ended december  there were no securities sold during the years ended december  and deposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates  market conditions and products offered by local competitors and other factors 
the net decrease in deposits was million during the year ended december  this compares to a net increase in deposits of million for the year ended december  and a net decrease in deposits of million during the year ended december  liquidity management is both a daily and longer term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlbc  which provide an additional source of funds 
at december   we had million in fixed rate advances from the fhlbc  of which million was due within months  and an additional available borrowing limit of million based on collateral requirements of the fhlbc 
at december   we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and unfunded commitments under construction loans  lines of credit and standby letters of credit of million 
at december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled million 
based on prior experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us  we will have to utilize other funding sources  such as fhlbc advances to maintain our level of assets 
however  such borrowings may not be available on attractive terms  or at all  if and when needed 
alternatively  we would reduce our level of liquid assets  such as our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale in order to meet funding needs 
in addition  the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal

impact of recent accounting pronouncements in the first quarter  the company elected to early adopt new guidance impacting asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  related to determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
this new guidance requires an assessment of whether certain factors exist to indicate that the market for an instrument is not active at the measurement date 
if  after evaluating those factors  the evidence indicates the market is not active  the company must determine whether recent quoted transaction prices are associated with distressed transactions 
if the company concludes that the quoted prices are associated with distressed transactions  an adjustment to the quoted prices may be necessary or the company may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple techniques may be appropriate to estimate an instrument s fair value 
the adoption did not have an impact on financial position  results of operation or liquidity 
for further information about fair value measurements  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in the first quarter  the company elected to early adopt new guidance impacting asc topic  financial instruments  related to interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this new guidance requires that disclosures on the estimated fair value of financial instruments be included in interim financial statements 
it also requires disclosure of the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments in the interim financial statements 
the adoption did not have an impact on financial position  results of operation or liquidity 

table of contents in the first quarter  the company elected to early adopt new guidance impacting asc topic  investments debt and equity instruments  related to recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments 
this new guidance changed the method for determining whether otti exists for debt securities by requiring an assessment of the likelihood of selling the security prior to recovering its amortized cost basis 
it also changed the amount of an impairment charge to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
if the company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  the security would be written down to fair value with the full amo unt of any impairment charge recorded as a loss in net securities gains losses in the consolidated statements of income 
if the company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the company will not be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  only the credit component of any impairment of a debt security would be recognized as a loss in net securities gains losses in the consolidated statements of income  with the remaining impairment recorded in oci 
the adoption did not have an impact on financial position  results of operation or liquidity 
on january   the company adopted new guidance impacting asc topic  earnings per share  related to determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
the guidance clarified that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and should be included in the calculation of basic earnings per share using the two class method and was applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented 
the adoption had no impact on the year ended december  and basic and diluted net income per common share 
for further earnings per share information  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
during the second quarter  the company adopted guidance impacting asc topic  subsequent events 
the objective of the guidance is to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date  but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the adoption did not have an impact on financial position  results of operation or liquidity 
in june  the fasb issued asc topic  accounting for transfers of financial assets 
the standard removes the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity from asc topic  transfers and servicing  and eliminates the exception for qualifying special purpose entities from consolidation guidance 
in addition  the standard establishes specific conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale 
if the transfer does not meet established sale conditions  the transferor and transferee must account for the transfer as a secured borrowing 
an enterprise that continues to transfer portions of a financial asset that do not meet the established sale conditions would be eligible to record a sale only after it has transferred all of its interest in that asset 
the effe ctive date is fiscal years beginning after november  accordingly  the company will adopt the provisions in the first quarter the company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions 
also  in june  the fasb issued asu n  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting for enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
the standard replaces the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the variable interest entity with a qualitative approach focused on identifying which enterprise has both the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entity 
in addition  the standard requires reconsideration of whether an entity is a variable interest entit y when any changes in facts and circumstances occur such that the holders of the equity investment at risk  as a group  lose the power from voting rights or similar rights of those investments to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
it also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and additional disclosures about an enterprise s involvement in variable interest entities 
the effective date is fiscal years beginning after november  accordingly  the company will adopt the provisions in the first quarter the company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions 

table of contents in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
asu  which provides amendments to asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
asu provides clarification that in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available  a reporting entity is required to measure fair value using one or more of the following techniques a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or a quoted price for a similar liability when traded as an asset  or another valuation method that is consistent with the principles of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
asu also provides clarification that when estimatin g the fair value of a liability  a reporting entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustments to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of the liability 
this statement is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period ending after december  the company adopted the accounting standard in the fourth quarter of the adoption of this accounting standard  had no material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes of waterstone bank have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  waterstone bank s board of directors ha s established an asset liability committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset liability committee meets at least weekly to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which are evaluated quarterly 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
we have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i emphasizing variable rate loans including variable rate one to four family  and commercial real estate loans as well as three to five year commercial real estate balloon loans  ii reducing and shortening the expected average life of the investment portfolio  and iii whenever possible  lengthening the term structure of our deposit base and our borrowings from the fhlbc 
these measures should reduce the volatility of our net interest income in different interest rate environments 
income simulation 
simulation analysis is an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
at least quarterly we review the potential effect changes in interest rates may have on the repayment or repricing of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
our most recent simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rate assumptions may have a significant impact on interest income simulation results 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortga ge backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates may have a significant impact on the actual prepayment speeds of our mortgage related assets that may in turn affect our interest rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayment speeds slow and the average expected lives of our assets would tend to lengthen more than the expected average lives of our liabilities and therefore would most likely have a negative impact on net interest income and earnings 
percentage increase decrease in estimated net annual interest income over months basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual decline in rates basis point gradual decline in rates basis point gradual decline in rates waterstone bank s asset liability policy limits projected changes in net average annual interest income to a maximum decline of for various levels of interest rate changes measured over a month period when compared to the flat rate scenario 
in addition  projected changes in the economic value of equity are limited to a maximum decline of to for interest rate movements of to basis points when compared to the flat rate scenario 
these limits are re evaluated on a periodic basis and may be modified  as appropriate 
because our balance sheet is liability sensitive  net interest income is projected to decline as interest rates rise 
however  due to the historically low short term current interest rate environment and related low cost of deposits  significant declines in interest rates do not result in a proportionate decline in the cost of deposits even though deposit liabilities reprice slightly faster than do loans 
at december   a basis point gradual increase in interest rates had the effect of increasing forecast net interest income by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of increasing net interest income by 
at december   a basis point gradual increase in interest rates had the effect of reducing the economic value of equity by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of increasing the economic value of equity by 
while we believe the assumptions used are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity
