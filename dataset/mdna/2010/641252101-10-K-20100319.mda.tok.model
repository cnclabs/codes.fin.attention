item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel pain management therapies 
we are assembling a portfolio of pain management product candidates based on known chemical entities to develop innovative new therapies that we believe may offer substantial advantages over currently available treatment options 
our initial focus is on the management of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain conditions 
our first commercial product  qutenza  the first prescription strength capsaicin product is a dermal delivery system designed to treat certain neuropathic pain conditions and was approved by the fda in november for the management of neuropathic pain associated with phn 
we are currently preparing to commercialize qutenza in the united states with our own sales force and we believe that qutenza will be commercially available in the united states in the first half of in may  qutenza received an ma  in the european union for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non diabetic adults  either alone or in combination with other medicinal products for pain 
in june  we entered into the astellas agreement  with astellas 
or astellas under which astellas was granted an exclusive license to commercialize qutenza in the licensed territory 
astellas has advised us that it is their goal to launch qutenza as soon as possible  with the aim to make qutenza available in as many of the eu markets as possible before the end of it is anticipated that selected countries will make qutenza available in the coming weeks following the date of this filing 
we are currently evaluating the nature  scope and timing of continued development of qutenza to support the potential for label expansion in the united states 
areas of potential focus for label expansion include hiv distal sensory neuropathy  or hiv dsp  also known as hiv associated neuropathy  or hiv an  painful diabetic neuropathy  or pdn  and potentially other neuropathic pain indications 
our plans for continued qutenza development efforts are being evaluated in light of astellas plans for market support studies and satisfaction of the european medicines agency  or emea  post approval regulatory commitments 
in addition to potential continued development of qutenza  we have an early stage development pipeline which consists of ngx  a topical liquid formulation of capsaicin for potential use in neuropathic pain conditions  ngx  ngx and ngx  prodrugs of acetaminophen for potential use in acute pain  including traumatic pain  post surgical pain and fever  and ngx  an opioid prodrug for potential use in chronic pain indications 
ngx has been evaluated in three phase studies and we currently anticipate re initiating our development of this product candidate in the other product candidates are in the pre clinical stage of development and may or may not be the subject of further development in or beyond 
further  we are currently seeking development partners for our acetaminophen and opioid prodrug product candidates 
to date we have not generated any significant revenues and have funded our operations primarily by selling equity securities  establishing debt facilities and through a collaboration agreement with astellas 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million at december  and during the twelve months ended december   we used million in operating activities after adjusting for cash inflows from the astellas agreement 
we expect to continue to incur annual operating losses over the next several years and those losses will likely increase in the 
table of contents near term as we continue our efforts to commercialize qutenza in the united states 
additionally  we expect to resume development of ngx and potentially our other product candidates 
with respect to our notes payable  the outstanding balance at december  was million and it is has been fully repaid as of january critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we entered into the astellas agreement in june of  which grants astellas an exclusive license to promote  distribute and market qutenza in the licensed territory  grants an option to exclusively license ngx a non patch liquid formulation of capsaicin in the licensed territory  obligates us to participate on a joint steering committee and through a related supply agreement entered into along with the astellas agreement and requires us to supply qutenza components to astellas until direct supply arrangements are established between astellas and the manufacturers of such components 
revenue under this arrangement includes upfront non refundable fees and may also include further option payments for the development of and license to ngx  milestone payments upon achievement of certain product sales levels  as well as royalties on product sales 
we view the astellas agreement and related agreements as a multiple element arrangement with the key elements consisting of an exclusive license to qutenza in the licensed territory  an obligation to conduct certain development activities associated with ngx  participation on a joint steering committee  and supply of qutenza components to astellas until such time that astellas can establish a direct supply relationship with product vendors  which we anticipate may occur between to months from the execution of the astellas agreement 
because not all of these elements have both standalone value and objective and reliable evidence of fair value  we are accounting for them as a single unit of accounting in accordance with codification topic  multiple element arrangements 
further  as the astellas agreement provides for a joint steering committee and we believe that our involvement in that committee is a substantive performance obligation under the arrangement  we plan to recognize revenue associated with upfront payments and future license fees related to ngx  if any  ratably over the term of the performance obligations with respect to the joint steering committee  which we estimate to be the last delivered item in the arrangement 
we have estimated this performance obligation to be delivered ratably through june at the inception of the arrangement  the upfront license fees were subject to a refund right  which expired upon transfer of our ma for qutenza in the european union to astellas 
the transfer of the qutenza ma to astellas was completed  and revenue recognition of the upfront license fee commenced in september research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses include personnel and personnel related costs  costs associated with pre clinical and clinical development activities  such as clinical trials  including amounts paid to clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  
table of contents product and manufacturing costs such as process development  clinical product supply costs and the cost of commercially saleable product that is manufactured prior to market approval for that product candidate  internal and external costs associated with our regulatory compliance and quality assurance functions including the costs of outside consultants and contractors that assist in the process of submitting and maintaining regulatory filings  and overhead costs including allocated facility and related expenses 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of current authoritative guidance using the prospective transition method 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after december  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of current authoritative guidance 
under topic  compensation stock compensation  or topic  stock based awards  including stock options  are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized to expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period  which we have elected to amortize on a straight line basis 
because non cash stock compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced by an estimate for future forfeitures 
topic requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions used shown in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
significant judgment is required on the part of management in determining the proper assumptions used in this model 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation model include the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and expected dividend yield 
we base our assumptions on historical data where available or when not available  on a peer group of companies 
however  these assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions  which are inherently uncertain  and therefore subject to management s judgment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail 
inventory inventories are determined at the lower of cost or market value with cost determined under the specific identification method 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
raw materials include the active pharmaceutical ingredient for a product to be manufactured  work in process includes the bulk inventory of qutenza patch and cleansing gel that are in the process of being manufactured or have completed manufacture and are awaiting final packaging  including related internal labor and overhead costs and finished goods include the final packaged kits that contain the qutenza patch and cleansing gel and that are ready for commercial sale 
at december   the inventory amount was not material and was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets 
clinical trials we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties  including clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  based upon estimates made  as of the reporting date  of the work completed through the reporting date as a percentage of the total work contracted for under our agreements with such third parties 
we make our estimates at the end of each reporting period after discussion with internal personnel and outside service providers and thorough evaluation as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services  as of the end of each reporting period 
on a periodic basis we adjust our estimated clinical trial costs to reflect actual expenses incurred to date 
due to the nature of the estimation of clinical trial costs  we may be required to make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of clinical trials 

table of contents results of operations in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  we commenced recording revenue for the upfront payments from astellas when such payments became nonrefundable 
in the twelve months ended december   the upfront payment of million received from astellas became nonrefundable as a result of our transfer of the qutenza ma to astellas in september  and accordingly  in the twelve months ended december  we recorded million of collaboration revenue 
the remaining upfront payment will be recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining service period of the joint steering committee  which we estimate will expire in june under our supply agreement with astellas  we are obligated to supply product  at our cost  until such time as astellas establishes its own supply relationship with suppliers 
astellas has advised us that it is their goal to launch qutenza as soon as possible  with the aim to make qutenza available in as many of the eu markets as possible before the end of it is anticipated that selected countries will make qutenza available in the coming weeks following the date of this filing 
upon the expected launch of qutenza by astellas  we expect to commence recording royalty revenue based upon astellas net sales of qutenza in the astellas territory 
the timing of recording royalty revenue from astellas may lag by as much as a quarter due to timing of astellas reporting such royalties to us 
our research and development expenses consist of internal and external costs 
our internal costs are primarily employee salaries and benefits  contract employee expense  non cash stock compensation expense  allocated facility and other overhead costs 
our external costs are primarily expenses related to the development of product candidates including formulation development  manufacturing process development  non clinical studies  clinical trial costs  such as the cost of clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  milestone payments to our licensors in connection with the use of certain intellectual property  and costs associated with preparation and filing of regulatory submissions 
additionally  external and internal costs related to manufacturing and quality assurance activities for production batches of our active pharmaceutical ingredient  patches and cleansing gel  which are destined for commercial sale in the united states  were recorded to research and development expense if purchase of such components occurred prior to fda approval 
in the years ended december   and  our external research and development costs totaled million  million and million  respectively  and of these amounts  and  respectively  were incurred in programs related to qutenza 
we commence tracking the separate  external costs of a project when we determine that a project has a reasonable chance of entering clinical development 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects and many resources may not attributable to specific projects 
however  to the extent possible  we account for our internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
over time  we believe that our internal costs are expended on our development projects generally in proportion to our external development costs for such project relative to total external development costs 
the process of conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials necessary to obtain marketing approvals in the united states and other regions is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  patient enrollment  manufacturing capabilities  successful clinical results  our funding  and competitive and commercial viability 
as a result of these and other factors  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when or to what extent we will generate revenues from commercialization and sale of any of our unapproved product candidates 
currently we are planning the entry into phase of ngx ngx is our most advanced product candidate and costs to complete development for this program could be significant 
pursuant to our license agreement with astellas  we might receive future option payments related to this program at astellas election 
further  if astellas exercises its option to license ngx  astellas would be responsible for of the costs incurred for phase clinical development 
we anticipate that our overall research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expense  may increase beginning in with the majority of that increase expected to occur in 
table of contents the second half of as we currently expect to resume development activities for ngx and potentially one or more of our other development programs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  including those of our sales  marketing  commercial operations and administrative functions such as finance  human resource  legal  medical affairs and information technology 
additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses include marketing expenses  commercialization costs  pharmacovigilance costs and costs associated with our status as a public company and patent costs 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include allocated facility  basic operational and support costs and insurance costs 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase significantly during and over the next several years as a result of our anticipated commercialization of qutenza in the first half of these increases are likely to be attributable to increasing marketing activities  the costs of hiring and deploying a sales force in the united states and infrastructure costs to support commercial operations  and the costs of being a public company  as well as the need to add additional personnel in all of the key functional areas that support growth of our general operations  including accounting and finance  legal and human resources 
comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except percentages collaboration revenue research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue of million recorded in the year ended december  consisted primarily of million attributed to the amortization of upfront payments received pursuant to the astellas agreement 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in our lower spending in research and development reflects our decision to focus our cash and human resources on those activities directly in support of gaining marketing approval for qutenza in the united states and the european union as well as certain limited pre commercialization activities 
specifically  the decrease was attributable to a million decrease in clinical study costs as we completed the phase clinical program which supported our nda filing in  a million decrease in employee related costs commensurate with our reduced clinical trial activity  a million decrease in spending related to ngx and our earlier stage product candidates as these programs were deferred to preserve cash resources  a million reduction in regulatory expenses associated with the preparation and submission of our nda in and support for our marketing authorization application with the emea  a million decrease in quality assurance costs associated with clinical trial activity in  a million decrease associated with the capitalization of employee related costs attributable to the manufacture of commercial product for sale in both the astellas licensed territory and the united states  and a million decrease in manufacturing related costs 
these decreases were partially offset by a million charge representing the sublicense fee payable to the university of california in connection with the receipt of upfront payments from astellas under the astellas agreement as well as a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was due to a million increase in non cash stock based compensation 
table of contents expense primarily associated with the grant of fully vested stock options to certain of our officers and a million increase in selling  general and administrative employee related expenses as a result of an increase in staffing in support of commercialization activities including the establishment of a medical affairs function 
also contributing to the year over year change was a million increase in costs associated with work to support our pricing and reimbursement strategies 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to less than million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this change was primarily attributable to a decline in the prevailing interest rates  o in general  and lower rates obtained as we moved our invested assets to those with lower relative risk in light of events in the credit markets 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in this decrease was related to the reduction in the outstanding principal balance of notes payable as a result of the scheduled payoff and repayment of principal on the remaining outstanding notes payable 
comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense other income expense  net research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was attributable to  in part  a decision to reduce our non clinical and clinical development expenses related both to potential label expansion of qutenza as well as our other product candidate programs 
this was due to our desire to preserve cash resources to support our regulatory submissions processes in both the united states and the european union and to devote resources to certain pre commercialization activities 
specifically  our research and development expenses declined as a result of a million decrease in clinical study related costs associated with qutenza 
during  we were conducting two phase clinical trials  whereas we completed our most recent phase clinical trial in the first half of also contributing to the year over year change was a million decrease related to manufacturing costs in support of qutenza 
in  our manufacturing costs were primarily attributed to manufacturing development activities including validation of our active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  manufacturing processes to support our maa submission in the third quarter of and manufacturing costs associated with support of our two phase clinical trials  whereas in there was a lower level of activity in these areas 
additionally  there was a million decrease in external regulatory expenses resulting from the recognition of our qutenza marketing authorization application for qutenza in the european union  or maa filing fees in the third quarter of additional decreases included a million reduction in spending related to ngx  which was primarily driven by the completion of ind enabling non clinical toxicology studies in  a reduction in external quality assurance costs as a result of a lower level of clinical trial activity in and a million reduction in non cash stock based compensation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in spending related to our manufacturing support infrastructure and increased staffing within the regulatory and quality assurance functions to support our regulatory submissions and prepare for commercial launch of qutenza 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was due to a million increase in spending for pre commercialization activities 
table of contents such as medical education  marketing materials development and work in support of our pricing and reimbursement strategies 
also contributing to the year over year change was a million increase in general and administrative and marketing employee related expenses as a result of an increase in staffing in support of being a public company and in support of pre commercialization activities and a million increase in allocated overhead costs related to the move of our corporate headquarters to san mateo  california in october other increases were due to the costs of being a public company  including a million increase in directors and officers insurance expense  professional fees and other public company costs 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the rate of return on our invested assets as rates declined in the market  in general  and as we moved our invested assets to investments of lower relative risk in light of events in the credit markets 
the decrease in our interest income was somewhat limited due to the fact that we had a higher average investment balance during as compared to interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was related to the reduction in the outstanding principal balance of notes payable as a result of the scheduled repayment of principal on those notes payable 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased million to less than million in expense in from million in income in the other income amount of million in the period was attributable to a decline in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability 
due to the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into common stock in connection with our ipo in the second quarter of  these warrants became exercisable for common stock  were reclassified to stockholders equity and are no longer required to be recorded at fair value at each reporting date 
we performed a final remeasurement in the period ended june  and have ceased to record any further periodic fair value adjustments 
accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock our redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding prior to our initial public offering was redeemable at the request of the holders on or after june  we accreted the carrying value of the preferred stock issuances to the redemption amount using the effective interest method through periodic charges to additional paid in capital 
upon completion of our initial public offering on may   our preferred stock converted to common stock and the carrying value of our preferred stock was reclassified to common stock and additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception through december   we have funded our operations primarily by selling equity securities  establishing debt facilities and through a collaboration agreement with astellas 
on may   we completed an initial public offering of our common stock which resulted in net cash proceeds  after deducting total expenses including underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering related expenses  of approximately million 
on december  we completed the first closing of a private placement of our common stock and warrants resulting in net cash proceeds of million and on january   we completed the second and final closing of this private placement of our common stock and warrants resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we also had working capital  adjusted to exclude the current portion of non cash deferred revenue of approximately million  of million 
our cash and investment balances are typically held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including corporate bonds  commercial paper  money market funds and obligations of us government agencies 
cash in excess of immediate operational requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to capital preservation and liquidity 
further  to 
table of contents reduce portfolio risk  our investment policy specifies a concentration limit of in any one issuer or group of issuers of corporate bonds or commercial paper at the time of purchase 
our investment holdings at december  consist solely of us treasury or money market funds consisting of only us treasury securities 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in and net cash used in operating activities was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in and consisted of external research and development expenses  internal personnel costs associated with our research and development programs and infrastructure costs supporting our research and development activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily a result of the receipt of an upfront payment under the astellas agreement  partially offset by our net loss during the period 
included in net cash provided by and used in operating activities are net changes in assets and liabilities affecting cash 
after adjusting for the affects of the astellas payment  our net cash used in operating activities would have been approximately million in  which was significantly lower than our net cash used in operations in and this decrease was a direct result of our decision in to limit our spending on research and development activities in order to focus resources on supporting our regulatory processes in both the united states and the european union and to certain pre commercialization activities 
we anticipate that cash used in operating activities will likely increase in as a result of our commercialization activities to support the launch of qutenza in the united states as well as due to the potential resumption of activities associated with the ngx development program 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in  net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in and net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase  sale and maturity of marketable securities and to a lesser extent  the purchase of capital equipment 
fluctuations in our investing activities have primarily been driven by the timing and receipt of proceeds from financing activities and the upfront payments from astellas 
we expect that property and equipment expenditures will increase in due to the capital needs for infrastructure to support our commercial operations 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million and million in and  respectively and net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in financing activities in consisted primarily of the exercise of stock options and issuance of stock to employees pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  offset by principal repayments on our venture loan financing arrangements 
in addition to these activities  financing activities in also included the sale of our common stock and warrants in a private placement transaction 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of our ipo  a private placement of our common stock and warrants and the exercise of warrants underlying our preferred stock  partially offset by principal repayments on our venture loan financing arrangements 
contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following table represents our total contractual obligations  including principal and interest  at december   aggregated by type in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and thereafter operating lease obligations notes payable purchase obligations total represent our future minimum rental commitments for our noncancelable operating lease obligations for our facilities and office equipment 

table of contents represents the final payments under a venture loan agreement entered into in fiscal year consists of commitments to third party manufacturers of qutenza and ngx for manufacturing  stability and related services including reimbursable amounts from astellas for the supply of qutenza based on astellas agreement 
in addition to the above  we have commitments to pay royalties on certain patents we licensed from the university of california for prescription strength capsaicin for neuropathic pain 
under the terms of this license agreement we are required to pay royalties on net sales of the licensed product up to a maximum of  per annum as well as a percentage of upfront and milestone payments or resulting from sublicense of our rights under the agreement 
we also have commitments to pay royalties under a commercial supply and license agreement with lts to manufacture commercial and clinical supply of qutenza 
under the terms of the agreement  we are required to pay a transfer price for product purchased under the agreement as well as a royalty on net sales of product purchased under such agreement 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the success of the commercialization of our products  the costs of establishing sales and marketing infrastructure  distribution capabilities and a sales force  the scope and cost of commercial activities activities including  but not limited to  costs associated with pharmacovigilance and medical affairs activities  the conduct of manufacturing activities  the costs of carrying out our obligations under our commercial arrangement with astellas  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish  the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals  the progress of our development programs including the number  size and scope of clinical trials and non clinical development  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the balance of our notes payable totaled million 
during the twelve months ended december   after adjusting for the upfront fees collected from astellas  we used a total of million in operating activities 
we currently anticipate that our cash usage in will increase significantly from as a result of spending related to our commercialization and product launch activities for qutenza  and to a lesser extent as a result of the potential resumption of development activities related to ngx and potentially our other development programs 
we anticipate that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements beyond december  to date  we have incurred recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  if ever  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities and proceeds from one or more collaboration agreements as well as potentially through royalty monetization  debt financing or the sale of other equity securities 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining additional collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  
table of contents if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay or potentially eliminate some or all of our development programs  relinquish some or even all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or negotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect the launch of our product candidates or our ability to continue in business 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate and market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which have maturities of less than one year 
the goal of our investment policy is primarily liquidity and capital preservation while attempting to maximize the income we receive without assuming significant risk 
to achieve these objectives our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
further  to reduce portfolio risk through diversification  our investment policy specifies a concentration limit of in any one issuer or group of issuers of corporate bonds or commercial paper at the time of purchase 
our cash and investments as of december  consisted of us treasury securities and money market funds consisting of only us treasury securities 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates by basis points would not result in a material decrease in the fair value of our net investment position 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our third party manufacturers including the manufacturer of our active pharmaceutical ingredient  trans capsaicin  the manufacturer of qutenza and the manufacturer of our cleansing gel  are located in countries outside the united states 
as a result  we may experience changes in product supply costs as a result of changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency where the manufacturing activities occur 
in addition  as we oversee scale up to supply astellas with our product components for commercial sale in the european union and to supply the us market  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  will increase 
amounts paid to us by astellas under the astellas agreement may be based in euro or other currencies which will then be converted to us dollars before payment to us 
to the extent that these potential receipts are greater than our net payable exposure in euro to our suppliers mentioned above  and to the extent that the timing of these potential payments and receipts differ  we will have a net receivable exposure in euro once qutenza is launched in the european union and certain other foreign territories 
we currently do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities as the short term exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency is relatively small
