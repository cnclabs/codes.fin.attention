item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes  obesity and other diseases through the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative medicines 
we are marketing two first in class medicines to treat diabetes  byetta and symlin and we are currently seeking approval for exenatide once weekly  an investigational sustained release medication for type diabetes that is administered only once a week 
in  we executed on key opportunities for the company including gaining approval for an expanded indication of byetta as a first line  stand alone medication monotherapy along with diet and exercise  finalized byetta label updates  submitted an nda  for exenatide once weekly and executed our duration clinical program designed to demonstrate superiority of exenatide once weekly compared to other diabetes medications  completed two obesity clinical trials and entered into a collaboration to develop obesity therapies with takeda  and improved our operating results and believe we are on track to achieve our stated goal of becoming operating cash flow positive on a sustainable basis by the end of and achieving operating profitability by the end of byetta is the first approved medicine in a class of compounds called glp receptor agonists 
in october  the fda approved an expanded indication to include byetta as a first line  stand alone medication monotherapy along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type diabetes and changes to the byetta label to incorporate updated safety language 
previously byetta was approved as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with type diabetes who have not achieved adequate glycemic control by using metformin  a sulfonylurea and or a tzd  three common oral therapies for type diabetes 
we believe the expanded monotherapy indication and label update present new opportunities for the byetta brand 
net product sales of byetta were million in  million in and million in we have an agreement with lilly for the global development and commercialization of exenatide 
this agreement includes byetta and other formulations of exenatide such as exenatide once weekly 
under the terms of the agreement  operating profits from products sold in the united states are shared equally between lilly and us  and lilly will pay us royalties for product sales outside of the united states 
lilly has primary responsibility for developing and commercializing byetta outside of the united states  including any sustained release formulations of exenatide such as exenatide once weekly 
by the end of  byetta was commercially launched in approximately countries worldwide 
symlin is the first and only approved medicine in a class of compounds called amylinomimetics 
it is approved as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with either type or type diabetes who is treated with mealtime insulin but who have not achieved adequate glycemic control 
we own of the global rights to symlin and in we plan to explore partnering symlin outside of the united states 
net product sales of symlin were million in  million in and million in we have a field force of approximately people dedicated to marketing byetta and symlin in the united states 
our field force includes our specialty sales force and our managed care organization 
lilly co promotes byetta in the united states 
in may  we announced a restructuring of our sales force  a new sales approach within the diabetes market and merged our then existing primary care and specialty sales forces into a single organization that brings a specialty approach to endocrinologists and diabetes focused primary care physicians 
this new sales force is focused on targeting those doctors that write the majority of prescriptions for branded diabetes therapies 
the restructuring of our sales force reduced our total number of sales representatives by approximately in addition to our marketed products  we are working with lilly and alkermes to develop exenatide once weekly 
in may  we announced that we submitted an nda for exenatide once weekly to the fda 
the fda filed the nda submission in july and the application has a ten month review period 
clinical components of the nda included results from our duration study which tested the superiority of exenatide once weekly as compared to byetta and a meta analysis across controlled clinical studies of three months or greater from the byetta database which showed no increased risk of cardiovascular events associated with exenatide use 
components of the nda submission supporting product manufacturing included analyses of data from patients in our ongoing extension of the duration study who used exenatide once weekly produced at our ohio manufacturing facility to demonstrate comparability of the intended commercial product with that used during development 
the fda conducted a pre approval inspection of this facility and has made a number of observations which we believe are addressable 
in march and july  we announced positive results from duration and duration  respectively  the second and third in a series of six such studies designed to test the superiority of exenatide once weekly compared to other diabetes therapies 
in duration  exenatide once weekly demonstrated superior glucose control with weight loss and no increase in hypoglycemia compared to maximum doses of sitagliptin or pioglitazone 
in duration  exenatide once weekly demonstrated superior glucose control with weight loss and with less hypoglycemia compared to insulin glargine 
in december  we announced results from duration  a head to head study comparing exenatide once weekly to byetta 
in duration  patients taking exenatide once weekly experienced a statistically superior reduction in ac compared to byetta 
in  we will continue to focus on building a superior profile for exenatide once weekly by conducting additional clinical trials that will compare exenatide once weekly against competing products 
for example  we expect to report results from our duration study in comparing exenatide once weekly with metformin  sitagliptin or pioglitazone and we have initiated duration comparing exenatide once weekly with liraglutide 
in addition  we initiated our exscel study in the first quarter of  to demonstrate exenatide once weekly s effect on cardiovascular endpoints 
we plan to continue making strategic investments in the exenatide franchise including the development of an exenatide once weekly pen delivery system  an exenatide suspension formulation and potential noninvasive delivery systems including transdermal and nasal 
our long term growth strategy is focused on making prudent investment decisions based on strong clinical data to advance our obesity program and includes our integrated neurohormonal treatment of obesity  or into  strategy 
in october  we entered into a worldwide exclusive license  development and commercialization agreement with takeda to co develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of obesity and related indications 
the agreement includes products to be developed from our product pipeline  including pramlintide metreleptin  which are compounds currently in phase development for the treatment of obesity 
we recently announced results of a week phase study of this compound and  based on those results  we and takeda plan to advance pramlintide metreleptin toward phase development 
we maintain an active discovery research program focused on novel peptide and protein therapeutics 
we have also entered into a number of strategic alliances and business initiatives that support our expansion into new therapeutic areas 
since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs and  more recently  to the commercialization of our products 
all of our revenues prior to may were derived from milestones and amortization of up front payments under our exenatide collaboration agreement with lilly  previous symlin collaborative agreements  and previous co promotion agreements 
during the second quarter of  we began to derive revenues from product sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
additionally we have million available to us pursuant to a credit facility with lilly 
although we have yet to consistently generate positive operating cash flows  we intend to improve our operating results and reduce our use of cash for operating activities in order to achieve our goal to be operating cash flow positive on a sustainable basis by the end of and to achieve operating profitability by the end of refer to the discussions under the headings liquidity and capital resources below and cautionary factors that may affect future results in part i  item a for further discussion regarding our anticipated future capital requirements 
recent developments diabetes byetta received approval in october for the expanded indication of byetta injection as a first line  stand alone treatment monotherapy for type diabetes 
announced results from a meta analysis of cv events that showed no increased risk of cv events associated with byetta injection use compared to a pooled comparator group treated with either placebo or insulin 
exenatide once weekly announced results from the first head to head comparative effectiveness study  duration  that demonstrated exenatide once weekly provided superior glucose control  with weight loss  compared to maximum doses of januvia or actos r pioglitazone 
submitted an nda for exenatide once weekly 
the application was accepted for review by the fda in early july and the application has a ten month review period 
announced results from a second head to head comparative effectiveness study  duration  that demonstrated exenatide once weekly provided superior glucose control over lantus insulin glargine injection 
treatment with exenatide once weekly also led to statistically significant improvements in body weight  with reduced incidence of confirmed hypoglycemia 
signed a joint supply agreement with lilly to develop a pen device for exenatide weekly that will enable patients to mix and administer the medicine in a pre filled pen device  instead of the syringe and vial currently used in clinical trials 
communicated positive results from the duration study that showed exenatide once weekly provided superior glucose control compared to byetta 
symlin presented data that showed the use of mealtime symlin improved glucose control  treatment satisfaction and quality of life for patients with type diabetes 
obesity programs announced a worldwide exclusive license  development and commercialization agreement with takeda to co develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products for the treatment of obesity and related indications 
financial and operational merged amylin s existing primary care and specialty sales forces into a single organization that will bring a specialty approach to endocrinologists and diabetes focused primary care physicians  ultimately improving the quality and frequency of our interactions with core prescribers 
significantly improved operating results compared to and remain on track to achieve our stated goal of sustainable positive operating cash flows by the end of and operating profitability by the end of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory costs  research and development expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  license fees and milestones earned 
net product sales we sell byetta and symlin primarily to wholesale distributors  who in turn  sell to retail pharmacies and government entities 
decisions made by these wholesalers and their customers regarding the levels of inventory they hold  and thus the amount of byetta and symlin they purchase  may materially affect the level of our product sales in any particular period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when delivery has occurred  title has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and we have no further obligations 
we record product sales net of allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts and prescription vouchers 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
product returns we do not offer our wholesale customers a general right of return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are damaged or defective when received by the wholesale customer or for any unopened product during the period beginning six months prior to and up to months subsequent to its expiration date 
product returned is generally not resalable as our products require refrigeration 
we refund the sales price for product returns in cash or credit to our customers 
we estimate product returns based on our historical returns experience and record an allowance for estimated returns at the time of sale 
additionally  we consider several other factors in our estimation process including our internal sales forecasts  the expiration dates of product shipped and third party data to assist us in monitoring estimated channel inventory levels and prescription trends 
actual returns could exceed our historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns due to factors such as wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and inventory levels and or competitive changes 
to date actual returns have not differed materially from our estimates 
rebates and wholesaler chargebacks allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program and contracted discounts with commercial payors 
rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector eg medicaid benefit providers 
the allowance for rebates is based on contractual discount rates  expected utilization under each contract and our estimate of the amount of inventory in the distribution channel that will become subject to such rebates 
our estimates for expected utilization for rebates are based on historical rebate claims and to a lesser extent third party market research data 
rebates are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
we recorded an allowance related to the department of defense s dod tricare retail pharmacy program pursuant to a final rule that was issued in march and became effective on may  the final rule clarified the dod s interpretation of the national defense authorization act of  or ndaa  signed into law on january  the final rule changed the process by which rebate obligations for the tricare retail pharmacy program are created such that a contractual agreement is no longer required and that obligation to pay such rebates emanates from the ndaa itself 
wholesaler chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from an intermediary wholesale purchaser 
contracted customers  which currently consist primarily of federal government entities purchasing off the federal supply schedule  generally purchase the product at its contracted price  plus a mark up from the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler by the customer 
the allowance for wholesaler chargebacks is based on expected utilization of these programs and reported wholesaler inventory levels 
actual rebates and wholesaler chargebacks could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
to date  actual rebate claims and wholesaler chargebacks have not differed materially from our estimates 
wholesaler discounts wholesaler discounts consist of prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees 
we offer all of our wholesale customers a prompt pay discount within the first days after the date of the invoice 
distribution service fees arise from contractual agreements with certain of our wholesale customers for distribution services they provide to us and are generally a fixed percentage of their purchases of our products in a given period 
prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees are recorded as a reduction to gross sales in the period the sales occur 
the allowance for wholesaler discounts is based upon actual data of product sales to wholesale customers and not on estimates 
prescription vouchers prescription vouchers result in amounts owed to pharmacies that have redeemed vouchers for a free prescription 
we provide prescription vouchers to physicians  who in turn distribute them to patients 
patients may redeem a voucher at a pharmacy for a free prescription 
we reimburse the pharmacy for the price it paid the wholesaler for the medicine and record this reimbursement as a reduction to gross sales 
the allowance for prescription vouchers is based on the number of unredeemed vouchers in circulation  and the estimated utilization rate 
the estimated utilization rate is based on our historical utilization rates experience with prescription vouchers 
the allowance for prescription vouchers could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future utilization rates 
to date  actual prescription voucher utilization has not differed materially from our estimates 
revenues under collaborative agreements revenues under collaborative agreements consist of the amortization of product and technology license fees and milestone payments earned 
upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
non refundable amounts received for substantive milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
valuation of stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of non cash  stock based payments to employees 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payments to employees using the black scholes model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of inputs that require us to make significant estimates and judgments 
these inputs include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of employee stock options  the risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected forfeiture rate 
we estimate volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected term of our employee stock options and the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock with various maturities between six months and two years 
the determination to use implied volatility in addition to historical volatility was based upon the availability of data related to actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that the addition of implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
the expected life of our employee stock options represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding in consideration of historical exercise patterns and the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the mid point of the then current date and their maximum contractual term 
the risk free interest rates are based on the yield curve of united states treasury strip securities in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of our employee stock options 
we have never paid dividends and do not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of our stock based payments to employees 
stock based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based upon historical forfeiture rates  and will adjust our estimate of forfeitures if actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative adjustment in the period of the change and will also impact the amount of stock based compensation expense in future periods 
if factors underlying the above assumptions change in future periods  the associated estimated non cash  stock based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries  benefits  bonus  stock based compensation  license fees  milestone payments due under license agreements  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead and facilities costs 
reimbursed research and development costs under collaborative arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses and are recognized in the period in which the related costs are incurred 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have historically not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
subject to certain limitations  these deferred tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
since we have been unprofitable since inception and the likelihood of future profitability is not assured  we have established a valuation allowance for most of these net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and if we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to increase their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income or additional paid in capital  as appropriate  in that same period 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which relate primarily to issues common among corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results could be materially impacted 
inventories and related reserves inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for symlin and byetta 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for production failures and potential product expiration 
the manufacturing processes for our products are complex 
deviations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures and additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory due to expiration may also result in additional inventory reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze the shelf life  expiration dates and internal sales forecasts  each on a product by product basis 
we expense costs relating to the purchase and production of pre approval inventories as research and development expense in the period incurred until such time as we believe future commercialization is probable and future economic benefit is expected to be recognized 
there were no pre approval inventories capitalized as of december  or convertible senior notes during  we adopted new authoritative guidance that significantly impacts the accounting for our convertible senior notes issued in june by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the notes 
the liability component is measured so the effective interest expense associated with the notes reflects the issuer s borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
the difference between the cash proceeds associated with the notes and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes 
determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and  in effect  the associated interest expense 
according to the guidance  the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
if no similar liabilities exist  estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component  including market interest rates  credit standing  yield curves and volatilities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements  refer to the section titled recently issued accounting standards within note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net product sales net product sales for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and consisted of sales of byetta and symlin  less allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts  and prescription vouchers 
the following table provides information regarding net product sales in millions year ended december  byetta symlin the decrease in net product sales for byetta for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily reflects decreased prescription demand following an august fda update on a prior alert referencing pancreatitis and an allowance for rebates related to the us department of defense s dod tricare retail pharmacy program discussed below 
these decreases are partially offset by higher prices in the year ended december  compared to the same period in the slight decrease in net product sales for symlin for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily reflects higher prices offset by a reserve for the dod s tricare retail pharmacy program discussed below  and a reduction in prescription demand 
we recorded an allowance related to the dod s tricare retail pharmacy program pursuant to a final rule that was issued in march  and became effective may  the final rule clarified the dod s interpretation of the national defense authorization act of  or ndaa  signed into law on january  the final rule changed the process by which rebate obligations for the tricare retail pharmacy program are created such that a contractual agreement is no longer required and that obligation to pay such rebates emanates from the ndaa itself 
in consideration of this final rule we recorded an allowance of million for such rebates for the year ended december   of which million represents a retroactive rebate assessment for sales made during the increase in net product sales for byetta and symlin for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily reflect continued growth in patient demand and the impact of price increases 
sales of our products in future periods may be impacted by numerous factors  including potential competition  the potential approval of additional products including exenatide once weekly  regulatory matters  economic factors and other environmental factors 
revenues under collaborative agreements the following table summarizes the components of revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  amortization of up front payments recognition of milestone payments during the year ended december  amortization of up front payments consists of amounts earned pursuant to our exenatide collaboration agreement with lilly and our obesity collaboration with takeda 
for the years ended december  and  substantially all of the revenue recorded in these periods consists of amounts earned pursuant to our exenatide collaboration agreement with lilly and consists primarily of the continued amortization of up front payments and milestone payments 
amortization of up front payments is largely unchanged for the three years ended december   and during the amortization of up front payments relates to up front payments received in connection with our lilly collaboration  for which amortization ended in  and our collaboration with takeda  for which amortization began in late during and the entire amount of amortization of up front payments relates to our collaboration agreement with lilly 
there were no milestone payments in or  compared to million in milestone payments in earned primarily upon lilly s launch of byetta in the european union 
in future periods  we expect that revenues under collaborative agreements will consist of possible future milestone payments  including million conditioned upon the launch of exenatide once weekly in the united states and continued amortization of the million of the up front payment received from takeda upon signing of our collaboration agreement in this up front payment is being amortized ratably over a ten year period representing the estimated development period of the compounds subject to the takeda collaboration agreement 
following the commercial launch of exenatide once weekly  revenue from collaboration agreements will also include amortization of a portion of the million cash payment received in connection with the exenatide once weekly supply agreement discussed above 
the receipt and recognition as revenue of future substantive milestone payments is subject to the achievement of performance requirements underlying such milestone payments 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million  representing a gross margin of  million  representing a gross margin of  and million  representing a gross margin of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of manufacturing costs associated with byetta and symlin sales during the period 
the increase in gross margin in  as compared to  primarily reflects higher net sales prices and lower unit costs for byetta driven by reduced inventory reserves and efficiencies driven by our reduced cost structure 
the decrease in gross margin in  as compared to  primarily reflects increased production costs for byetta due to lower production volumes  increases in inventory reserves and product mix  including the introduction of the symlinpen  partially offset by higher net sales prices per unit for byetta and symlin 
annual fluctuations in gross margins may be influenced by production volumes  product mix  pricing and the level of sales allowances 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in compared to reflects our reduced cost structure following our recent restructurings 
the million increase in compared to reflects slight increases in promotional spending for byetta and symlin and business infrastructure 
we  along with lilly  are jointly responsible for the co promotion of byetta within the united states  and share equally in sales force costs and external marketing expenses 
accordingly  our selling  general and administrative expenses include our share of these costs in the united states 
research and development expenses currently  our research and development efforts are focused on programs for the treatment of diabetes and obesity in various stages of development 
from inception through  we devoted substantially all of our research and development efforts to symlin 
beginning in  our research and development costs started to include costs for our other drug candidates  primarily byetta and exenatide once weekly 
in we initiated our program for the treatment of obesity with pramlintide and in we commenced our into clinical research program for obesity 
the drug development process in the united states includes a series of steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda  which allows for the initiation of the clinical evaluation of a potential drug candidate in humans 
clinical evaluation is typically comprised of three phases of study phase  phase and phase generally  the majority of a drug candidate s total development costs are incurred during phase  which consists of trials that are typically both the longest and largest conducted during the drug development process 
successful completion of phase clinical testing is followed by the submission of an nda to the fda for marketing approval 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
following initial regulatory approval for a drug candidate  companies generally initiate additional clinical trials aimed at expanding product labeling and market potential 
the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our drug candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
our research and development costs are comprised of salaries and bonuses  benefits  non cash stock based compensation  license fees  milestones under license agreements  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
reimbursed research and development costs under collaborative arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development costs 
we charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our pharmaceutical development capabilities 
these consist primarily of facilities costs and other internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
the following table sets forth information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  diabetes obesity research and early stage programs indirect costs research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with byetta and exenatide once weekly which are shared by lilly pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
research and development expenses by major project have been revised to conform to the current presentation with regard to our change in method of accounting for reimbursed research and development costs under collaborative arrangements see note  summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million decrease primarily reflects our reduced cost structure and decreased development expenses for our obesity programs following recently completed clinical trials  partially offset by increased costs for our diabetes programs associated with manufacturing readiness activities at our ohio manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase primarily reflects continued investments in exenatide once weekly  including manufacturing scale up at our ohio manufacturing facility and costs associated with the ongoing duration clinical trials discussed above under the heading overview  and continued investment in our obesity development programs  including costs associated with the ongoing phase b study evaluating pramlintide and metreleptin discussed above 
collaborative profit sharing collaborative profit sharing was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and consists of lilly s share of the gross margin for byetta sales in the united states 
restructuring in may  we announced a restructuring of our sales force to merge our existing primary care and specialty sales forces into a single organization  or the restructuring 
the restructuring reduced the total number of amylin sales representatives by approximately employees 
we recorded restructuring charges of million during the year ended december  consisting of employee separation costs and facilities related charges 
in november  we announced a strategic restructuring and workforce reduction  or the restructuring  that reduced the size of our san diego workforce by approximately  or employees 
the goal of the restructuring was to better align our cost structure with anticipated revenues and is part of our business plan to become operating cash flow positive on a sustainable basis by the end of in addition  we also consolidated our san diego facilities and have sub leased or intend to sub lease vacated facilities 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded a charge of million for the year ended december  this charge consists primarily of expenses related to facility leases for exited facilities  including impairments of related tenant improvements and employee separation benefits 
during the fourth quarter of we revised the estimated losses associated with the facility leases we ceased using in based upon recently executed sub lease agreements and a related reassessment of current market conditions and recorded an additional loss of million 
the following table sets forth the components of the restructuring charges recognized for the years ended december  and in millions year ended december  facility related charges employee separation costs asset impairments other restructuring charges we have substantially completed all of the above activities included in the restructuring plan and all costs associated with the restructurings were incurred during the years ended december  and interest and other income and expense interest and other income consist primarily of interest income from investment of cash and investments 
interest and other income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to primarily reflects lower average investment balances and lower interest rates in compared to the decrease in compared to primarily reflects lower average investment balances and lower interest rates in as compared to interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense resulting from our long term debt obligations and mark to market gains and losses on derivative financial instruments and includes interest payments and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest and other expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to primarily reflects an increase in interest capitalized to our ohio manufacturing facility and mark to market gains on derivative financial instruments which  in  were mark to market losses 
the increase in compared to primarily reflects additional interest expense for our notes and million long term note payable entered into in december loss on impairment of investments we recognized a loss on impairment of investments of million for the year ended december  the loss represents credit related losses associated with two securities in our portfolio and was based upon the amortized cost basis and the observed market prices for the securities 
at december   gross unrealized losses on our short term investments were million  all of which we determined to be temporary 
we recognized a loss on impairment of investments of million for the year ended december  this primarily represents a recognized million other than temporary impairment loss on an equity investment in a privately held entity based upon our assessment of the entity s financial and technical performance and the entity s ability to raise additional capital in significantly deteriorated financial markets to fund ongoing operations 
we also recognized a million other than temporary impairment loss on a corporate debt security in our investment portfolio based upon our assessment of the impact of bankruptcy proceedings of the issuer on the recoverability of our investment 
net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the decrease in our net loss in compared to primarily reflects the decreased expenses discussed above 
the increase in our net loss in compared to primarily reflects the increased expenses  including the restructuring charge  partially offset by the increased net product sales discussed above 
we may incur operating losses for the next few years 
in november  we announced the restructuring and our business plan to become operating cash flow positive on a sustainable basis by the end of  and in may we announced the restructuring 
however  our ability to reach profitability in the future will be heavily dependent upon the amount of product sales that we achieve for byetta  symlin and exenatide once weekly  if approved 
our ability to achieve profitability in the future will also depend on our ability to control our operating expenses  including ongoing expenses associated with the continued commercialization of byetta and symlin  costs associated with the development and commercialization of exenatide once weekly  if approved  and expenses associated with our research and development programs  including our obesity and our early stage development programs and related support infrastructure 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public sales and private placements of our common and preferred stock  debt financings  payments received pursuant to our exenatide collaboration with lilly and our obesity collaboration with takeda  reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier collaboration agreements  and since the second quarter of  through product sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  and we have million of cash available to us pursuant to the loan agreement with lilly discussed below 
in november  we implemented the restructuring and in may  we implemented the restructuring 
as a result of these restructurings  and other efforts to gain efficiencies in our business  we substantially improved our operating results in and believe we are on track to achieve our stated goals of positive operating cash flows by the end of and operating profitability by the end of our use of cash for capital expenditures decreased in compared to driven by lower capital spending for our manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly located in ohio  partially offset by additional capital expenditures for the development of a pen device for exenatide once weekly 
our current business plan does not contemplate a need to raise additional funds from outside sources  however  we may evaluate opportunities to refinance existing indebtedness from time to time 
if we require additional financing in the future  we cannot assure you that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
although we have previously been successful in obtaining financing through our debt and equity securities offerings  there can be no assurance that we will be able to so in the future  especially given the current adverse economic and credit conditions 
our operating activities provided cash of million in the year ended december  and we used cash of million and million for our operating activities in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our cash provided by our operating activities for the year ended december  includes million of non cash expenses  consisting primarily of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization 
our primary uses of cash for our operating activities includes uses of cash due to increases in other current assets of million  a decrease in restructuring liabilities of million and a decrease in payable to collaborative partner of million 
the increase in other current assets primarily reflects prepayments for raw material inventory 
the decrease in restructuring liabilities reflects payment of employee separation costs associated with our restructuring at the end of and rental payments on vacated facilities that we are actively seeking to sublease 
these restructuring payments are offset by an increase in the liability resulting from expenses associated with the restructuring 
the decrease in payable to collaborative partner primarily reflects a reduced net payable to lilly due to higher cost sharing payments due from lilly due to increased development expenses for exenatide once weekly in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in our primary sources of cash for our operating activities includes sources of cash due to increases in deferred revenue and deferred collaborative profit sharing of million and million  respectively and a decrease in inventories of million 
the increase in deferred revenue reflects the million up front payment we received in connection with the takeda obesity collaboration net of related amortization 
the increase in deferred collaborative profit sharing reflects payments due to us from lilly for its share of the capital expenditures we have made for the exenatide once weekly pen device 
the decrease in inventories primarily reflects reduction in finished goods due to the timing and volume of production for byetta and symlin 
working capital changes may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to timing of inventory and other current asset purchases and the timing of payment of accounts payable  accrued compensation and other current liabilities 
our investing activities used cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property  plant and equipment 
purchases of property  plant and equipment decreased to million in from million in the decrease in was as expected and primarily reflects a reduction of costs associated with our manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly  offset by costs incurred in connection with the exenatide once weekly pen device 
the initial capital investment for the pen is expected to be million over the next few years  which will be funded by lilly and by us 
through december   we have incurred million in capital expenditures associated with the exenatide once weekly pen device 
we have billed lilly million for its share of these expenditures  of which million has been received to date  and is included in cash used for operating activities as discussed above 
purchases of property  plant and equipment increased to in from million in the increases in primarily reflect costs associated with our manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly and  to a lesser extent  purchases of tenant improvements  computer software  office equipment and scientific equipment to support our growth 
we expect that our capital expenditures will continue to decrease in and will be principally focused on strategically investing in exenatide life cycle management  of which lilly shares in of the costs 
through december   we capitalized million associated with the construction of this facility  including million for the exenatide once weekly pen device discussed above 
capital expenditures for our ohio facility also include costs associated with the construction of the facility  purchase and installation of equipment and capitalized labor and materials required to validate the facility 
we will continue to evaluate potential additional investments in our ohio manufacturing facility during the product life cycle for exenatide once weekly 
financing activities used cash of million in the year ended december  and provided cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
financing activities in include repayments of our note payable partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities in include proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities for included proceeds from the exercise of stock options  proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and million in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes 
at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of the notes due april  and million of the notes due june  outstanding 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share and are not redeemable at our option 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share and are not redeemable at our option 
in december  we entered into a million credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit and foreign exchange hedging up to the million borrowing limit 
at december  we had an outstanding balance of million under the term loan  all of which is due in  and had issued million of standby letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
both loans have a final maturity date of december  interest on the term loan is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate equal to above the london interbank offered rate  or libor  of either one  two  three or six months libor term at our election 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement which resulted in a fixed interest rate of under the term loan 
the interest rate on the credit facility is libor plus or the bank of america prime rate  at our election 
in october  we entered into a loan agreement with lilly pursuant to which lilly made available to us a million unsecured line of credit that we can draw upon from time to time until june  as of december  we had not drawn upon this line of credit 
any interest due under this credit facility will bear interest at the five day average three month libor rate immediately prior to the date of the advance plus and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of each quarter 
all outstanding principal  together with all accrued and unpaid interest  shall be due and payable the earlier of months following the date on which the loan commitment is fully advanced or june  the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and maturity dates as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term convertible debt interest on long term convertible debt long term note payable interest on long term note payable  net of swap transactions inventory purchase obligations construction contracts operating leases total the interest payments shown were calculated using a rate of  the net rate from the term loan and interest rate swap  on the outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
includes million of outstanding purchase orders  cancelable by us upon days written notice  subject to reimbursement of costs incurred through the date of cancellation 
also includes million of commitments for exenatide once weekly that are contingent upon fda approval of exenatide once weekly 
excludes long term obligation of million related to deferred compensation  the payment of which is subject to elections made by participants that are subject to change 
in addition  under certain license and collaboration agreements we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of related products 
we expect to make development milestone payments up to million associated with licensing agreements in the next months 
additional milestones of up to approximately million could be paid over the next two to fifteen years if development and commercialization of all our early stage programs continue and are successful 
the majority of these milestones relate to potential future regulatory approvals and subsequent sales thresholds 
given the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development  it is highly unlikely that we will ultimately make all of these milestone payments  however  we would consider these payments as positive because they would signify that the related products are moving successfully through development and commercialization 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of product sales we and lilly achieve for byetta and exenatide once weekly  if approved  net of profit sharing payments to lilly  and product sales for symlin  costs associated with the continued commercialization of byetta and symlin and the commercialization of exenatide once weekly  if approved  costs associated with the operation of our exenatide once weekly manufacturing facility  costs of potential licenses or acquisitions  the potential need to repay existing indebtedness  our ability to receive or need to make milestone payments  our ability  and the extent to which we establish collaborative arrangements for symlin or any of our product candidates  progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing or defending our patents  competing technological and market developments  and costs of manufacturing  including costs associated with establishing our own manufacturing capabilities or obtaining and validating additional manufacturers of our products  and scale up costs for our drug candidates 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in united states government securities  asset backed securities  and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with investment grade credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on our debt are fixed 
the fair value of our notes and notes at december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
we have entered into an interest rate swap in connection with our million term loan 
the fair value of the interest rate swap at december  was a liability of million 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
