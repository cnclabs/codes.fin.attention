description of business we are a billion community based financial services company providing a full range of banking and other financial services to individuals and businesses through our two operating segments community banking and insurance 
our community bank  summit community bank  has a total of banking offices located in west virginia and virginia 
in addition  we also operate an insurance agency  summit insurance services  llc with an office in moorefield  west virginia which offers both commercial and personal lines of insurance and two offices in leesburg  virginia  primarily specializing in group health  life and disability benefit plans 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our segment information 
summit financial group  inc employs approximately full time equivalent employees 
overview our primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits 
business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates  business spending  and consumer confidence  as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace 
key items in net loss for totaled  compared to net income of million in the decline is primarily a result of higher loan loss provisions 
we strengthened our allowance for loan losses to reflect the weaker economy and its current and future impact on asset quality 
the million loan loss provision recorded this year raised the allowance for loan losses to percent of total loans at year end  after net loan charge offs of million during the course of the year 
we continue to be impacted by the housing crisis as reflected by the impairment of certain investments in mortgage backed securities resulting in million in charges recorded relative to these securities in asset quality continues to deteriorate 
in  nonperforming assets increased by million 
our loan quality was impacted by the contracting economy and commercial real estate market  which caused declines in real estate values and deterioration in financial condition of various borrowers 
these conditions led to our downgrading the loan quality ratings on various real estate loans through our normal loan review process 
in addition  several impaired loans became under collateralized due to the reduction in the estimated net realizable fair value of the underlying collateral 
the impact of foregone interest income from nonaccruing loans negatively impacted the margin during as it fell to 
the deposit mix benefited from higher levels of retail deposits  primarily savings accounts  allowing us to reduce brokered deposits and short term borrowings 
we remained well capitalized by regulatory capital guidelines at december  
table of contents outlook summit remains well capitalized and is adequately reserved 
the company has adequate liquidity and is positioned to weather the current economic conditions and return to profitability when conditions improve 
in the short term  however  management anticipates the company s net income and earnings per common share will continue to be negatively impacted by continuing high levels of loan losses and nonperforming assets  a weak economy  modest reductions in total assets and revenues  and higher fdic premiums 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of goodwill and fair value measurements to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section of this financial review 
goodwill goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
a fair value is determined based on at least one of three various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair value equals or exceeds the book value  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value 
during the third quarter of  we completed the required annual impairment test and determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
we can not assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our intangible assets  which include goodwill 
fair value measurements asc topic fair value measurements provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with the three level hierarchy eg  level  level and level established under asc topic fair value determination in accordance with asc topic requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
in determining the fair value of financial instruments  we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available 
we do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance 

table of contents fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc topic  financial instruments 
deferred income tax assets at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
based on our ability to offset the net deferred tax asset against taxable income in prior carryback years  there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at december  all available evidence  both positive and negative  was considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  impairment should be recognized 
however  our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change 
if our forecast of taxable income within the carryback carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets  such assets may become impaired 
business segment results we are organized and managed along two major business segments  as described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the results of each business segment are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand alone business

a summary of the significant factors influencing our results of operations and related ratios is included in the following discussion 
net interest income the major component of our net earnings is net interest income  which is the excess of interest earned on earning assets over the interest expense incurred on interest bearing sources of funds 
net interest income is affected by changes in volume  resulting from growth and alterations of the balance sheet s composition  fluctuations in interest rates and maturities of sources and uses of funds 
we seek to maximize net interest income through management of our balance sheet components 
this is accomplished by determining the optimal product mix with respect to yields on assets and costs of funds in light of projected economic conditions  while maintaining portfolio risk at an acceptable level 
consolidated net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis  consolidated average balance sheet amounts  and corresponding average yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years  and are presented in table i 
table ii presents  for the periods indicated  the changes in consolidated interest income and expense attributable to a changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate and b changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior period volume 
changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
tables i and ii are presented on a consolidated basis 
the results would not vary significantly if presented on a continuing operations basis 
consolidated net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis  totaled   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively  representing a decrease in and a increase in the decrease in is primarily the result of higher levels of nonaccruing loans  and the impact of the reversal of interest income at the time 
table of contents those loans were placed on nonaccrual status 
the increase in net interest income was the result of substantial loan growth in the commercial real estate and residential mortgage portfolios 
total average earning assets increased to  at december  from  at december  total average interest bearing liabilities increased to  at december   compared to  at december  as identified in table ii  consolidated tax equivalent net interest income decreased  in and grew  during our consolidated net interest margin was for compared to and for and  respectively 
our consolidated net interest margin decreased basis points in and basis points in  driven primarily by the reversal of loan interest income related to nonaccrual loans placed on nonaccrual status during both periods and the continued reduction in interest income as a result of these loans remaining on nonaccrual status 
the present continued low interest rate environment has served to positively impact our net interest margin due to our liability sensitive balance sheet  as the cost of interest bearing funds decreased basis points in and basis points in see tables i and ii for further details regarding changes in volumes and rates of average assets and liabilities and how those changes affect our consolidated net interest income 
we anticipate a stable net interest margin in the near term as we do not expect interest rates to rise in the near future  we do not expect significant growth in our interest earning assets  nor do we expect our nonperforming asset balances to decline significantly in the near future 
we continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact 
see the market risk management section for further discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us

refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our loan maturities and a discussion of our adjustable rate loans as of december  in the normal course of business  we make various commitments and incur certain contingent liabilities  which are disclosed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements but not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
there have been no significant changes in these types of commitments and contingent liabilities and we do not anticipate any material losses as a result of these commitments

pursuant to asc topic investments debt and equity securities  anytime that we carry a security with an unrealized loss that has been determined to be other than temporary  we must recognize that loss in income 
during  we took other than temporary non cash impairment charges of million pre tax  equivalent to million after tax  related to certain nongovernment sponsored residential mortgage backed securities  with a book value of million 
during  we took an other than temporary non cash impairment charge of million pre tax  equivalent to million after tax  related to million of certain preferred stock issuances of the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation that we continue to own with a book value of  the action taken by the federal housing finance agency on september  placing these government sponsored agencies into conservatorship and eliminating the dividends on their preferred shares led to our determination that these securities are other than temporarily impaired 
we also recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of million the entire amount on our investment in greater atlantic financial corp 
stock  which we continue to own 

table of contents at december   we had million in unrealized losses related to residential mortgage backed securities issued by nongovernment sponsored entities 
we monitor the performance of the mortgages underlying these bonds 
although there has been some deterioration in collateral performance  we only hold primarily senior tranches of each issue which provides protection against defaults 
we attribute the unrealized loss on these mortgage backed securities held largely to the current absence of liquidity in the credit markets and not to deterioration in credit quality 
we expect to receive all contractual principal and interest payments due on our debt securities and have the ability and intent to hold these investments until their fair value recovers or until maturity 
the mortgages in these asset pools have been made to borrowers with strong credit history and significant equity invested in their homes 
they are well diversified geographically 
nonetheless  significant further weakening of economic fundamentals coupled with significant increases in unemployment and substantial deterioration in the value of high end residential properties could extend distress to this borrower population 
this could increase default rates and put additional pressure on property values 
should these conditions occur  the value of these securities could decline further and trigger the recognition of additional other than temporary impairment charges 
at december   we did not own securities of any one issuer that were not issued by the us treasury or a us government agency that exceeded ten percent of shareholders equity

funds acquired through this program are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet in short term borrowings or long term borrowings  depending on the repayment terms of the debt agreement 
we also had million available on a short term line of credit with the federal reserve bank at december   which is primarily secured by consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans 
short term borrowings total short term borrowings decreased  from  at december  to  at december  these borrowings were principally replaced with retail deposits and principal paydowns of mortgage backed securities 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures regarding our short term borrowings 
long term borrowings total long term borrowings of  at december  and  at december   consisted primarily of funds borrowed on available lines of credit from the federal home loan bank and structured reverse repurchase agreements with two unaffiliated institutions

long term borrowings were principally used to fund our loan growth 
refer to note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our long term borrowings 
subordinated debentures we have subordinated debt which qualifies as tier regulatory capital totaling million at december  and million at december  during  we issued million in subordinated debt  of which million was issued to an affiliate of a director of summit 
we also issued million and million to two unrelated parties 
these three issuances bear an interest rate of percent per annum  have a term of years  and are not prepayable by us within the first five years 
during  million of subordinated debt was issued to an unrelated institution  which bears a variable interest rate of month libor plus basis points  has a term of years  and it is not prepayable by us within the first two and one half years 
asset quality due to current recessionary economic conditions  borrowers have in many cases been unable to refinance their loans due to a range of factors including declining property values 
as a result  we have experienced higher delinquencies and nonperforming assets  particularly with regard to our construction development  residential real estate  and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
it is not known when the housing market will stabilize 
management anticipates loan delinquencies will remain higher than historical levels in the near term  and we anticipate that nonperforming assets will remain elevated for the foreseeable future

as a result of our internal loan review process  the ratio of internally criticized loans to total loans increased from at december  to at december  and to at december  our internal loan review process includes a watch list of loans that have been specifically identified through the use of various sources  including past due loan reports  previous internal and external loan evaluations  classified loans identified as part of regulatory agency loan reviews and reviews of new loans representative of current lending practices 
once this watch list is reviewed to ensure it is complete  we review the specific loans for collectability  performance and collateral protection 
in addition  a grade is assigned to the individual loans utilizing internal grading criteria  which is somewhat similar to the criteria utilized by our subsidiary bank s primary regulatory agency 
the increase in internally criticized loans at december  and occurred throughout our portfolios of real estate related loans  as shown in the table below  as several of these loans have been downgraded by management as they fell outside of our internal lending policy guidelines  became past due or were placed on nonaccrual status 
the decrease during in the land development and construction category was primarily the result of foreclosures 

table of contents table xi internally criticized loans balance at december  dollars in thousands commercial commercial real estate land development construction residential real estate consumer total included in the above table of internally criticized loans are approximately million of performing loans which we have identified as potential problem loans at december  related to relationships 
known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have concerns as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the current loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that other loans will not become days or more past due  be placed on nonaccrual  or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of three distinct reserve components specific reserves related to loans individually evaluated  quantitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated  and qualitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated 
a summary of the methodology we employ on a quarterly basis with respect to each of these components in order to evaluate the overall adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is as follows specific reserve for loans individually evaluated first  we identify loan relationships having aggregate balances in excess of  and that may also have credit weaknesses 
such loan relationships are identified primarily through our analysis of internal loan evaluations  past due loan reports  and loans adversely classified by regulatory authorities 
each loan so identified is then individually evaluated to determine whether it is impaired that is  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreement 
substantially all of our impaired loans are and historically have been collateral dependent  meaning repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely from the sale of the loan s underlying collateral 
for such loans  we measure impairment based on the fair value of the loan s collateral  which is generally determined utilizing current appraisals 
a specific reserve is established in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the recorded investment in each impaired loan over the fair value of its underlying collateral  less estimated costs to sell 
our policy is to re evaluate the fair value of collateral dependent loans at least every twelve months unless there is a known deterioration in the collateral s value  in which case a new appraisal is obtained 
quantitative reserve for loans collectively evaluated second  we stratify the loan portfolio into the following ten loan pools land and land development  construction  commercial  commercial real estate owner occupied  commercial real estate non owner occupied  conventional residential mortgage  jumbo residential mortgage  home equity  consumer  and other 
loans within each pool are then further segmented between loans which were individually evaluated for impairment and not deemed to be impaired  larger balance loan relationships exceeding million which are assigned an internal risk rating in conjunction with our normal ongoing loan review procedures and smaller balance homogenous loans 
quantitative reserves relative to each loan pool are established as follows for loan segments and above  the recorded investment of these loans within each pool are aggregated according to their internal risk ratings  and an allocation ranging from to of the respective pool s average historical net loan charge off rate determined based upon the most recent twelve quarters is applied to the aggregate recorded investment in loans by internal risk category  such lower rated loan relationships receive higher allocations of reserves  for loan segment above  an allocation equaling of the respective pool s average historical net loan charge off rate determined based upon the most recent twelve quarters is applied to the aggregate recorded investment in the smaller balance homogenous pool of loans 
qualitative reserve for loans collectively evaluated third  we consider the necessity to adjust our average historical net loan charge off rates relative to each of the above ten loan pools for potential risks factors that could result in actual losses deviating from prior loss experience 
for example  if we observe a significant 
table of contents increase in delinquencies within the conventional mortgage loan pool above historical trends  an additional allocation to the average historical loan charge off rate is applied 
such qualitative risk factors considered are levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and term of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practice  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
relationship between allowance for loan losses  net charge offs and nonperforming loans in analyzing the relationship between the allowance for loan losses  net loan charge offs and nonperforming loans  it is helpful to understand the process of how loans are treated as they deteriorate over time 
reserves for loans are established at origination through the quantitative and qualitative reserve process discussed above 
if the quality of a loan which is reviewed as part of our normal internal loan review procedures deteriorates  it migrates to a lower quality risk rating  and accordingly  a higher reserve amount is assigned 
charge offs  if necessary  are typically recognized in a period after the reserves were established 
if the previously established reserves exceed that needed to satisfactorily resolve the problem credit  a reduction in the overall level of the reserve could be recognized 
in summary  if loan quality deteriorates  the typical credit sequence is periods of reserve building  followed by periods of higher net charge offs 
consumer loans are generally charged off to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency  in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council policy 
for example  credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes days past due or within days from receiving notification about a specified event eg  bankruptcy of the borrower  whichever is earlier 
residential mortgage loans are generally charged off to net realizable value no later than when the account becomes days past due 
other consumer loans  if collateralized  are generally charged off to net realizable value at days past due 
substantially all of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate 
the substantial majority of these loans were underwritten in accordance with our loan to value policy guidelines which range from at the time of origination 
although property values have deteriorated across our market areas  the fair values of the underlying collateral value remains in excess of the recorded investment in many of our nonperforming loans  and therefore  no specific reserve allocation is required  as of december   approximately of our impaired loans required no reserves 
accordingly  our allowance for loan losses has not increased proportionately as our nonperforming loans have increased 
the allowance for loan loss will  however  increase as a result of an increase in net loan charge offs due to the incremental higher historical net charge off rate applied to the loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment 
at december  and  our allowance for loan losses totaled  or of total loans and  or of total loans  respectively  and is considered adequate to cover inherent losses in our loan portfolio

liquidity is provided primarily by funds invested in cash and due from banks net of float and reserves  federal funds sold  non pledged securities  and available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank  which totaled approximately  or of total consolidated assets at december  our liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits and other borrowed funds while maintaining an adequate level of short and medium term investments to meet normal daily loan and deposit activity 
core deposits increased million in  while loans decreased approximately million and securities decreased million 
this allowed us to pay down a significant portion of our short term fhlb borrowings  and to reduce our brokered certificates of deposit by not renewing them at maturity 
as a member of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  we have access to approximately million 
as of december  and  these advances totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity of million through fhlb programs 
we have established a line with the federal reserve bank to be used as a contingency liquidity vehicle 
the amount available on this line at december  was approximately million  which is secured by a pledge of our consumer and commercial and industrial loan portfolios 
also  we classify all of our securities as available for sale to enable us to liquidate them if the need arises 
we continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that day to day as well as anticipated funding needs are met 
we are not aware of any trends  commitments  events or uncertainties that have resulted in or are reasonably likely to result in a material change to our liquidity 
growth and expansion during  we spent approximately million on capital expenditures for premises and equipment 
we expect our capital expenditures to approximate million in  primarily for equipment upgrades 
management anticipates that the company s near term growth in assets will be very nominal in comparison with that of recent prior years due to the present recessionary economic environment and our limited excess capital resources

we intend to maintain both summit s and its subsidiary bank s capital ratios at levels that would be considered to be well capitalized in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our regulatory capital

we also issued million and million to two unrelated parties 
these three issuances bear an interest rate of percent per annum  have a term of years  and are not prepayable by us within the first five years 
during  we issued million of subordinated debentures which qualifies as tier capital 
this debt has an interest rate of month libor plus basis points  a term of years  and is not prepayable by us within the first two and a half years 
on september   we issued million of non cumulative convertible preferred stock 
although we have not finalized plans to issue additional securities  we are currently exploring the merits of conducting an additional offering of the series preferred stock to our existing shareholders 
stock repurchases in august  our board of directors authorized the open market repurchase of up to  shares approximately of the issued and outstanding shares of our stock 
during  we did not repurchase any shares under this plan  and no further share repurchases are presently contemplated 
issuance of trust preferred securities under federal reserve board guidelines  we had the ability to issue an additional million of trust preferred securities as of december  that would qualify as tier regulatory capital to support our future growth 
trust preferred securities issuances in excess of this limit generally may be included in tier capital 
dividends cash dividends per common share were and in and the related dividend payout ratio is not meaningful for as a result of our unprofitability  while the dividend payout ratio was for future cash dividends will depend on the earnings  and financial condition of our subsidiary bank and our capital adequacy as well as general economic conditions 
as discussed below under regulatory matters  we are presently restricted from paying cash dividends on our common stock 
the primary source of funds for the dividends paid to our shareholders is dividends received from our subsidiary bank 
dividends paid by our subsidiary bank are subject to restrictions by banking law and regulations and require approval by the bank s regulatory agency if dividends declared in any year exceed the bank s current year s net income  as defined  plus its retained net profits of the two preceding years 
during  the net retained profits available for distribution to summit as dividends without regulatory approval are approximately  plus net income for the interim periods through the date of declaration 
however  the bank is presently required to give days prior written notice of its intent to pay any cash dividends to its regulatory authorities to give regulatory authorities an opportunity to object 
regulatory matters summit and the bank  have entered into informal memoranda of understanding mou s with their respective regulatory authorities 
a memorandum of understanding is characterized by the regulatory authorities as an informal action that is not published or publicly available and that is used when circumstances warrant a milder form of action than a formal supervisory action  such as a formal written agreement or order 
among other things  under the mou s  summit s management team has agreed to the bank achieving and maintaining a minimum tier leverage capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least the bank providing days prior notice of any declaration of intent to pay cash dividends to provide the bank s regulatory authorities an opportunity to object  summit suspending all cash dividends on its common stock until further notice 
dividends on all preferred stock  as well as interest payments on subordinated notes underlying summit s trust preferred securities  continue to be permissible  and  summit not incurring any additional debt  other than trade payables  without the prior written consent of the principal banking regulators

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of embedded options 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to minimize interest rate risk and our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of our asset liability management committee alco 
the alco is comprised of members of senior management and members of the board of directors 
the alco actively formulates the economic assumptions that we use in our financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor our sources  uses and prices of funds 
some amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate to the banking business 
our net income is affected by changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   our interest rate risk position was liability sensitive 
that is  liabilities are likely to reprice faster than assets  resulting in a decrease in net interest income in a rising rate environment  while a falling interest rate environment would produce an increase in net interest income 
net interest income is also subject to changes in the shape of the yield curve 
in general  a flat yield curve results in a decline in our earnings due to the compression of earning asset yields and funding rates  while a steepening would result in increased earnings as margins widen 
several techniques are available to monitor and control the level of interest rate risk 
we primarily use earnings simulations modeling to monitor interest rate risk 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effects on net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
each increase or decrease in rates is assumed to gradually take place over a month period  and then remain stable  except for the up scenario  which assumes a gradual increase in rates over months 
assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits are derived from historical analysis 
securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds 
noncontractual deposit repricings are modeled on historical patterns 
the following table presents the estimated sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates  as measured by our earnings simulation model as of december  the sensitivity is measured as a percentage change in net interest income given the stated changes in interest rates gradual change over months  stable thereafter for the up and down and the up scenarios  and gradual change over months for the up scenario compared to net interest income with rates unchanged in the same period 
the estimated changes set forth below are dependent on the assumptions discussed above and are well within our alco policy limit  which is a reduction in net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period 
change in estimated change in net interest rates interest income over basis points months months down up up up assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve assumes bp increase over months
