critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this report  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the company as follows revenue from system contracting projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and  therefore  take into account the costs  estimated earnings and revenue to date on contracts not yet completed 
revenue recognized is that percentage of the total contract price that cost expended to date bears to anticipated final total cost  based on current estimates of costs to complete 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs  and depreciation costs 
selling  general  and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
claims for additional contract costs are recognized upon a signed change order from the customer 
revenue from product sales is recognized when the goods are delivered and title has passed 
product sales revenue represents the invoiced value of goods  net of the value added tax vat 
all of the company s products that are sold in the prc are subject to a chinese value added tax at a rate of percent of the gross sales price 
this vat may be offset by vat paid by the company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing their finished product 
revenue from the rendering of maintenance services is recognized when such services are provided 
provision is made for foreseeable losses as soon as they are anticipated by management 
where contract costs incurred to date plus recognized profits less recognized losses exceed progress billings  the surplus is treated as an amount due from contract consumers 
where progress billings exceed contract costs incurred to date plus recognized profits less recognized losses  the surplus is treated as an amount due to contract customers

translation adjustments resulting from this process are included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are included in the results of operations as incurred 
historically  the company has not engaged in any currency trading or hedging  although there is no assurance that the company will not enter into such activities in the future 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the combined financial statements and accompanying notes 
management believes that the estimates utilized in preparing its financial statements are reasonable and prudent 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
certain of the company s accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include the recognition of revenue and earnings from system contracting projects under the percentage of completion method and the allowance of doubtful accounts 
management evaluates all of its estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
accounts receivable accounts receivable represents the products sales  maintenance services and system contracting projects with its customers that were on credit

each customer has a maximum credit limit 
the company seeks to maintain strict control over its outstanding receivables 
overdue balances are reviewed regularly by senior management 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the weighted average method

recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  asc  amendments to the impairment guidance of asc  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
asc changes the impairment model included within asc to be more consistent with the impairment model of asc asc achieves this by amending the impairment model in asc to remove its exclusive reliance on market participant estimates of future cash flows used in determining fair value 
changing the cash flows used to analyze other than temporary impairment from the market participant view to a holder s estimate of whether there has been a probable adverse change in estimated cash flows allows companies to apply reasonable judgment in assessing whether other than temporary impairment has occurred 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements because all of the investments in debt securities are classified as trading securities 
in april  the asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly asc amends asc and provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with asc when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly for fair value measurements 
this accounting standard shall be applied prospectively with retrospective application not permitted 
the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

this fsp will replace the existing requirement that the entity s management assert it has both the intent and ability to hold an impaired debt security until recovery with a requirement that management assert it does not have the intent to sell the security  and it is more likely than not it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis 
this asc provides increased disclosure about the credit and noncredit components of impaired debt securities that are not expected to be sold and also requires increased and more frequent disclosures regarding expected cash flows  credit losses  and an aging of securities with unrealized losses 
although this fsp does not result in a change in the carrying amount of debt securities  it does require that the portion of an other than temporary impairment not related to a credit loss for a held to maturity security be recognized in a new category of other comprehensive income and be amortized over the remaining life of the debt security as an increase in the carrying value of the security 
the adoption of asc and asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asc and asc this asc amends asc  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments not measured on the balance sheet at fair value in interim financial statements as well as in annual financial statements 
prior to this asc  fair values for these assets and liabilities were only disclosed annually 
this asc applies to all financial instruments within the scope of asc and requires all entities to disclose the method s and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
the adoption of asc and asc did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

asc requires an ongoing reassessment of whether a company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
asc also requires additional disclosures about a company s involvement in variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not completed the assessment of the impact asc will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

in addition  the amendments require enhanced disclosures about the risks that a transferor continues to be exposed to because of its continuing involvement in transferred financial assets 
comparability and consistency in accounting for transferred financial assets will also be improved through clarifications of the requirements for isolation and limitations on portions of financial assets that are eligible for sale accounting

r 
the amendments in this accounting standards update replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which reporting entity  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity 
an approach that is expected to be primarily qualitative will be more effective for identifying which reporting entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
the amendments in this update also require additional disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement in variable interest entities  which will enhance the information provided to users of financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this asu  however  we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
our cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes and consist primarily of bank deposits 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we currently do not have any long term debt 
our exposure to interest rate risk primarily relates to the interest income generated by excess cash invested in demand deposits 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio in order to reduce interest rate risk 
interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk and our future interest income may change  depending on market interest rate movement 
foreign currency risk our business is primarily operated in the prc  and its value is effectively denominated in renminbi 
the fluctuation of foreign exchange rate between us dollars and renminbi could affect the value of our common stock 
our revenues and expenses are primarily denominated in renminbi  and so our exposure to foreign exchange risks to renminbi should generally be limited 
in  we began to develop our business in india  revenues and expenses of our operations there are denominated in india s rupee 
however the revenue contribution from our operations in india is immaterial to our overall business  representing only percent of total revenue in thus  we believe that our exposure to foreign exchange risks to the indian rupee should generally be limited 
we do not have material monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars  although to the extent that we do in the future  the fluctuation of foreign exchange rate would affect the value of these monetary assets and liabilities denominated in us dollars 
generally  appreciation of the renminbi against us dollars will devaluate the assets and liabilities denominated in us dollar  while devaluation of renminbi again us dollars will appreciate the assets and liabilities denominated in us dollar 
in china  very limited hedging transactions are available to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future  the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all
