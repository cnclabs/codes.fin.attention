item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item of this report 
historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results 
business overview we are a life science company focused on the development and commercialization of genomic based clinical diagnostic tests for cancer that allow physicians and patients to make individualized treatment decisions 
our oncotype dx platform utilizes quantitative genomic analysis in standard tumor pathology specimens to provide tumor specific information  or the oncotype of a tumor  in january  we launched our first oncotype dx test  which is used to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence and the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit in early stage breast cancer patients 
effective july   we increased the list price of our oncotype dx breast cancer test from  to  in january  we launched our second oncotype dx test  which is used to predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence in stage ii colon cancer patients 
the list price for our oncotype dx colon cancer test is  substantially all of our historical revenues have been derived from the sale of oncotype dx breast cancer tests ordered by physicians in the us all of our tests are conducted at our clinical reference laboratory in redwood city  california 
our current clinical reference laboratory processing capacity is approximately  tests per calendar quarter 
as test processing for our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests is essentially the same  except that the tests use different rna extraction methods  we believe that we currently have sufficient capacity to process both of our tests 
oncotype dx breast cancer test for the year ended december   more than  oncotype dx breast cancer test reports were delivered for use in treatment planning  compared to more than  and more than  test reports delivered for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   more than  breast cancer tests had been delivered for use in treatment planning 
we believe increased demand resulted from our ongoing commercial efforts  continued publication of peer reviewed articles on studies we sponsored  conducted or collaborated on that support the use and reimbursement of test  clinical presentations at major symposia  and the inclusion of our breast cancer test in clinical practice guidelines 
however  this increased demand is not necessarily indicative of future growth rates  and we cannot assure you that this level of increased demand can be sustained or that publication of articles  future appearances or presentations at medical conferences or increased commercial efforts will have a similar impact on demand for our breast cancer test in the future 
we have in the past  and may in the future  experience slower sequential growth in demand for our test in the second and third calendar quarters  which we believe may be attributed to physicians  surgeons and patients scheduling vacations during this time 
we depend upon third party payors to provide reimbursement for our test 
accordingly  we have focused substantial resources on obtaining reimbursement coverage from third party payors 
several large national third 
table of contents party payors  a number of regional payors  and the local medicare carrier for california with jurisdiction for claims submitted by us for medicare patients  have issued positive coverage determinations for our oncotype dx breast cancer test for patients with node negative  or n  estrogen receptor positive  or er  disease through contracts  agreements or policy decisions 
beginning in the second half of and continuing through  we experienced an increase in usage of our oncotype dx breast cancer test for node positive  or n  patients 
while some payors provide policy coverage for the use of our test in patients with lymph node micro metastasis greater than mm  but not greater than mm in size  a substantial portion of our existing reimbursement coverage has been limited to women with early stage n  er breast cancer 
effective june   the local carrier with jurisdiction for claims submitted for us by medicare extended its coverage for breast cancer test to include er patients with n disease up to three positive lymph nodes 
however  we may not be able to obtain additional reimbursement coverage from other payors for our test for breast cancer patients with n  er disease 
in september  we began accepting all appropriate breast cancer tumor samples  regardless of immunohistochemistry  or ihc  er status  to facilitate assessment of uncertain er status by either ihc or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  or rt pcr  testing 
an oncotype dx breast cancer recurrence score is generated if the er status is positive by ihc or positive by rt pcr  even if the sample was negative by ihc when submitted 
in these cases  the tests will be billed to the third party insurer or to the patient 
if the sample is er negative by both ihc and rt pcr  neither the third party payor nor the patient will be billed 
the processing of tests that we do not bill payors or patients for will increase our expenses 
in january  we hired an additional us sales representatives  increasing our domestic sales force to a total of sales representatives 
we have also continued to expand internationally 
as of december   we had received test samples from more than countries and established exclusive distribution agreements for our oncotype dx breast cancer test with partners in countries outside of the us we established a european subsidiary in february and have lead executives with assignments in the americas  europe  and asia to support our international efforts 
we have completed or initiated multiple international clinical studies intended to support the adoption of our breast cancer test outside of the us while we plan to use essentially the same business model as we use in the us  there are significant differences between countries that need to be considered 
for example  different countries may have a public healthcare system  a combination of public and private healthcare system or a cash based payment system 
we may decide to work directly on our own in certain countries while continuing to utilize distribution agreements in other countries 
although we have continued to expand our sales  marketing and reimbursement efforts outside the us  we do not expect international product revenues to comprise more than of our total revenues for at least the next year or more 
oncotype dx colon cancer test at the may american society of clinical oncology  or asco  meeting  we announced positive results from our independent clinical validation study in stage ii colon cancer for our oncotype dx colon cancer test 
the study demonstrated that our test can independently predict the individual recurrence risk in stage ii colon cancer patients following surgery  and indicated that the colon cancer recurrence score provided additional independent clinical value beyond standard measures of risk 
based upon these study results  we proceeded with commercialization activities in and launched our colon cancer test in january we expect to focus substantial resources on obtaining adoption of our oncotype dx colon cancer test 
we believe the key factors that will drive adoption of this test include our continued publication of peer reviewed articles on studies we sponsored  conducted or collaborated on that support the use and reimbursement of our test  clinical presentations at major symposia and our ongoing commercial efforts 
we are working with public and private payors and health plans to secure coverage for our colon cancer test based upon clinical evidence showing the utility of the test 
we may need to hire additional scientific  technical and other personnel to support this process 
we have not obtained reimbursement coverage from third party payors for our oncotype dx colon cancer test 
as a new test  our colon cancer test may be considered investigational by payors and therefore may not be covered under their reimbursement policies 
consequently  we intend to pursue case by case reimbursement and expect that the test will continue to be reviewed on this basis until policy decisions have been made by individual payors 
we 
table of contents believe it may take several years to achieve reimbursement with a majority of third party payors 
however  we cannot predict whether  or under what circumstances  payors will reimburse for our test 
based upon our experience in obtaining adoption and reimbursement for our oncotype dx breast cancer test  we do not expect product revenues from our colon cancer test to comprise more than of our total revenues for at least the next year or more 
product pipeline we are investigating the utility of oncotype dx in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ  or dcis  which generally refers to a pre invasive tumor with reduced risk of recurrence 
we plan to evaluate the use of the oncotype dx gene breast cancer panel and also seek to identify other genes that may be used for treatment planning in dcis 
we plan to continue conducting early development tests to evaluate our colon cancer test for treatment planning in stage iii disease  and we are also conducting studies to investigate our colon cancer test s ability to predict chemotherapy benefit in stage ii and stage iii colon cancer patients treated with oxaliplatin 
in  we initiated our first prostate gene identification study 
we also completed our first renal gene identification study under our collaboration agreement with pfizer inc for the development of a genomic test to estimate the risk of recurrence following surgery for patients with stage i iii renal carcinoma  clear cell type  that has not spread to other parts of the body 
economic environment continuing concerns over inflation  deflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  the federal stimulus plan  federal budget proposals  the us mortgage market and a declining real estate market in the us have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy and expectations of slower global economic growth going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence  a volatile stock market and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic slowdown and recession 
we have evaluated the impact of this environment on our cash management  cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments  and we expect that we will continue to be able to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities 
from time to time  we monitor the financial position of our significant third party payors  which include medicare and managed care companies 
as of the date of this report  we do not expect the current economic environment to have a material negative impact on our ability to collect payments from third party payors in the foreseeable future 
the economic slowdown could negatively impact the volume of tests we deliver if patients lose healthcare coverage  delay medical checkups or are unable to pay for our test 
we intend to continue to assess the impact of the economic environment on our business activities 
if the economic climate in the us does not improve or continues to deteriorate  our cash position  cash collection activities and volume of tests delivered could be negatively impacted and we could experience lower revenues 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we determine whether revenue is recognized on an accrual basis when test results are delivered or on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor 
our revenues for tests performed are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the nature of the fee charged for the products or services delivered and existing contractual agreements 
when evaluating collectibility  we consider whether we have sufficient history to reliably estimate a payor s individual payment patterns 
based upon at least several months of payment history  we review the number of tests paid against the number of tests billed and the payor s outstanding balance for unpaid tests to determine whether payments are being made at a consistently high percentage of tests billed and at appropriate amounts given the contracted payment amount 
to the extent all criteria set forth above are not met  including where there is no evidence of payment history at the time test results are delivered  product revenues are recognized on a cash basis when cash is received from the payor 
as of december   we had distributor agreements in countries outside of the us the distributor provides us with certain marketing and administrative services within its territory 
as a condition of these agreements  the distributor pays us an agreed upon fee per test and we process the tests 
the same revenue recognition criteria described above generally apply to tests received through international distributors 
product revenues for tests performed are recognized on an accrual basis when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to the extent all criteria set forth above are not met when test results are delivered  product revenues are generally recognized when cash is received from the distributor 
from time to time  we receive requests for refunds of payments  generally due to overpayments made by third party payors 
upon becoming aware of a refund request  we establish an accrued liability for tests covered by the refund request until such time as we determine whether or not a refund is due 
if we determine that a refund is due  we credit cash and reduce the accrued liability 
accrued refunds were  and million at december  and  respectively 
contract revenues are generally derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recognized on a contract specific basis 
under certain contracts  revenues are recognized as costs are incurred or assays are processed 
we may exercise judgment when estimating full time equivalent level of effort  costs incurred and time to project completion 
for certain contracts  we utilize the performance based method of revenue recognition  which requires that we estimate the total amount of costs to be expended for a project and recognize revenue equal to the portion of costs expended to date 
the estimated total costs to be expended are necessarily subject to revision from time to time as the underlying facts and circumstances change 
allowance for doubtful accounts we accrue an allowance for doubtful accounts against our accounts receivable based on estimates consistent with historical payment experience 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated quarterly and adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that a change in estimate is appropriate 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
the year over year decrease in our allowance for doubtful accounts reflected the impact of writedowns and improved collections on outstanding accounts receivable 
research and development expenses we enter into collaboration and clinical trial agreements with clinical collaborators and record these costs as research and development expenses 
we record accruals for estimated study costs comprised of work performed by our collaborators under contract terms 
we record accruals for estimated study costs based on estimates of services received and effort expended by our collaborators pursuant to these agreements 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiations  may vary from contract to contract  and may result in uneven payment flows 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical development personnel and outside service 
table of contents providers as to the progress or stage of completion of services provided and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research and development activities are deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
all potential future product programs outside of breast and colon cancer are in the research or early development phase 
although we have estimated the time frame in which some of these products may be brought to market  the timing is uncertain given the technical challenges and clinical variables that exist between different types of cancers 
in  we began maintaining information regarding costs incurred for activities performed under certain contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 
however  we do not generally record or maintain information regarding costs incurred in research and development on a program specific basis 
our research and development staff and associated infrastructure resources are deployed across several programs 
many of our costs are thus not attributable to individual programs 
as a result  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development programs or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
stock based compensation expense our employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes option valuation model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the application of option valuation models requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions used in determining fair value 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of estimates such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value stock based compensation 
prior to january  our assumptions regarding expected volatility were based primarily on comparable peer data because our common stock had been publicly traded for less than two years 
as of january  our assumptions regarding expected volatility are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected life of options is estimated based on historical option exercise data and assumptions related to unsettled options 
expected option forfeiture rates are based on historical data  and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results 
we review our valuation assumptions on an ongoing basis  and  as a result  our valuation assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods may change 
see note  stock based compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for more information 
deferred tax assets we are required to reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must use judgment in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance  which requires an evaluation of both negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
in determining the need for and amount of our valuation allowance  if any  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets using historical levels of income  estimates of future income and tax planning strategies 
as a result of recent cumulative losses  we determined that  based on all available evidence  there was substantial uncertainty as to our ability to realize recorded net deferred taxes in future periods 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and we recorded a net loss for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively 
on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we may incur net losses in future periods due to future spending  and we do not expect to achieve sustained profitability for at least the next year or more 

table of contents revenues we derive our revenues primarily from product sales and  to a lesser extent  from contract research arrangements 
we operate in one industry segment 
as of december   all of our product revenues have been derived solely from the sale of our oncotype dx breast cancer test 
payors are billed upon generation and delivery of a recurrence score report to the physician 
product revenues are recorded on a cash basis unless a contract or arrangement to pay is in place with the payor at the time of billing and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract revenues are derived from studies conducted with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies and are recorded as contractual obligations are completed 
year ended december  in thousands product revenues contract revenues total revenues year over year dollar increase in product revenues year over year percentage increase in product revenues the year over year increases in product revenues resulted from increased adoption  as evidenced by a increase in test volume for compared to and a increase in test volume for compared to we also experienced expanded reimbursement coverage and an increase in the amount of revenue recognized per test 
product revenues for the year ended december  were affected by delayed receipt of approximately million in payments from two third party payors 
the delays resulted from interruptions in payments due to contract and documentation requirements  which have since been resolved 
these payments are expected to be recognized as product revenue when received 
the timing of recognition of revenue related to these and other third party payments may cause fluctuations in product revenues from period to period 
approximately million  or  of product revenues for the year ended december   were recorded on an accrual basis and recognized at the time the test results were delivered  compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for all periods  the balance of product revenues was recognized upon cash collection as payments were received 
product revenues on behalf of medicare patients for the year ended december  were million  or  of product revenues  compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
product revenues from united healthcare insurance company for the year ended december  were million  or  of product revenues  compared to million  or  and million  or  of product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no other third party payors with product revenues of or more for those years 
contract revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract revenues represented studies assessing our gene expression technology or collaborative work in gene selection and protocol design with our pharmaceutical partners 
the increase in contract revenues for compared to was due entirely to ongoing activities related to our collaboration with pfizer inc the increase in contract revenues for compared to included the recognition of million in related to the completion of a contract 
we expect that our contract revenues will continue to fluctuate based on the number and timing of studies being conducted 

table of contents cost of product revenues year ended december  in thousands tissue sample processing costs employee stock based compensation total tissue sample processing costs license fees total cost of product revenues year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase cost of product revenues represents the cost of materials  direct labor  equipment and infrastructure expenses associated with processing tissue samples including histopathology  anatomical pathology  paraffin extraction  rt pcr  quality control analyses and shipping charges to transport tissue samples and license fees 
infrastructure expenses include allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
costs associated with performing our test are recorded as tests are processed 
costs recorded for tissue sample processing represent the cost of all the tests processed during the period regardless of whether revenue was recognized with respect to that test 
royalties for licensed technology calculated as a percentage of product revenues and fixed annual payments relating to the launch and commercialization of oncotype dx tests are recorded as license fees in cost of product revenues at the time product revenues are recognized or in accordance with other contractual obligations 
license fees represent a significant component of our cost of product revenues and are expected to remain so for the foreseeable future 
test volume increased in compared to  and in compared to  driving the million  or  and million  or  year over year increases in tissue sample processing costs 
license fees increased million  or  in compared to and million  or  in compared to while license fees are generally calculated as a percentage of product revenues  the percentage increase in license fees does not correlate exactly to the percentage increase in product revenues because certain agreements contain provisions for fixed annual payments and other agreements have tiered rates and payments that may be subject to annual minimum or maximum amounts 
we expect the cost of product revenues to increase in future periods to the extent we process more tests  including our oncotype dx colon cancer test launched in january research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation collaboration expenses reagents and laboratory supplies infrastructure and all other costs total research and development expenses year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase research and development expenses represent costs incurred to develop our technology and carry out clinical studies and include personnel related expenses  reagents and supplies used in research and development laboratory work  infrastructure expenses  including allocated overhead and facility occupancy costs  contract services and other outside costs 
research and development expenses also include costs related to activities performed under contracts with biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies 

table of contents the million increase in research and development expenses for compared to included a million increase in allocated information technology salaries and benefits and other costs related to the development of our colon cancer test  a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in reagents and laboratory supplies  a  increase in collaborations expense due primarily to gene discovery work and a  increase in infrastructure and other costs 
the million increase in personnel related expenses included million in salary increases and  in higher benefits and other expenses 
the increases in reagents  laboratory supplies and collaboration expenses were primarily due to early development studies for renal  prostate  and small cell lung cancer programs 
the million increase in research and development expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in stock based compensation and a  increase in costs incurred for reagents and laboratory supplies 
the million increase in personnel related expenses was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expenses related to an increase in headcount year over year 
we expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we increase investment in our product pipeline for a variety of cancers  including cancers other than breast and colon 
selling and marketing expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation promotional and marketing materials travel  meetings and seminars infrastructure and all other costs total selling and marketing expenses year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase our selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses  education and promotional expenses and infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
these expenses include the costs of educating physicians  laboratory personnel and other healthcare professionals regarding our genomic technologies  how our oncotype dx tests are developed and validated and the value of the quantitative information that our tests provide 
selling and marketing expenses also include the costs of sponsoring continuing medical education  medical meeting participation and dissemination of scientific and economic publications related to our oncotype dx platform 
our sales force compensation includes annual salaries and eligibility for quarterly commissions based on the achievement of predetermined sales goals 
the million increase in selling and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to an million increase in personnel related expenses  a million increase in infrastructure and other expenses  a million increase in promotional field expenses and marketing materials  a million increase in travel related expenses  and a  increase in stock based compensation 
these increases included costs related to the addition of us sales representatives in january and to our international expansion activities 
of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to increases in salaries  benefits and related expenses  million was attributable to higher consulting expenses to support our international expansion and colon product launch   was attributable to higher commissions and bonus payments  and  was attributable to increases in recruiting and relocation expenses 
the million increase in selling and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related expenses  reflecting our investment in our field sales and support organization  a million increase in infrastructure and other expenses  including allocations for facilities expansion and improvements and medical affairs support for breast cancer product enhancements  a million 
table of contents increase in promotional field expenses and marketing materials  a  increase in travel related expenses  primarily associated with field sales personnel  and a  increase in stock based compensation 
of the million increase in personnel related expenses  million was attributable to increases in salaries  benefits and related expenses   was attributable to higher commissions and bonus payments and  was attributable to higher contract labor and consulting expenses 
we expect selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to our efforts to establish adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test  the increase in our sales force  and the expansion of our commercial efforts in international markets 
in january  we hired an additional us sales representatives  increasing our domestic sales force to a total of sales representatives 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands personnel related expenses employee stock based compensation professional fees and all other costs total general and administrative expenses year over year dollar increase year over year percentage increase our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses and professional fees and other costs  including legal fees  advisory and auditing expenses  billing and collection costs  bad debt expense and other professional and administrative costs and related infrastructure expenses  including allocated facility occupancy and information technology costs 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses for compared to included a million increase in billing and collection fees related to increases in the number of tests processed and cash collections  an  increase in personnel related expenses  due primarily to salary increases and benefits expenses  a  increase in professional fees  due primarily to legal fees related to regulatory and international matters  a  increase in stock based compensation  a  increase in infrastructure expenses  a  increase in travel related expenses and a  increase in bad debt expense 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses for compared to included a million increase in personnel related expenses due primarily to an increase in headcount year over year  a million increase in bad debt expense related to a change in our estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts and growth in our aged accounts receivable balances  a million increase in billing and collections expense related to increases in the number of tests processed and cash collected  a  increase in stock based compensation and a  increase in professional fees  due primarily to legal fees related to regulatory and other matters  and a  increase in infrastructure and other expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we hire additional staff and incur other expenses to support the growth of our business and to the extent we spend more on fees for billing and collections as we process more tests 
interest and other income interest and other income was  for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income for compared to reflected lower market yields on our investments in the decrease in interest and other income for compared to reflected decreased interest income due to lower average cash and short term investment balances compared to the prior year  which reflected the investment of a portion of the proceeds from our may common stock offering  and lower market yields on our investments in 
table of contents we expect our interest and other income may continue to decrease if the overall decline in the interest rate environment related to the current economic crisis continues 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year over year decreases were due to lower average balances on our equipment financing notes as we paid them down 
we expect our interest expense to decline as we continue to make payments on these notes  which are scheduled to be paid in full by november we do not anticipate using additional equipment financing as a funding source in the next twelve months 
income tax expense benefit for the year ended december   we recorded income tax expense of approximately  which was principally comprised of california state income tax  federal alternative minimum tax and foreign taxes which were based on our estimated taxable income for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately  for the years ended december  and  we did not record a provision for income taxes because we estimated and incurred a taxable loss for both years 
as a result of cumulative losses since inception and based on all available evidence  we continue to believe that there is substantial uncertainty as to whether we will recover recorded net deferred taxes in future periods 
accordingly  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not yet achieved profitability  we may incur net losses in the future  and we cannot provide assurance as to when  if ever  we will achieve or maintain profitability 
we expect that our research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and  as a result  we will need to generate significant product revenues to achieve profitability 
in thousands as of december cash  cash equivalents and short term investments working capital for the year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources of liquidity at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million compared to million at december  the  increase was attributable to increased cash collections from sales of our tests and payments from collaborators  which were offset by investments in the growth of our business  including research and development  international expansion and activities related to our colon product launch in january in accordance with our investment policy  available cash is invested in short term  low risk  
table of contents investment grade debt instruments 
our cash and short term investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including money market accounts  u 
s treasury securities  debt obligations of us government sponsored entities  high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper 
at december   our holdings of debt obligations of us government sponsored entities consisted entirely of debt securities issued by the federal home loan bank  the federal national mortgage association and the federal home loan mortgage corporation

net cash provided by used in operating activities includes net loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  reflected a net loss of million  adjusted for million of depreciation and stock based compensation expense  and a million increase in accrued compensation expense  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable  prepaid assets and other assets and a million decrease in deferred revenues 
net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december  reflected a net loss of million  adjusted for million of depreciation and stock based compensation expense  and a million increase in accounts receivable  prepaid assets and other assets  partially offset by a million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities  a million increase in deferred revenue  which included million in advance collaboration contract payments  and a  increase in accrued compensation expense 
net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  reflected a net loss of a million  adjusted for million of depreciation and stock based compensation expense  and a million increase in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other assets  partially offset by a million increase in accrued compensation expense and a million increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our investing activities have consisted predominantly of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million in net purchases of marketable securities and million of capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  included million in net purchases of marketable securities as we invested a portion of the cash proceeds from our may public offering of common stock and million of capital expenditures for facility expansion and improvements 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to capital expenditures for facility expansion and improvements 
net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   compared to net cash used in financing activities of million and net cash provided by financing activities of million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our financing activities included sales of our equity securities and capital equipment financing arrangements 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included million in payments on our equipment financing notes payable  partially offset by million in proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  included million in payments on our notes payable  partially offset by million in proceeds from issuance of common stock

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands non cancelable operating lease obligations notes payable obligations total our non cancelable operating lease obligations are for laboratory and office space 
in september  we entered into a non cancelable lease for  square feet of laboratory and office space in redwood city  california 
in january  we entered into a non cancelable lease for  square feet of additional laboratory and office space in a nearby location 
both leases expire in february in october  we entered into a non cancelable agreement to lease an additional  square feet of office space near our current locations  which commences in april this lease expires in march our notes payable obligations are for principal and interest payments on capital equipment financing 
in march  we entered into an arrangement to finance the acquisition of laboratory equipment  computer hardware and software  leasehold improvements and office equipment 
in connection with this arrangement  we granted the lender a security interest in the assets purchased with these borrowings 
we can prepay all  but not part  of the amounts owing under the arrangement so long as we also pay a premium on the remaining payments 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance under this arrangement was  at annual interest rates ranging from to  depending upon the applicable note 
the notes payable under this arrangement are scheduled to be paid in full by november we are required to make a series of fixed annual payments under one of our collaboration agreements beginning on the date that we commercially launched our oncotype dx breast cancer test 
we made payments under this agreement of  in each of the years  and at december   future annual payments under this agreement totaled  of which  is due in each of the years and we are also required to make a series of fixed annual payments under a separate collaboration agreement totaling million beginning with the january launch of our oncotype dx colon cancer test 
we are required to make payments of  in   in   in and  in each of  and however  because both of these agreements may be terminated by either party upon days prior written notice  these payments are not included in the table above 
we have also committed to make potential future payments to third parties as part of our collaboration agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of specific project milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is generally neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such commitments have not been included in the table above 
off balance sheet activities as of december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we achieved positive operating cash flow for the year ended december  we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with payments for our oncotype dx tests  will be sufficient to fund our operations and facilities expansion plans for at least the next months  including the expansion of our research and development programs  establishment of adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test  and our international expansion efforts 
we expect to spend approximately million over the next months for planned laboratory equipment  leasehold improvements and other capital expenditures to support the growth of our business 
we expect that our cash  cash equivalents and short term 
table of contents investments will be also be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes  such as licensing technology rights  partnering arrangements for our tests outside of the u 
s  establishing direct sales capabilities outside of the us or reduction of debt obligations 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
the amount and timing of actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon a number of factors  such as the amount of cash provided by our operations  the progress of our commercialization efforts  product development  regulatory requirements and progress in reimbursement for our tests 
we cannot be certain that our international expansion  efforts to establish adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test or the development of future products will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional funds to see these programs through to a successful result 
it may take years to move any one of a number of product candidates in research through development and validation to commercialization 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the following the rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international third party payors  the cost of expanding our commercial and laboratory operations  including our selling and marketing efforts  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with expansion of our oncotype dx breast and colon cancer tests  the rate of progress and cost of selling and marketing activities associated with establishing adoption of and reimbursement for our oncotype dx colon cancer test  the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities associated with products in research and early development focused on cancers other than breast and colon cancer  the cost of acquiring or achieving access to tissue samples and technologies  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  costs related to international expansion  the cost and delays in product development as a result of any changes in regulatory oversight applicable to our products or operations  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaborations  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter or acquisitions we might seek to effect 
until we can generate and maintain sufficient product revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations 
the issuance of equity securities may result in dilution to stockholders  or may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds by issuing debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
the terms of debt securities or borrowings could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more research and development programs or selling and marketing initiatives 
in addition  we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our product or market development programs  which could lower the economic value of those programs to our company 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued authoritative guidance that amends existing guidance for identifying separate deliverables in a revenue generating transaction where multiple 
table of contents deliverables exist  and provides guidance for allocating and recognizing revenue based on those separate deliverables 
the guidance is expected to result in more multiple deliverable arrangements being separable than under current guidance and is required to be applied prospectively to new or significantly modified revenue arrangements 
this guidance  for which we are currently assessing the impact on our financial condition and results of operations  will become effective for us on january  in january  fasb issued authoritative guidance intended to improve disclosures about fair value measurements 
the guidance requires entities to disclose significant transfers in and out of fair value hierarchy levels and the reasons for the transfers and to present information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements separately in the reconciliation of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level 
additionally  the guidance clarifies that a reporting entity should provide fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclose the inputs and valuation techniques used for fair value measurements using significant other observable inputs level and significant unobservable inputs level 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the level reconciliation  which will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  as this guidance provides only disclosure requirements  the adoption of this guidance will not impact our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
our investment policy provides for investments in short term  low risk  investment grade debt instruments 
our investments in marketable securities  which are comprised primarily of money market funds  obligations of us government agencies and government sponsored entities  high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
due to recent financial and economic conditions  similar investments have experienced losses in value and liquidity constraints which differ from historical patterns 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  totaling million at december   did not include any auction preferred stock  auction rate securities or mortgage backed investments 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure  and we do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
the securities in our investment portfolio are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
to date  we have not experienced a loss of principal on any of our investments 
although we currently expect that our ability to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities will continue  we cannot ensure that this will not change 
we believe that  if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the impact on the fair value of these securities or our cash flows or income would not be material 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our revenues are recognized in us dollars 
certain expenses related to our international activities are payable in foreign currencies 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our total payables denominated in foreign currencies as of december  were not material 
the functional currency of our wholly owned european subsidiary is the us dollar  so we are not currently subject to gains and losses from foreign currency translation of the subsidiary financial statements 
we currently do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate exposure 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has been immaterial in the past  there can be no guarantee the impact of currency fluctuations related to our international activities will not be material in the future
