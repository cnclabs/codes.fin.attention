item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a throughout this annual report on form k  transatlantic holdings  inc the company  and collectively with its subsidiaries  trh presents its operations in the way it believes will be most meaningful 
in certain instances  trh s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae are presented net of related reinsurance recoverable net loss reserves in accordance with principles prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities  as these are standard measures in the insurance and reinsurance industries 
financial statements the following discussion refers to the consolidated financial statements of trh as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december   which are presented elsewhere herein 
financial data discussed below have been affected by certain transactions between trh and related parties 
see notes   and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
executive overview the operations of the company are conducted principally by its three major operating subsidiaries transatlantic reinsurance company trc  trans re zurich trz and putnam reinsurance company putnam and are managed based on its geographic segments 
through its operations on six continents  trh offers reinsurance capacity on both a treaty and facultative basis structuring programs for a full range of property and casualty products  with an emphasis on specialty lines  which may exhibit greater volatility of results over time than most other lines 
such capacity is offered through reinsurance brokers and  to a lesser extent  directly to domestic and foreign insurance and reinsurance entities 
trh conducts its business and assesses performance through segments organized along geographic lines 
the domestic segment principally includes financial data from branches in the united states except miami  as well as revenues and expenses of the company including interest expense on the company s senior notes and stock based compensation expense 
data from the london and paris branches and from trz are reported in the aggregate as international europe and considered as one segment due to operational and regional similarities 
data from the miami which serves latin america and the caribbean  toronto  hong kong and tokyo branches are grouped as international other and represents the aggregation of segments that are generally not material 
trh s operating strategy emphasizes product and geographic diversification as key elements in managing its level of risk concentration 
trh seeks to focus on more complex risks within the casualty and property lines and adjusts its mix of business to take advantage of market opportunities 
over time  trh has most often capitalized on market opportunities when they arise by strategically expanding operations in an existing location or opening a branch or representative office in new locations 
trh s operations serving international markets leverage trh s product knowledge  worldwide resources and financial strength  typically utilizing indigenous management and staff with a thorough knowledge of local markets and product characteristics 
in  casualty lines comprised of trh s net premiums written  while property lines totaled 
in addition  treaty reinsurance totaled of net premiums written  with the balance representing facultative accounts 
business written by international operations represented of net premiums written in trh s major sources of revenues are net premiums earned for reinsurance risks undertaken and income from investments 
the great majority of trh s investments are in fixed maturity securities held to 
table of contents maturity and available for sale 
in general  premiums are received significantly in advance of related claims payments 
secondary public offering of the company s common stock by american international group  inc aig  and collectively with its subsidiaries  the aig group prior to june  and as of december  and  aig beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding shares 
on june   aig and american home assurance company ahac  a wholly owned subsidiary of aig  consummated the secondary public offering the offering of million issued and outstanding shares of the common stock of the company owned by aig and ahac 
trh did not receive any proceeds from the offering 
according to the form f filed on february  by aig  as of december   the aig group had sole voting authority over million shares of the company s common stock  representing approximately of the company s outstanding shares as of december  as a result of the offering  the company is no longer considered a controlled company pursuant to the corporate governance listing standards of the new york stock exchange nyse and is no longer able to avail itself of the exemptions from certain of the nyse s corporate governance listing standards applicable to controlled companies subject to the rules of the nyse permitting a phase in period for compliance with such corporate governance listing standards 
in connection with the offering  trh entered into a master separation agreement the msa with aig and ahac on may  the msa sets forth trh s agreements with aig and ahac regarding the orderly separation of trh from aig  ahac and their subsidiaries the separation and governs certain aspects of trh s relationship with aig  ahac and their subsidiaries on a going forward basis  including their waiver of certain rights they may have under intercompany agreements and insurance agreements 
in connection with the offering  trh also entered into a a transition services agreement the tsa with aig  b a stockholders agreement the stockholders agreement with aig and ahac  and c a registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement with aig and ahac 
the tsa sets forth trh s agreements with aig regarding the provision by aig  ahac and their subsidiaries of limited services to trh for a specified period of time following the separation 
as of december   all service agreements under the tsa have expired 
the stockholders agreement provides aig and ahac with certain information and consent rights and will subject aig  ahac  and their respective subsidiaries  affiliates  officers and directors to certain standstill provisions 
additionally  pursuant to the stockholders agreement  aig  ahac and their subsidiaries are subject to voting and transfer restrictions covering their shares of the company s common stock 
the registration rights agreement provides aig and ahac with registration rights relating to any shares of the company s common stock held by them 
aig and ahac may require trh to register under the securities act of all or a portion of these shares 
the registration rights are subject to certain limitations  including trh s right to temporarily suspend the registration of shares 
trh is a party to numerous contracts  agreements  licenses  permits  authorizations and other arrangements the applicable arrangements and authorizations that contain provisions giving counterparties certain rights including  in some cases  termination rights in the event of a change in control of the company or its subsidiaries 
if a change in control occurs  cedants may be permitted to cancel contracts on a cut off or run off basis  and trh may be required to provide collateral to secure premium and reserve balances or may be required to cancel and commute the contract  subject to an agreement between the parties that may be settled in arbitration 
if a contract is cancelled on a cut off basis  trh may be required to return unearned premiums  net of commissions 
the offering may be deemed to have constituted a change in control of trh under a portion of trh s non aig group reinsurance agreements 
whether a ceding company would have cancellation 
table of contents rights in connection with the offering depends upon the language of its agreement with trh 
whether a ceding company exercises any cancellation rights it has would depend on  among other factors  such ceding company s views with respect to the prevailing market conditions  the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage and trh s ratings 
as of december   no cedants have notified trh of their intention to exercise any cancellation rights they may have as a result of the offering 
see item a 
risk factors for a description of the possible impact of a change in control on trh 
consolidated results the following table summarizes trh s revenues  income before income taxes and net income for the periods indicated years ended december  amount change from prior year amount change from prior year amount dollars in millions revenues income before income taxes net income revenues increased in compared to due primarily to a decrease in realized net capital losses 
the decrease in realized net capital losses was due principally to a decrease in other than temporary impairments otti and an increase in realized net capital gains losses on sales and redemptions of securities in as financial and credit markets stabilized and partially recovered from the turmoil at the end of see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements note e for a breakdown of realized net capital losses 
revenues decreased in compared to due primarily to significant realized net capital losses and a decrease in net investment income  partially offset by an increase in net premiums earned 
the significant realized net capital losses of million  including million of otti  in generally resulted from declines in market values due to the downturn in the us economy  turmoil in the financial markets  financial market illiquidity and issuer specific credit events 
the decrease in net investment income was due largely to a decrease in investment results from other invested assets  principally related to alternative investments  partially offset by an increase in fixed maturity income 
the increase in net premiums earned emanated primarily from domestic operations and the miami and london branches 
the most significant increases in net premiums earned occurred in the accident and health a h  property  credit and auto liability lines  partially offset by significant decreases in the fidelity and ocean marine lines 
in general  changes in net premiums earned between periods were influenced by prevailing market conditions and strategic decisions by trh s management in recent periods 
while there were no significant catastrophe losses for events occurring in  the year included a reduction of pre tax net catastrophe costs incurred of million relating to events occurring in prior years 
results for included pre tax net catastrophe costs of million principally arising from hurricane ike 
results for included pre tax net catastrophe costs of million principally arising from european windstorm kyrill and floods in the uk catastrophe costs include losses incurred and related reinstatement premiums  the details of which can be found in note of notes to consolidated financial statements note 
reinstatement premiums may arise on both assumed and ceded business as a result of contractual provisions found in certain catastrophe excess of loss reinsurance contracts that require additional premium to be paid in the event of a loss to reinstate coverage for the remaining portion of the contract period 
net assumed ceded reinstatement premiums serve to increase decrease net premiums written and earned 

table of contents income before income taxes and net income increased in compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in realized net capital losses and increased underwriting profit 
the increase in underwriting profit was primarily due to decreased catastrophe costs and an increase in favorable net loss reserve development in the increase in net income between periods was reduced by the significant tax expense in caused by the improved results in decreased catastrophe costs and increased favorable net loss reserve development had the net impact of increasing pre tax underwriting profit in by million compared to income before income taxes and net income decreased in as compared to principally due to significant realized net capital losses  including significant amounts of otti  and decreases in underwriting profit loss and net investment income 
the decrease in net income between periods was mitigated by significant deferred tax benefits in the decrease in underwriting profit loss was largely due to decreased current accident year underwriting profit loss excluding catastrophe costs in compared to and a significant increase in net catastrophe costs partly offset by a decrease in net loss reserve development 
higher catastrophe costs and lower net loss reserve development in had the net impact of decreasing pre tax underwriting profit loss in by million compared to see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for underwriting profit loss by segment 
underwriting profit loss is defined as net premiums earned less net losses and lae incurred  net of commissions and other underwriting expenses  plus minus any increase decrease in deferred acquisition costs 
see operational review for further discussion 
market conditions and outlook the market conditions in which trh operates have historically been cyclical  experiencing periods of price erosion followed by rate strengthening as a result of catastrophes or other significant losses or events that affect the overall capacity of the industry to provide coverage 
for the years under discussion  the reinsurance market has been characterized by significant competition worldwide in most lines of business 
additionally  trh is exposed to the operating cycles of primary insurers as the rates charged by  and the policy terms associated with  primary insurance agreements may affect the rates charged by  and the policy terms associated with  reinsurance agreements  particularly for pro rata reinsurance business 
following improvements in the us property marketplace after significant catastrophe losses in and  additional capacity entered the reinsurance market in the form of new companies in bermuda as well as the entrance of capacity from the capital markets via sidecars  catastrophe bonds and other derivative products 
the entrance of the new capacity slowly eroded property insurance and reinsurance rates through the first half of  although the marketplace remained generally favorable 
during the second half of  however  the global credit and financial crisis began to significantly impact the insurance and reinsurance markets 
first  many alternative reinsurance solutions such as sidecars were terminated or not renewed 
second  the impairment of insurance company balance sheets meant historical risk levels in many cases now represented a higher than desired percentage of surplus 
third  hurricane ike produced one of the highest insured losses from a natural peril event despite being only a category storm 
these changes produced an increase in demand for traditional reinsurance from insurance companies as they could not raise capital by issuing debt  did not want to issue equity at depressed stock prices and lost the ability to access the capital markets for alternative reinsurance solutions 
in addition  many reinsurers  affected by similar issues  could not maintain the levels of capacity that they had in recent years to take on risk 
trends in reinsurance rates at the beginning of were inconsistent  with rates increasing  staying level or deteriorating depending on the line of business or region 
however  as progressed  improvements in general economic conditions  the strengthening of insurers and reinsurers balance 
table of contents sheets and the low level of catastrophe losses in put downward pressure on reinsurance rates 
insurers had greater capacity to retain risk and increased access to capital market alternatives to reinsurance compared to late  while the strengthening of reinsurer balance sheets increased the amount of capacity available in the reinsurance market 
despite weakness in primary rates in several casualty lines and an increase in capacity  reinsurers generally remained disciplined during the january  renewal period 
the january  renewals generally saw higher net retentions by cedants and reinsurance rates remaining within acceptable levels while exhibiting greater stability than primary rates 
more specifically  rates on casualty lines were uneven in certain lines  like directors and officers liability d o of financial institutions have shown rate increases  while others have been flat or shown decreases 
results in many casualty lines have benefited from favorable accident year loss severity and frequency trends in  but these trends may not be sustainable 
during the january  renewal period  casualty insurance rates generally remained under pressure  with some modest improvements in certain lines 
rates will likely remain under pressure in the near future as excess capacity  good results in recent accident years and strong cedant balance sheets hinder improvements 
however  the current low investment yield environment combined with the potential of increased inflation in the future and deterioration from current favorable loss severity and frequency trends may lead to a hardening of casualty reinsurance rates in the future 
in property lines  some catastrophe exposed regions  particularly peak zones  saw significant rate increases in the first half of  which leveled off in the second half of overall this business remained acceptable through the january  renewal period  with rates in the us down slightly and rates outside of the us generally flat 
the strengthening of insurers balance sheets also led to higher net retentions by cedants during the january  renewal period 
the lack of significant catastrophe losses in and the strengthening of cedants balance sheets may lead to more downward pressure on property reinsurance rates going forward 
the existence of favorable or improving market conditions in certain regions and lines of business does not necessarily translate into ultimate pricing adequacy for business written under such conditions 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these favorable or improving conditions will occur or remain in effect in the future 
starting in mid and continuing through  the us residential mortgage market and the global credit and financial markets experienced serious disruptions  although some improvement was evident by the end of trh s operating results and financial condition have been adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected by this disruption 
see disruption in global credit and financial markets 
however  the current global credit and financial markets may present attractive opportunities for strategic acquisitions and investments  particularly given trh s strong capital position  financial resources and reputation  which trh may  from time to time  evaluate and pursue

critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on trh s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
trh relies on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable  under the circumstances  to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 

table of contents trh believes its most critical accounting estimates are those with respect to loss reserves  fair value measurements of certain financial assets  otti of investments  premium revenues and deferred acquisition costs  as they require management s most significant exercise of judgment on both a quantitative and qualitative basis in the preparation of trh s consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
the accounting estimates that result require the use of assumptions about certain matters that are highly uncertain at the time of estimation 
to the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used  trh s results of operations and financial condition would be affected  possibly materially 
a discussion of these most critical accounting estimates follows a loss reserves estimates of loss reserves take into account trh s assumptions with respect to many factors that will affect ultimate loss costs but are not yet known 
the ultimate process by which actual carried reserves are determined considers not only actuarial estimates but a myriad of other factors 
such factors  both internal and external  which contribute to the variability and unpredictability of loss costs  include trends relating to jury awards  social inflation  medical inflation  worldwide economic conditions  tort reforms  court interpretations of coverages  the regulatory environment  underlying policy pricing  terms and conditions and claims handling  among others 
in addition  information gathered through underwriting and claims audits is also considered 
to the extent that these assumptions underlying the loss reserve estimates are significantly incorrect  ultimate losses may be materially different from the estimates included in the financial statements and may materially and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 
the impact of those differences is reflected in the period they become known 
the reserving process is inherently difficult and subjective  especially in view of changing legal and economic environments which impact the development of loss reserves  and therefore quantitative techniques frequently have to be supplemented by subjective considerations and managerial judgment 
in addition  trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur or affect development to the same degree in the future 
while this process is difficult and subjective for ceding companies  the inherent uncertainties of estimating loss reserves are even greater for reinsurers  due primarily to the longer term nature of much reinsurance business  the diversity of development patterns among different types of reinsurance treaties or facultative contracts  the necessary reliance on the ceding companies for information regarding reported claims and differing reserving practices among ceding companies  which are subject to change without notice 
nevertheless  data received from cedants is subjected to audits periodically by trh claims and underwriting personnel  to help ensure that reported data is supported by proper documentation and conforms to contract terms  and is analyzed  as appropriate  by trh underwriting and actuarial personnel 
such analysis often includes a detailed review of reported data to assess the underwriting results of reinsurance assumed and to explain any significant departures from expected performance 
over time  reported loss information is ultimately corroborated when such information eventually attains paid status 
standard actuarial methodologies employed to estimate ultimate losses incorporate the inherent lag from the time claims are reported to the cedant to when the cedant reports the claims to the reinsurer 
certain actuarial methodologies may be more appropriate than others in instances where this lag may not be consistent from period to period 
consequently  additional actuarial judgment is employed in the selection of methodologies to best incorporate the potential impact of this situation 
generally  for each line of business  significant actuarial judgments are made with respect to the following factors used in the loss reserve setting process loss trend factors are used to establish expected loss ratios elrs for subsequent accident years based on the projected loss ratios for prior accident years 
provisions for inflation and social inflation eg  awards by judges and juries which progressively increase in size at a rate exceeding 
table of contents that of general inflation and trends in court interpretations of coverage are among the factors which must be considered 
elrs for the latest accident years generally reflect the elrs from prior accident years adjusted for the loss trend see loss trend factors discussion  as well as the impact of rate level changes and other quantifiable factors 
for certain longer tail lines of business that are typically lower frequency  higher severity classes  such as excess medical malpractice and d o  elrs are often utilized for the last several accident years 
loss development factors are used to arrive at the ultimate amount of losses incurred for each accident year based on reported loss information 
these factors  which are initially calculated based on historical loss development patterns ie  the emergence of reported losses over time relative to the ultimate losses to be paid may then be adjusted for current trends 
during the loss settlement period  which can be many years in duration  additional facts regarding individual claims and trends usually become known 
as these facts and trends emerge  it usually becomes necessary to refine and adjust the loss reserves upward or downward and even then the ultimate net liability may be materially different from the revised estimates 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves when actual costs differ from those costs implied by the use of the assumptions employed in the reserve setting process 
this is particularly true for assumed reinsurance of long tail casualty classes 
among the most critical assumptions are those made for elrs and loss development factors 
the methodologies that trh employed to assess the reasonableness of loss reserve estimates included the paid loss development  incurred loss development  paid bornhuetter ferguson b f and incurred b f methods 
the actuarial methods that trh employs to determine the appropriate loss reserves for short tail lines of business are the same as those employed for longer tail lines 
however  the judgments that are made with regard to factors such as loss trends  elrs and loss development factors for shorter tail lines generally have much less of an effect on the determination of the loss reserve amount than when those same judgments are made regarding longer tailed lines of business 
in contrast to the longer tailed lines of business  reported losses for the shorter tailed classes  such as the property lines of business eg  fire and homeowners multiple peril and certain marine and energy classes  generally reach the ultimate level of incurred losses in a relatively short period of time 
rather than having to rely on assumptions regarding elrs and loss development factors for many accident years for a given line  these assumptions are generally only relevant for the most recent accident year or two 
therefore  these assumptions tend to be less critical and the reserves calculated pursuant to these assumptions are subject to less variability for the shorter tailed lines of business 
the characteristics of each line of business are considered in the reserving process 
trh s major lines of business and reserve methodologies are discussed below other liability the key components of the other liability line of business are excess casualty  d o and errors and omissions liability e o 
excess casualty the vast majority of this class consists of domestic treaties  including pro rata and excess of loss contracts of general liability business 
excess casualty is dominated by umbrella business  some of which have very high attachment points 
this business is generally very long tailed and characterized by relatively low frequency and high severity type losses 
therefore  expected loss ratio methods  such as the incurred b f method  are heavily relied upon for most years due to the lack of mature reported experience available 
the elrs utilized for the most recent years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios of prior years adjusted for rate level changes  estimated loss cost trends and other quantifiable changes  as well as actuarial pricing indications 

table of contents d o and e o these classes are dominated by high layer excess of loss d o business as well as e o classes such as lawyers and accountants 
much of this business is domestic  although significant amounts are written by the london branch 
this business is reviewed separately by operating branch and for pro rata versus excess of loss contracts and for treaty versus facultative 
additionally  homogeneous groupings of accountant  lawyer  and architect and engineer risks are reviewed separately 
these classes are long tailed in nature  often characterized by very high attachment points 
therefore  b f methods are generally relied upon for the most recent years due to the lack of mature reported experience 
the selections for older years will often be based on the weighted average of the loss development methods and b f methods 
the selection of elrs for these classes is generally analogous to that of the excess casualty class described above but with added emphasis on actuarial pricing indications  as these accounts are often very large and are virtually all actuarially reviewed before the business is underwritten 
medical malpractice healthcare professional  which is the most significant component of trh s medical malpractice line of business  is reviewed separately for treaty and facultative contracts 
pro rata contracts are reviewed separately from excess of loss contracts 
there is significant volume in all categories 
this class is also quite long tailed due to the excess of loss nature of most of the contracts 
due to the lack of mature reported experience  b f methods are generally utilized for the most recent five underwriting years with some weight given to the loss development methods for earlier years 
because almost all of these accounts are actuarially priced  the indications from these reviews are critical to the selection of the elrs 
shorter tailed lines these would include the property lines of business such as fire and homeowners multiple peril  a h and certain marine and energy classes 
these lines are written by several of trh s worldwide offices and the reserves are reviewed separately for each operating branch 
where sufficiently credible experience exists  these lines are reviewed after segregating pro rata contracts from excess of loss contracts 
for a reinsurer  these lines do not develop to ultimate loss as quickly as when written on a primary basis  however  they are significantly shorter tailed than the casualty classes discussed earlier 
for these classes  a combination of loss development methods and b f methods are used 
generally  selections for all but the most recent few years are based on loss development methods with the most recent years based on weightings of loss development and expected loss ratio indications 
a comprehensive annual loss reserve review is conducted in the fourth quarter of each year 
the review is conducted in full detail for each class or line of business for each underwriting office and consists of more than one hundred individual analyses 
in completing these detailed actuarial reserve analyses significant actuarial judgment is often employed 
trh is required to make numerous assumptions  including the selection of loss development factors and elrs 
additionally  trh needs to select the most appropriate actuarial method s to employ for each class of business 
triangles of written premium  paid losses and incurred losses are organized by underwriting year evaluated at six month intervals 
the data triangles are split by branch  contract type ie  treaty versus facultative  line of business and often between excess of loss and pro rata business 
the line of business groupings vary by branch and are reviewed annually to ensure a proper balance between homogeneity and credibility of data 
in the loss development methods  paid and incurred losses by underwriting year are projected to an ultimate basis by applying appropriate age to ultimate development factors to the inception to date paid and incurred losses 
the development factors are selected based on curves fitted to the historical average which best represent the data 
in the b f methods  estimates of unpaid and unreported losses are arrived at by multiplying underwriting year earned premium by an elr and an estimated percentage of unpaid or unreported losses 
these percentages of unpaid or unreported losses are derived from the loss development factors described above 
these methods yield an indication of the ultimate losses for each underwriting year 
the indicated incurred but not reported ibnr 
table of contents reserve need is then determined by year  by line of business by subtracting the reported losses which are equal to the sum of inception to date paid losses and the case reserves as of the balance sheet date from the indicated ultimate losses 
in the course of these detailed loss reserve reviews  which are performed by year and by line of business  a point estimate of the loss reserve need is determined 
differences between the indications arising from the various methods are analyzed to understand the drivers of these differences  so that trh can make a selection based on the methods that are believed to be most appropriate for that line of business 
frequently  the selection is based on an average of the various indications  giving the most weight to the indications deemed most appropriate 
generally speaking  trh is often able to give more weight to loss development indications for more mature years where credible reported losses exist  as opposed to the more current years  where the b f method is often highly relied upon due to the lack of credible and mature reported experience 
when the actuarial point estimate is compared to the carried reserve  it is recognized that there is an implicit range around the indicated point estimate whereby a carried reserve within that range may be considered reasonable 
trh reviews the appropriateness of the held reserves relative to the indicated point estimate considering many factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the amount and direction of any difference between the point estimate and the held reserve  any operational issues which may be difficult to actuarially quantify  various actuarial assumptions on which management may want additional input or any observations regarding optimism or conservatism which management may believe need to be considered 
thus  the carried reserves  as determined by management  may be more or less than the actuarially determined point estimate 
as of december  and  trh s carried loss and lae reserves  net of related reinsurance recoverable  were billion and billion  respectively  and were equal to the actuarial point estimate 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves when actual costs differ from those costs implied by the assumptions used to test the loss reserves 
this is particularly true for assumed reinsurance of long tail casualty classes 
among the most critical assumptions are those made for elrs and loss development factors 
trh s annual loss reserve review for did not include the calculation of a range of loss reserve estimates 
because management does not believe it can currently assign credible probabilistic values to a range  a better understanding of the volatility of loss reserve estimates can be gained via an analysis of the sensitivity of these estimates to changes in the critical assumptions used in the loss reserve review process as opposed to creating a range during the loss reserve review process 
an analysis of the sensitivity of the loss reserve indications to these key assumptions can be performed by measuring the effect of various changes to the assumptions utilized in the reviews 
the assumptions made regarding factors considered in the sensitivity analysis  such as loss trends  elrs and loss development factors  are generally consistent with trh s historical experience 
loss development factors  for example  which are used to project reported paid and incurred losses to an ultimate incurred loss  are selected based on the curves fitted to the historical averages which best represent the data 
elrs are based on the ultimate loss ratios for the more mature years adjusted for changes in the rate levels and other quantifiable factors to enable the elrs to remain consistent with historical experience 
in general  it is believed that the vast majority of potential volatility in the loss reserves results from the longer tailed lines of business 
for the purpose of these sensitivity analyses  only ibnr loss reserves from these longer tailed lines  which represent approximately of total ibnr loss reserves at december   were included in the calculations 
additionally  only those underwriting years where it is believed reasonable for deviations from the original assumptions to occur were utilized 
generally  the last years were included in the analysis 
the results derived from the sensitivity analyses are roughly the same whether utilizing unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses gross loss reserves or net loss reserves 

table of contents while noting that there exists the potential for greater variations  trh believes utilizing and changes to the assumptions made for both loss development factors and elrs provide reasonable benchmarks for a sensitivity analysis of the loss reserve estimates at december  for example  changing the elrs by percentage points has an impact of about million either positively or negatively on the loss reserve estimate 
while less likely for many classes of business  trh notes that changing the elrs by percentage points has an effect of about million 
as previously described  another key assumption is the selection of loss development patterns 
the effect of increasing the tail on the selected loss development patterns by is about million 
similarly  a deviation would impact the reserve estimate by about million 
because a downward adjustment to the loss development patterns can result in implied negative future development on reported losses for certain years  this scenario is not believed to be as likely as that of an upward deviation of this amount 
due to the assumptions and methodologies utilized by trh in its reviews of longer tailed classes of business  changes to the elrs generally have a much greater impact on the assessment of loss reserves for the most recent few underwriting years while deviations from the loss development factors utilized in the reviews generally are more critical to the loss reserve indications for older underwriting years ie  and prior 
management believes that it is reasonable to simultaneously vary both of the assumptions previously discussed by and 
the effect of varying these assumptions together by is about million 
increasing these assumptions by simultaneously adds approximately billion to the reserve estimates  although management considers this scenario to be significantly less likely than the scenario previously discussed 
trh also notes that the classes of business for which these assumptions are most critical are medical malpractice  d o  e o and excess casualty 
net loss reserves include amounts for risks relating to environmental impairment and asbestos related illnesses 
the majority of trh s environmental and asbestos related net loss reserves arose from contracts entered into after that were underwritten specifically as environmental or asbestos related coverages rather than as standard general liability coverages  where the environmental or asbestos related liabilities were neither clearly defined nor specifically excluded 
the reserves carried for these claims  including losses and lae ibnr  are based upon known facts and current law 
however  significant uncertainty exists in determining the amount of ultimate liability for environmental impairment and asbestos related losses  particularly for those occurring in and prior 
this uncertainty is due to inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations with respect to underlying policy intent and coverage and uncertainties as to the allocation of responsibility for resultant damages  among other things 
see discussion of net development on losses occurring in prior years which includes a discussion of the causative factors of such net development under results of operations and further information about gross loss reserves under financial condition and liquidity 
b fair value measurements of certain financial assets trh measures at fair value on a recurring basis financial instruments included principally in its available for sale securities portfolios and certain short term investments 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing  able and knowledgeable market participants at the measurement date 
the degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates with the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments traded in other than active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment 
an active market is one in which transactions for the asset being valued occurs with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
an other than active market is 
table of contents one in which there are few transactions  the prices are not current  price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers  or in which little information is released publicly for the asset being valued 
pricing observability is affected by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established  the characteristics specific to the transaction and general market conditions 
trh management is responsible for the determination of the value of the financial assets carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions 
with respect to securities  trh employs independent third party valuation service providers to gather  analyze and interpret market information and derive fair values based upon relevant methodologies and assumptions for individual instruments 
when trh s valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security  fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a quote  which is generally non binding  or by employing widely accepted internal valuation models 
valuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and  through the use of widely accepted internal valuation models  provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of service agreements 
the inputs used by the valuation service providers include  but are not limited to  market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities  interest rate yield curves  credit spreads  currency rates  and other market observable information  as applicable 
the valuation models take into account  among other things  market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term  interest rate  credit rating  industry sector  and when applicable  collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information 
when market transactions or other market observable data is limited  the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased 
trh employs specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair values of trh s financial assets 
trh s processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques utilized are appropriate  consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value 
trh assesses the reasonableness of individual security values received from valuation service providers through various analytical techniques 
in addition  trh may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from trh s valuation service providers to other third party valuation sources for selected securities 
trh also validates prices for selected securities obtained from brokers through reviews by those who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions 
as of december   of trh s billion of available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities and other invested assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis  billion was based on prices received from independent pricing services and billion was based on non binding broker quotes or internal valuation sources 
fair values from all external sources are reviewed by management  but none were adjusted 
through june   the aig group managed the investments and performed investment recordkeeping and the above valuation services for trh 
effective july   trh employs third parties not affiliated with aig to provide these services 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements note for discussion of how trh determines the fair value of its fixed maturities available for sale  equities available for sale and certain short term investments 

table of contents fair value hierarchy and level assets assets recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three levels based on the observability of inputs available in the market place used to measure the fair value 
see note for additional information about fair value measurements 
the valuation of level assets requires the greatest degree of judgment  as these measurements may be made under circumstances in which there is little  if any  market activity for the asset 
at december   trh classified million of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as level this represented of total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
level fair value measurements are based on valuation techniques that use at least one significant input that is unobservable 
trh s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment 
in making the assessment  trh considers factors specific to the asset 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
trh values its assets classified as level using judgment and valuation models or other pricing techniques that require a variety of inputs including contractual terms  market prices and rates  yield curves  credit curves  measures of volatility  prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs  some of which may be unobservable 
the following paragraphs describe the methods trh uses to measure on a recurring basis the fair value of the most significant types of assets classified as level certain residential mortgage backed securities rmbs and commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs these assets initially are valued at the transaction price 
subsequently  they may be valued by comparison to transactions in instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles  remittances received and updated cumulative loss data on underlying obligations  discounted cash flow techniques and or option adjusted spread analyses 
certain other asset backed securities non mortgage these assets initially are valued at the transaction price 
subsequently  they may be valued based on external price spread data 
when position specific external price data are not observable  the valuation is based on prices of comparable securities 
other invested assets fair values for other invested assets  principally direct equity investments and alternative investments  are initially valued at the transaction price 
subsequently  fair value is based on the net asset value or financial statement information of the investee 
c otti of investments see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements note g for the criteria trh uses to evaluate if an investment is a candidate for otti 
the determination that a security has incurred otti in value requires the judgment of management and consideration of the fundamental condition of the issuer  its near term prospects and all the relevant facts and circumstances 
there can  however  be no assurance that trh has accurately assessed the level of impairments reflected in its financial statements 
furthermore  additional impairments may need to be taken in the future 
historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments 

table of contents at december   trh had gross unrealized losses on all fixed maturities including fixed maturities classified as held to maturity and equities totaling million which did not meet the criteria for otti 
if trh s determination of otti is materially incorrect  it could have a material adverse effect on trh s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
d premium revenues management must make certain judgments in the determination of premiums written and earned by trh 
for pro rata treaty contracts  premiums written and earned are based on reports received from ceding companies 
for excess of loss treaty contracts  premiums are generally recorded as written based on contract terms and are earned ratably over the terms of the related coverages provided 
in recent years  treaty contracts have generated approximately of trh s premium revenues 
unearned premiums and prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the portion of gross premiums written and ceded premiums written  respectively  relating to the unexpired terms of such coverages 
the relationship between net premiums written and net premiums earned will  therefore  vary depending generally on the volume and inception dates of the business assumed and ceded and the mix of such business between pro rata and excess of loss reinsurance 
premiums written and earned  along with related costs  for which data has not been reported by the ceding companies  are estimated based on historical patterns and other relevant information 
such estimates of premiums earned are considered when establishing the reserve for loss and lae ibnr 
the differences between these estimates and the actual data subsequently reported  which may be material as a result of the diversity of cedants and reporting practices and the inherent difficulty in estimating premium inflows  among other factors  are recorded in the period when the actual data become available and may materially affect results of operations 
in the consolidated statements of operations  premiums written and earned and the change in unearned premiums are presented net of reinsurance ceded 

table of contents trh s financial statements reflected estimates of gross premiums written  commissions and premium balances receivable  for which data had as yet to be reported by cedants as of december  and  as follows major class gross premiums written commissions premiums balances receivable in thousands casualty other liability accident and health medical malpractice ocean marine and aviation auto liability surety and credit other total casualty property fire allied lines auto physical damage homeowners multiple peril other total property total major class gross premiums written commissions premiums balances receivable in thousands casualty other liability accident and health medical malpractice ocean marine and aviation auto liability surety and credit other total casualty property fire allied lines auto physical damage homeowners multiple peril other total property total 
table of contents trh has provided no allowance for bad debts relating to the premium estimates based on its historical experience  the general profile of its cedants and the ability trh has in most cases to significantly offset these premium receivables with losses and lae or other amounts payable to the same parties 
e deferred acquisition costs acquisition costs  consisting primarily of net commissions incurred on business conducted through reinsurance contracts or certificates  are deferred and then amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned  generally one year 
the evaluation of recoverability of acquisition costs to be deferred considers the expected profitability of the underlying treaties and facultative certificates  which may vary materially from actual results 
if the actual profitability varies from the expected profitability  the impact of such differences is recorded  as appropriate  when actual results become known and may have a material effect on results of operations 
operational review results of operations trh derives its revenue from two principal sources premiums from reinsurance assumed net of reinsurance ceded ie  net premiums earned and income from investments

overall premium growth in was mitigated by increased ceding company retentions in certain lines and price erosion in many classes and regions in and the first half of in and  as compared to the respective immediately prior year  the changes in net premiums written were primarily from treaty business

generally  reasons for changes in gross premiums written between years are similar to those for net premiums written  except for changes in ceded premiums  including premiums assumed from a subsidiary of aig that  by prearrangement  were ceded in an equal amount to other subsidiaries of aig see note of notes to consolidated financial statements note 
the majority of the decrease in premiums ceded in compared to is due to a decrease in premiums assumed from a subsidiary of aig that  by prearrangement with trh  were then ceded in an equal amount to other subsidiaries of aig 
the increase in premiums ceded to related parties in compared to is due principally to an increase in premiums assumed from a subsidiary of aig that  by prearrangement with trh  were then ceded in an equal amount to other subsidiaries of aig 
the decrease in premiums ceded to non related parties in compared to is due in part to the purchase of less retrocession coverage 
as further discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  trh transacts business assumed and ceded with the aig group and either accepts or rejects the proposed transactions with such companies based on its assessment of risk selection  pricing  terms and conditions  among other factors 
as premiums written are primarily earned ratably over the terms of the related coverage  the reasons for changes in net premiums earned are generally similar to the reasons for changes in net premiums written over time

net investment income in decreased compared to due to a decrease in investment results from other invested assets of million  principally related to alternative investments  partially offset by an increase in investment income from fixed maturities 
the decrease in investment income from alternative investments was due in part to the recent turmoil in the financial markets 
the increase in investment income from fixed maturities is due in part to investment returns from continued positive operating cash flows 
see note d of notes to consolidated financial statements for a breakdown of the components of net investment income and the cash flow discussion under financial condition and liquidity

see note e for a breakdown of realized net capital losses gains 
realized net capital losses in included million of otti write downs charged to earnings  due in large part to the continued depressed fair values of certain securities and issuer specific credit 
table of contents events 
otti decreased in compared to as financial and credit markets stabilized and partially recovered from the turmoil at the end of realized net capital losses in included million of net losses on sales and redemptions of securities and million of otti write downs 
the significant realized net capital losses from sales and redemptions of securities and otti write downs in generally resulted from declines in the fair values of securities and issuer specific credit events due to the downturn in the us economy  turmoil in the financial markets and financial market illiquidity in upon the ultimate disposition of securities for which write downs have been recorded  a portion of the write downs may be recoverable depending on market conditions at the time of disposition 
see note g for the criteria used in the determination of such write downs

under such program  trh loaned securities to counterparties and received collateral  generally cash  which was invested to earn a spread 
the collateral was returned to the counterparties when the loaned securities were returned to trh at a future date 
in the fourth quarter of  trh terminated its participation in the securities lending program 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the transfers of securities in exchange for collateral under the securities lending program were accounted for as secured borrowings 
securities lending invested collateral was shown on the balance sheet at fair value 
a liability was recorded in an amount equal to the collateral received  reflecting trh s obligation to return the collateral when the loaned securities were returned

table of contents included in net investment income 
as a result of conditions affecting the financial and credit markets  in the fourth quarter of  counterparties were successful in negotiating significantly reduced collateral levels ie  collateral received as a percentage of the fair value of the security loaned 
due to the lower collateral levels  during the fourth quarter of  many of such loaned securities were accounted for as sales at the time of transfer and as purchases when the securities were subsequently returned 
the financial impact on the statement of operations of the securities lending program was as follows with respect to securities lending invested collateral net investment income from the securities lending program ie  income earned on invested collateral  net of interest payable to the collateral provider totaled million and million in and  respectively  net realized losses on sales of securities lending invested collateral totaled million and million in and  respectively  otti write downs included in realized net capital losses totaled million in and nil in with respect to the securities loaned  realized losses in the fourth quarter of on deemed sales of securities loaned totaled million

in that regard  certain fixed maturities  including cmbs  rmbs and other asset backed securities were transferred from securities lending invested collateral to fixed maturities available for sale 
in and  trh repurchased portions of its senior notes due in the notes from non related parties as detailed below in millions principal amount repurchased repurchase price gain on early extinguishment of debt the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries use the combined ratio as a measure of underwriting profitability 
the combined ratio reflects only underwriting results and does not include income from investments 
generally  a combined ratio under indicates an underwriting profit and a combined ratio exceeding indicates an underwriting loss 
underwriting profitability is subject to significant fluctuations due to competition  natural and man made catastrophic events  economic and social conditions  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  interest rates and other factors 
trh s combined ratio and its components  for all periods in this form k  are presented in accordance with the methodology commonly used by insurance industry analysts and trh s peers 
the combined ratio represents the sum of the loss ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
the loss ratio represents net losses and lae incurred expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the underwriting expense ratio represents the sum of the commission ratio and the other underwriting expense ratio 
the commission ratio represents the sum of net commissions and the decrease increase in deferred acquisition costs expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the other underwriting expense ratio represents other underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned

see discussion in catastrophe exposure of the magnitude of trh s catastrophe exposures 

table of contents while trh believes that it has taken appropriate steps to manage its exposure to possible future catastrophe losses  the occurrence of one or more natural or man made catastrophic events of unanticipated frequency or severity  such as a terrorist attack  earthquake or hurricane  that causes insured losses could have a material adverse effect on trh s results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
current techniques and models may not accurately predict the probability of catastrophic events in the future and the extent of the resulting losses 
moreover  one or more catastrophe losses could weaken trh s retrocessionnaires and result in an inability of trh to collect reinsurance recoverables 
in addition  in  trh decreased its estimates of the ultimate amounts of net losses occurring in and prior years by million

see note for amounts included in net favorable development that relate to catastrophe losses 
the favorable development in through results generally from favorable loss trends 
the net adverse development arising from losses occurring in and prior generally relates to various excess casualty lines such as general liability and excess umbrella liability which were impacted by late reported high layer excess claims 
ceding companies and their reinsurers continue to experience increased loss costs relative to expectations as loss emergence patterns continue to lengthen as regards the soft market years of through trh writes a significant amount of non proportional assumed casualty reinsurance as well as proportional assumed reinsurance of excess liability business for such volatile classes as medical malpractice  d o  e o and general casualty 
at the primary level  there are significant risk factors which contribute to the variability and unpredictability of the loss trend factor for this business such as jury awards  social inflation  medical inflation  tort reforms and court interpretations of coverage 
in addition  as a reinsurer  trh is also highly dependent upon the claims reserving and reporting practices of its cedants  which vary greatly by size  specialization and country of origin and whose practices are subject to change without notice 

table of contents based on information presently available  trh s current loss reserves represent management s best estimate of ultimate losses  but there can be no assurance that trh s loss reserves will not develop adversely due to  for example  the inherent volatility in loss trend factors and variability of reporting practices for those classes  among other factors  and materially exceed the carried loss reserves as of december  and thus  have a material adverse effect on future net income  financial condition and cash flows

the favorable development in through results generally from favorable loss trends 
the net adverse development arising from losses occurring in years through  which represent the great majority of the and prior development  generally relates to the fact that for many classes within 
table of contents these years  ceding companies continue to experience increased loss costs relative to expectations  coupled with an unexpected lengthening of the loss emergence patterns 
generally  loss activity was greater than expected from losses occurring in the d o and e o classes  although to a lesser extent than in previous calendar year periods 
also  classes such as medical malpractice and excess umbrella were impacted by late reported high layer excess claims to a greater extent than expected 
contributing to this increase  is the fact that many policies during this period covered underlying contracts that extended over multiple years  which contributed to recent reported loss activity exceeding previous expectations 
this has led to an increase in both the frequency and severity of claims entering the reinsured excess of loss coverage layers at later points in time than had previously been experienced

federal and foreign income tax benefit expense of million  million and million were recorded in  and  respectively 
the tax benefit  which exceeds the income before income taxes in  resulted from the tax benefit generated by the significant amount of realized net capital losses occurring during the year  including the tax benefit on million of tax capital loss carrybacks to prior years  in addition to the customary tax benefits associated with tax exempt interest and the dividends received deduction

non gaap measures the performance of trh is commonly assessed by analysts and others based on performance measures which are not defined under gaap 
those measures include net operating income noi  noi per common share diluted and operating return on equity operating roe 
noi is defined as gaap net income loss excluding realized net capital gains losses and gain on early extinguishment of debt  net of taxes 
noi per common share diluted represents noi divided by average common shares outstanding on a diluted basis 
operating roe is defined as noi divided by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity 
in addition  gaap return on equity gaap roe is defined as gaap net income divided by the average of beginning and ending stockholders equity 
trh uses these measures in analyzing its performance as these measures focus on the core fundamentals of trh s operations 
while trh considers realized capital gains losses and the gain on early extinguishment of debt as integral parts of its business and results  such items are not indicative of the core fundamentals of trh s operations 
trh believes these measures are of interest to the investment community because they provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of trh s operating performance from period to period on bases that are not otherwise apparent under gaap

trh does not anticipate any material capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
while the expected payout pattern of liabilities see the contractual obligations table later in this section is considered in the investment management process  it is not the only factor considered as trh has historically funded its claims payments from current operating cash flows 
as a result of such funding history  trh has not historically maintained a credit facility  though it may do so in the future 
trh s primary investment goal is to optimize after tax income through a high quality diversified taxable fixed maturity and tax exempt municipal fixed maturity portfolio  while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity 
see discussion later in this section of the potential liquidity strain that could arise as a result of significant acceleration of paid losses beyond trh s ability to fund such cash needs

through  trh participated in the securities lending program  whereby certain securities principally fixed maturities available for sale from its portfolio were loaned to third parties 
under such program  trh loaned securities to counterparties and received collateral  generally cash  which was invested to earn a spread 
the collateral received was invested in separate portfolios containing floating rate bonds ie  fixed maturities  including asset backed securities  and interest bearing cash equivalents 
these portfolios were maintained in segregated accounts for trh by the program manager 
the collateral was returned to the counterparties when the loaned securities were returned to trh at a future date 
in the fourth quarter of  trh terminated its participation in the securities lending program 
prior to the fourth quarter of  the transfers of securities in exchange for collateral under the securities lending program were accounted for as secured borrowings 
securities lending invested collateral was shown on the balance sheet at fair value 
a liability was recorded in an amount equal to the collateral received  reflecting trh s obligation to return the collateral when the loaned securities were returned 
income earned on invested collateral  net of interest payable to the collateral provider  was included in net investment income 
as a result of conditions affecting the financial and credit markets  in the fourth quarter of  counterparties were successful in negotiating significantly reduced collateral levels ie  collateral received as a percentage of the fair value of the security loaned 
due to the lower collateral levels  during the fourth quarter of  many of such loaned securities were accounted for as sales at the time of transfer and as purchases when the securities were subsequently returned

see note net loss reserves totaled billion at december   an increase of million  or  from the prior year end

net loss reserves include amounts for risks relating to environmental impairment and asbestos related illnesses totaling million and million at december  and  respectively  including million and million at the aforementioned dates  respectively  relating to such losses occurring in and prior 
as trc  the major operating subsidiary of the company  commenced operations in  the great majority of trh s environmental and asbestos related net loss reserves arose from contracts entered into after that were underwritten specifically as environmental or asbestos related coverages rather than as standard general liability coverages  where the environmental or asbestos related liabilities were neither clearly defined nor specifically excluded 
the reserves carried for these claims  including ibnr reserves  are based upon known facts and current law 
however  significant uncertainty exists in determining the amount of ultimate liability for environmental impairment and asbestos related losses  particularly for those occurring in and prior 
this uncertainty is due to inconsistent court resolutions and judicial interpretations with respect to underlying policy intent and coverage and uncertainties as to the allocation of responsibility for resultant damages  among other things 
because the reserving process is inherently difficult and subjective  actual losses may materially differ from reserves and related reinsurance recoverables reflected in trh s consolidated financial statements  and  accordingly  may have a material effect on future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
and while there is also the possibility of changes in statutes  laws  regulations and other factors that could have a material effect on these liabilities and  accordingly  the financial statement elements cited immediately above  trh believes that its loss reserves carried at december  are adequate 
see critical accounting estimates for a discussion of the significant assumptions and factors considered in the reserve setting process 

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  trh is involved in lawsuits  arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute resolution procedures  the outcomes of which will determine trh s rights and obligations under reinsurance agreements and other more general contracts 
in some disputes  trh seeks to enforce its rights under an agreement or to collect funds owing to it 
in other matters  trh is resisting attempts by others to enforce alleged rights 
such disputes are resolved through formal and informal means  including litigation  arbitration and mediation 
see item legal proceedings 
in all such matters  trh believes that its positions are legally and commercially reasonable 
trh also regularly evaluates those positions  and where appropriate  establishes or adjusts loss reserves to reflect its evaluation 
trh s aggregate loss reserves take into account the possibility that trh may not ultimately prevail in each and every disputed matter 
trh takes into consideration changes in judicial interpretation of legal liability and policy coverages  changes in claims handling practices and inflation 
trh considers not only monetary increases in the cost of what it reinsures  but also changes in societal factors that influence jury verdicts and case law  trh s approach to claim resolution  and  in turn  claim costs 
trh believes its aggregate loss reserves reduce the potential that an adverse resolution of one or more of these matters  at any point in time  would have a material impact on trh s financial condition or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that adverse resolutions of such matters in any one period or in the aggregate will not result in a material adverse effect on trh s results of operations or financial condition 
for  trh s net operating cash inflows were million  a decrease of million from the decrease results  in large part  from a decrease in cash received from underwriting activities 
for  trh s net operating cash inflows totaled billion  an increase of million from the increase is due in large part to decreased income taxes paid and an increase in investment income received  partially offset by decreased cash flows from underwriting activities  including decreased collection of reinsurance recoverable 
as significant losses from catastrophes occurring in prior years remain unpaid  trh expects that payments relating to these events will negatively impact operating cash flows in and perhaps thereafter 
if paid losses accelerated significantly beyond trh s ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows  trh would be compelled to liquidate a portion of its investment portfolio and or arrange for financing 
such events that may cause such a liquidity strain could be the result of several catastrophic events occurring in a relatively short period of time 
additional strain on liquidity could occur if the investments sold to fund such cash needs were sold in a depressed marketplace and or reinsurance recoverable on paid losses became uncollectible 
based on its history of consistently strong operating cash flows  the present composition of its investment portfolio including present levels of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and other liquid investment classes and consideration of its cash needs  trh considers its liquidity to be adequate through the end of and thereafter for a period the length of which is difficult to predict  but which trh believes will be at least one year

catastrophe exposure the nature of trh s business exposes it to losses from various catastrophe events 
in a catastrophe event  losses from many insureds across multiple lines of business may result directly or indirectly from such single occurrence 
in order to control such exposures  trh employs a combination of measures  including setting targets for the amount of its exposure in key geographic zones and product lines that are prone to catastrophic events  monitoring and modeling accumulated exposures and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance when deemed cost effective 

table of contents natural disasters such as hurricanes  earthquakes and other catastrophes have the potential to adversely affect trh s operating results by material amounts 
other risks  such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease  a major terrorist event  the bankruptcy of a major company  or a marine and or aviation disaster  could also have a materially adverse effect on trh s business and operating results to an extent that may be only partially offset by reinsurance 
trh evaluates catastrophic events and assesses the probability of occurrence and magnitude through the use of industry recognized models and other techniques 
trh supplements these models by periodically monitoring the exposure risks of its operations and adjusting such modeled output accordingly 
it is important to recognize that there is no single standard methodology to project the possible losses from catastrophe exposures 
further  there are no industry standard assumptions to be utilized in projecting these losses and the form and quality of the data obtained from ceding companies used in these models are not uniformly compatible with the data requirements of all models 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses 
therefore  these modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies 
while the analytical tools used to estimate catastrophe exposure are useful in both pricing and monitoring catastrophe risk  the estimates derived by use of these techniques are inherently uncertain and do not reflect trh s maximum exposures to these events 
while the models are frequently updated  these projections are nevertheless inherently imprecise 
it is highly likely that trh s losses will vary  perhaps materially  from these estimates 
projections of potential catastrophe losses are typically expressed in terms of the probable maximum loss pml 
trh defines pml as its anticipated maximum loss taking into account contract limits caused by a single catastrophic event affecting a broad contiguous area 
these modeled losses are estimated based upon contracts in force at january  the following is an overview of such modeled pmls from property  engineering  marine and energy exposures and the associated natural perils that trh deems most significant 
the estimated amount of these modeled losses are presented in three ways a gross losses  b pre tax net catastrophe costs ie  gross losses  net of reinsurance and the impact of net reinstatement premiums  and c after tax net catastrophe costs ie  the net cost to trh 
the reduction for reinsurance assumes that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to trh in accordance with contract terms 
the values provided have a likelihood of being exceeded in any single year of or 
gross losses pre tax net catastrophe costs after tax net catastrophe costs gross losses pre tax net catastrophe costs after tax net catastrophe costs in millions europe  wind florida  wind california  earthquake northeast us  wind japan  earthquake europe  wind has the highest modeled after tax net catastrophe costs arising out of events with a probability of being exceeded and would represent of trh s stockholders equity at december  northeast us  wind has the highest modeled after tax net catastrophe costs arising out of events with a probability of being exceeded and would represent of trh s stockholders equity at december  if multiple severe catastrophic events occur in any one year  the potential economic cost to the company could be materially higher than any one of the amounts shown above 

table of contents there is much uncertainty and imprecision in the compilation of these estimates at many stages in the process 
moreover  the makeup of trh s in force business is constantly changing as new business is added and existing contracts terminate or expire  including contracts for reinsurance coverage purchased by trh 
in addition  these estimates take into account what trh believes to be the most likely accumulation of territories and or lines of business in a catastrophic natural peril event  but there can be no assurance that trh has captured every possible scenario in its analysis 
as a result of these factors  among others  there can be no assurance that trh will not experience after tax net catastrophe costs from individual events that will exceed these estimates by a material amount 
there also can be no assurance that trh will not experience catastrophe events more frequently than the modeled probabilities would suggest 
in any given year  catastrophe events could have a material adverse effect on trh s financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity 
see note for catastrophe costs incurred in  and disruption in global credit and financial markets in mid  the us residential mortgage market began to experience serious disruption due to credit quality deterioration in a significant portion of loans originated  particularly to non prime and sub prime borrowers  evolving changes in the regulatory environment  a residential housing market characterized by a slowing pace of transactions and declining prices  increased cost of borrowings for mortgage participants  a rising unemployment rate  increased delinquencies in non mortgage consumer credit  and illiquid credit markets 
in addition  the financial strength of certain bond insurers has been compromised to varying degrees by losses these entities experienced due in part to the coverage they provide for domestic rmbs 
these conditions continued through and into  expanding into the broader global credit markets and resulting in greater volatility  a steep decline in equity markets  less liquidity  widening of credit spreads  a lack of price transparency  increased credit losses in certain markets and the collapse of several prominent financial institutions 
by the end of  the disruptions to the global credit and financial markets had moderated as the markets started to stabilize or  in some cases  recover 
trh cannot predict whether current trends will continue  deteriorate or improve 
these issues carry risk relating to certain lines of business trh underwrites because disruption in the credit and financial markets may increase claim activity in lines such as d o  e o  credit  and to a limited extent mortgage guaranty business  among others 
trh also participates in the mortgage market through investments in mortgage backed securities 
the operating results and financial condition of trh have been and may continue to be adversely affected by factors related to the market disruptions referred to above  among others 
the duration and severity of the downward cycle could extend further if there is an increase in the severity of the economic difficulties being experienced around the world  including the us trh expects that the difficulties in the economy may continue to have an adverse effect on trh s operating results in the future 
trh also incurred realized and unrealized market valuation losses in  and on its available for sale securities  including asset backed fixed maturities 
the impact on trh s operations with exposure to the residential mortgage market will be somewhat dependent on future market conditions 
trh s operating results  investment portfolio and overall consolidated financial condition could be further adversely impacted if global economic conditions deteriorate in the future  although trh attempts to mitigate these  as well as other financial and operational risks  by disciplined underwriting of a diversified book of business  generally conservative investment strategies and risk management 
while trh cannot predict with any certainty the ultimate impact the recent economic deterioration will have on trh  these events may have a material adverse effect on trh s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and the company s stock price

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk trh s operations are exposed to market risk 
market risk is the risk of loss of fair value resulting from adverse fluctuations in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
trh s market risk exposures arise from the following trh is a globally diversified enterprise with capital employed in a variety of currencies 
the large amount of trh s capital invested in fixed income or equity securities 
trh analyzes market risk using value at risk var 
var is a summary statistical measure that applies the estimated volatility and correlation of market factors of trh s market position 
the output from the var calculation is the maximum loss that could occur over a defined period of time given a certain probability 
var measures not only the size of the individual exposures but also the interaction between different market exposures  thereby providing a portfolio approach to measuring market risk 
while var models are relatively sophisticated  the quantitative market risk information generated is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related models 
trh believes that statistical models alone do not provide a reliable method of monitoring and controlling market risk 
therefore  such models are tools and do not substitute for the experience or judgment of senior management 
trh has performed var analyses to estimate the maximum potential loss of fair value for financial instruments for each type of market risk 
in this analysis  financial instrument assets include all investments  cash and accrued investment income 
financial instrument liabilities include unpaid losses and lae and unearned premiums  each net of reinsurance  and the senior notes 
trh calculated the var with respect to net fair values at each quarter end in and the var number represents the maximum potential loss as of those dates that could be incurred with a confidence ie  only of historical scenarios show losses greater than the var figures within a one month holding period 
starting in the second quarter of  trh refined the calculations of var compared to prior periods 
for the values calculated as of december   september  and june  september  and june  are not presented herein  but included in the calculation of the average  high and low values for the year ended december   trh employed a variance covariance methodology that entails modeling the linear sensitivities of all the assets and liabilities to a broad set of systematic market risk factors and idiosyncratic risk factors 
risk factor returns are assumed to be joint normally distributed 
the most recent two years of historical changes in these risk factors are utilized 
information prior to second quarter that was utilized in calculating the information presented below have been calculated using the historical simulation methodology 
trh does not believe that the differences between methods materially affect an evaluation of the potential impact that market risk may have on trh 
trh expects to use the variance covariance methodology for future period data 
trh s market risk analyses do not provide weight to risks relating to market issues such as liquidity and the credit worthiness of investments 

table of contents the following table presents the year end  average  high and low vars on a diversified basis and of each component of market risk for and the diversified var is usually smaller than the sum of its components due to correlation effects
