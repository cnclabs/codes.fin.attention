through our ecost 
com business unit  we are also a leading multi category online discount retailer of new  close out and recertified brand name merchandise 
we 
table of contents derive our revenues from three business segments ecommerce and business process outsourcing  master distribution and online discount retailing 
first  in our ecommerce and business process outsourcing business segment  we derive our revenues from a broad range of services  including professional consulting  technology collaboration  order management  managed web hosting and web development  the deployment of an ecommerce technology platform  customer relationship management  financial services including billing and collection services and working capital solutions  kitting and assembly services  information management and international fulfillment and distribution services 
we offer our services as an integrated solution  which enables our clients to outsource their complete infrastructure needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies 
our distribution services are conducted at warehouses we lease or manage and include real time inventory management and customized picking  packing and shipping of our clients customer orders 
we currently provide infrastructure and distribution solutions to clients that operate in a range of vertical markets  including technology manufacturing  computer products  cosmetics  fragile goods  contemporary home furnishings  apparel  aviation  telecommunications and consumer electronics  among others 
in this ecommerce and business process outsourcing segment  we do not own the underlying inventory or the resulting accounts receivable  but provide management services for these client owned assets 
we typically charge our service fee revenue on a cost plus basis  a percent of shipped revenue basis or a per transaction basis  such as a per minute basis for web enabled customer contact center services and a per item basis for fulfillment services 
additional fees are billed for other services 
we price our services based on a variety of factors  including the depth and complexity of the services provided  the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required  the length of contract and other factors 
many of our service fee contracts involve third party vendors who provide additional services such as package delivery 
the costs we are charged by these third party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients 
our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other out of pocket expenses include travel  shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass through revenue 
our second business segment is a product revenue model 
in this segment  we are a master distributor of product for ips and certain other clients 
in this capacity  we purchase  and thus own  inventory and recognize the corresponding product revenue 
as a result  upon the sale of inventory  we own the accounts receivable 
freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue 
this business segment requires significant working capital requirements  for which we have senior credit facilities to provide for approximately million of available financing 
our third business segment is a web commerce product revenue model focused on the sale of products to a broad range of consumer and business customers 
in this segment we operate as a multi category online discount retailer of new  close out and recertified brand name merchandise 
our product line currently offers approximately  products in several primary merchandise categories  primarily including computers  networking  electronics and entertainment  tv s  monitors and projectors  cameras and camcorders  memory and storage  for the home and sports and leisure 
growth is a key element to achieving our future goals  including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability 
growth in our ecommerce and business process outsourcing segment is driven by two main elements new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients 
we focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand name companies within two primary target markets  online brands and retailers and technology manufacturers  which  by nature  require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements 
growth within our product revenue business is primarily driven by our ability to attract new master distributor arrangements with ips or other manufacturers and the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners 
growth within our web commerce product revenue model is primarily driven by ecost s ability to increase sales by generating organic growth  new customers and expanding its product line 

table of contents we continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability 
while we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield increased gross profit  we also expect to incur incremental investments to implement new contracts  investments in infrastructure and sales and marketing to support our targeted growth and increased public company professional fees 
our expenses comprise primarily four categories cost of product revenue  cost of service fee revenue  cost of pass through revenue and operating expenses 
cost of product revenue consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs  which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses 
these reimbursable expenses include pass through customer marketing programs  direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids  the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the master distributor agreements 
vendor marketing programs  such as co op advertising  also reduce cost of product revenue 
cost of service fee revenue consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web enabled customer contact center services  international fulfillment and distribution services and professional consulting services  and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts  including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
cost of pass through revenue the related reimbursable costs for pass through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass through revenue 
operating expenses consist primarily of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff  advertising  online marketing and catalog production  distribution costs excluding freight applicable to the supplies distributors and ecost businesses  executive  management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs  including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
monitoring and controlling our available cash balances continues to be a primary focus 
our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth 
in recent years we have added to our available cash and liquidity positions through various transactions  including working capital financing agreements for our primary operating subsidiaries and through sales of our common stock through private placement transactions

product revenue  net 
ecost product revenue was million in  a decrease as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to an overall decline in sales in both its business to business bb channel and business to consumer bc channel during the period primarily resulting from the impact of the global economic environment 
supplies distributors product revenue of million decreased million  or in as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to decreased sales volume resulting from the impact of overall global economic pressures  inventory rationalization by customers  reduced ibm and ips printer installations in certain categories as well as the negative impact of foreign exchange rates compared to the same period in the prior year 
we currently expect our total annual product revenue to remain relatively stable or increase moderately from levels as global economic conditions improve 

table of contents service fee revenue 
the decrease in service fee revenue for the year ended december  was primarily due to the non renewal of a certain us government agency client relationship  which ended in early  partially offset by increased service fees generated from the impact of new service contract relationships 
the change in service fee revenue  excluding pass through revenue  is shown below millions year ended december  new service contract relationships  including certain incremental projects under new contracts change in existing client service fees terminated clients not included in revenue year ended december  the million reduction of service fee revenue that resulted from the non renewal of the us government agency client is included in the change in existing client service fees line item above as there was activity with this client in each of the years ended december  and the service fee revenue for the year ended december  includes approximately million of revenue with clients that terminated during  including the us government agency contract 
however  based on historical activity and current projection of existing clients  including new clients signed in and  net of the impact from the non renewal of certain clients  we currently anticipate that service fee revenue will increase from service fee revenue levels 
cost of product revenue 
the gross margin for ecost was million or of product revenue in and million or of product revenue during gross margin for ecost increased from the prior year primarily due to the customer mix  which included a larger percentage of sales to the higher margin business to consumer channel compared to the same period last year 
we are targeting an increasing percentage of ecost revenues to be generated from the business to consumer channel  yet we continue to strive to improve our product sales and gross margin in our business to business channel 
supplies distributors cost of product revenue decreased by million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of decreased product sales 
the resulting gross profit margin was million or of product revenue for the year ended december  and million or of product revenue for the gross profit margin for and include certain incremental inventory cost adjustments 
the margin percentage reflects an increase due to incremental gross margin earned on product sales resulting from certain product price increases  which is partially offset by the impact from a customer bankruptcy during the first quarter of cost of service fee revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of service fees declined to in from in the margins include the benefit of a full year of higher margin incremental project work associated with the us government contract relationship that was not renewed and was completed in the second quarter of we target to earn an overall gross profit of on existing and new service fee contracts  but we have and may continue to accept lower gross margin percentages on certain contracts depending on contract scope and other factors 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased by million compared to operating expenses were million  or of total net revenues in the period and million  or of total net revenues in the prior year 
operating expenses in include a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of million resulting from our annual analysis required under accounting standards 
excluding the impact of the million impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets  operating expenses were of total net revenues in the period 
the remaining increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues is due to the reduction in total net revenues  which decreased at a higher rate than the reduction in operating expenses 
during  we implemented certain cost reductions  primarily personnel related adjustments  as a result of the lower service fee revenue and product revenue 

table of contents income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision associated primarily with state income taxes and our subsidiary supplies distributors canadian and european operations 
during  we recognized a tax benefit relating to our adoption of a new transfer pricing policy between certain international subsidiaries 
this policy adoption resulted from the completion of a transfer pricing study and its approval by appropriate tax regulators 
a valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our net deferred tax assets as of december  and december   which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
we expect that we will continue to record an income tax provision associated with state income taxes and supplies distributors canadian and european results of operations 
supplies distributors and its subsidiaries supplies distributors and its subsidiaries act as master distributors of various ips and other products and  pursuant to a transaction management services agreement between us and supplies distributors  we provide transaction management and fulfillment services to supplies distributors and its subsidiaries 
in addition to our equity investment in supplies distributors  we have also provided supplies distributors with a subordinated loan that  as of december   had an outstanding balance of million 
supplies distributors has paid us dividends of million and million in and  respectively 
supplies distributors has received lender approval to pay dividends of approximately million in  and to reduce its subordinated debt to us by million  but pursuant to the terms of its amended credit agreements  is restricted from paying further cash dividends without the prior approval of its lenders 
in addition  no distribution may be made if  after giving effect thereto  supplies distributors or its subsidiaries be in noncompliance with its financial covenants under its current facilities 
ecost and its subsidiaries ecost is a multi category online discount retailer of new  close out and recertified brand name merchandise  selling products primarily to customers in the united states 
as of december   we have advanced million to ecost to support its operations 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and primarily resulted from a decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and cash income before working capital changes of million partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable  deferred revenue  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million 
these changes primarily resulted from decreased working capital requirements in our supplies distributors segment related to decreased product revenues compared to net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and primarily resulted from cash income before working capital changes of million  an increase in accounts payable  deferred revenue  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in restricted cash of million  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses  other receivables and other assets of million and an increase in inventories of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively  primarily resulting from capital expenditures 
capital expenditures have historically consisted primarily of additions to upgrade our management information systems and general expansion of our facilities  both domestic and foreign  and certain technology and development costs related to new client implementations 
we expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities 
based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans  we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology services and capitalized implementation costs for the upcoming twelve months will be approximately million to million  although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients 
to maintain our current operating cash position  a portion of these expenditures may be financed through debt  operating or capital leases  additional equity or implementation fees charged to our clients 
we may elect to modify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not achieve the revenue necessary to support such investments 

table of contents net cash used in financing activities was approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily representing payments on debt and capital leases 
our liquidity has been negatively impacted as a result of the merger with ecost 
since the merger in february  ecost has experienced a net use of cash primarily due to operating losses 
as a result  we have had to support ecost s cash needs with the goal of reducing operating losses 
the amount of further cash needed to support ecost operations will depend upon the financing available as well as ecost s ability to improve its financial results 
ecost s results  excluding the impact of any non cash impairment charges  have improved in recent years  and we expect continued improvement as a result of efforts to increase sales  improve product mix and further improve operational efficiencies 
our liquidity has also been negatively impacted by a decline in service fee revenue due to the current general economic decline as well as the nonrenewal of a us government agency contract and certain other contracts 
to help minimize the impact of lower service fee revenue  we have implemented certain measures that reduced variable costs and expenses and redeployed existing infrastructure to other client activities 
no assurance can be given that a further decline in service fee revenue will not have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
during the year ended december   our working capital decreased to million from million at december   partially due to the paydown of debt facilities along with capital expenditures that were not financed through financing arrangements or client implementation fees 
working capital as of december  included the benefit from certain clients paying implementation fees in applicable to technology and development costs that will be incurred by us during to obtain additional financing in the future  in addition to our current cash position  we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity  utilizing capital or operating leases  borrowing under our credit facilities  expanding our current credit facilities  entering into new debt agreements or transferring to third parties a portion of our subordinated loan balance due from supplies distributors 
in conjunction with certain of these alternatives  we may be required to provide certain letters of credit to secure these arrangements 
no assurances can be given we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof 
we currently believe our cash position  financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations including cost reductions related to the nonrenewal of our us government contract will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs  our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  our current debt and lease obligations  and additional loans to our subsidiaries supplies distributors and ecost  if necessary  for at least the next twelve months 
during the past two years  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and foreign governments 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to renew our credit facilities 
in support of certain debt instruments and leases  as of december   we had million of cash restricted for repayment to lenders 
in addition  as described above  we have provided collateralized guarantees to secure the repayment of certain of our subsidiaries credit facilities 
many of these facilities include both financial and non financial covenants  and also include cross default provisions applicable to other credit facilities and agreements 
these covenants include minimum levels of net worth for the individual borrower subsidiaries and the parent guarantor and restrictions on the ability of the borrower subsidiaries to advance funds to other borrower subsidiaries 
as a result  it is possible for one or more of these borrower subsidiaries to fail to meet their respective covenants even if another borrower subsidiary otherwise has available excess funds which  if not restricted  could be used to cure the default 
to the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants  including the monthly financial covenant requirements and our required level of shareholders equity  and the lenders accelerate the repayment of the credit facility obligations  we would be required to repay all amounts outstanding thereunder 
in particular  in the event ecost is unable to increase its revenue and or gross profit from its present levels  or if pfs service fee revenue declines from expected levels and it is unable to reduce costs to correspond to such reduced revenue levels or if supplies distributors revenue or gross profit declines from expected levels  such events may result in a breach of one or more of the financial covenants required under their working capital lines of credit 
in such event  absent a waiver  the working capital lender would be entitled to accelerate all amounts outstanding thereunder and exercise all other rights and remedies  including sale of collateral and payment under our parent guaranty 
a requirement to 
table of contents accelerate the repayment of the credit facility obligations would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we can provide no assurance we will have the financial ability to repay all of such obligations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
further  any non renewal of any of our credit facilities would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
we do not have any other material financial commitments  although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients 
in the future  we may attempt to acquire other businesses or seek an equity or strategic partner to generate capital or expand our services or capabilities in connection with our efforts to grow our business 
acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties and may require additional financing 
therefore  we can give no assurance with respect to whether we will be successful in identifying businesses to acquire or an equity or strategic partner  whether we or they will be able to obtain financing to complete a transaction  or whether we or they will be successful in operating the acquired business 
to finance their distribution of ips products  supplies distributors and its subsidiaries have short term credit facilities with ibm credit llc ibm credit and ibm belgium financial services sa ibm belgium 
we have provided a collateralized guaranty to secure the repayment of these credit facilities 
these asset based credit facilities provided financing for up to million and up to million euros approximately million at december  with ibm credit and ibm belgium  respectively

pfsweb has guaranteed all current and future obligations of ecost under this line of credit 
we financed certain capital expenditures through a loan agreement with the mississippi business finance corporation the mbfc pursuant to which the mbfc issued mbfc taxable variable rate demand limited obligation revenue bonds  series priority fulfillment services  inc project the bonds 
the mbfc loaned us the proceeds of the bonds for the purpose of financing the acquisition and installation of equipment  machinery and related assets to support incremental business from a southaven  mississippi distribution facility 
the primary source of repayment of the bonds is a letter of credit the letter of credit issued by comerica pursuant to a reimbursement agreement between us and comerica under which we are obligated to pay to comerica all amounts drawn under the letter of credit 
the letter of credit has a maturity date of april at which time  if not renewed or replaced  will result in a draw on the undrawn face amount thereof 
the amount outstanding on the loan agreement as of december  was million 
our obligations under the reimbursement agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of our pfs subsidiary  including restricted cash of million and a parent company guarantee 
ecost has historically incurred significant operating losses and used cash to fund its operations 
as a result  we have been required to invest cash to fund ecost s operations  which we may not be able to continue to do without approval from our lenders 
the amount of further cash needed to support ecost operations depends upon the financing available under its credit line as well as ecost s ability to improve its financial results 
through march   we have advanced million to ecost to fund ecost s cash flow requirements and have lender approval to advance incremental amounts subject to certain cash inflows to pfs  as defined  to certain of our subsidiaries and or affiliates  including ecost 
in the event we need to advance further cash to ecost  we may be required to seek approval from our lenders to provide such funds 
we can provide no assurance that we will receive such approval from our lenders or any terms or conditions required by our lenders in order to obtain such approval

we receive municipal tax abatements in certain locations 
during we received notice from a municipality that we did not satisfy certain criteria necessary to maintain the abatements 
in december we received notice that the municipal authority planned to make an adjustment to our tax abatement 
we have disputed the adjustment as of december   but if the dispute is not resolved favorably  additional property taxes of approximately million could be assessed against us 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
inventory management we manage our inventories held for sale by maintaining sufficient quantities of product to achieve high order fill rates while at the same time maximizing inventory turnover rates 
inventory balances will fluctuate as we add new product lines 
to reduce the risk of loss due to supplier price reductions  our master distributor agreement  as well as certain vendor agreements in our ecost business  provide for price protection under which we receive credits if the supplier lowers prices on previously purchased inventory 

table of contents seasonality the seasonality of our service fee business is dependent upon the seasonality of our clients business and sales of their products 
accordingly  our management must rely upon the projections of our clients in assessing quarterly variability 
we believe that with our current client mix and their current business volumes  our run rate service fee business activity will be at its lowest in the quarter ended march we anticipate our supplies distributors product revenue will be highest during the quarter ended december our ecost business is moderately seasonal  reflecting the general pattern of peak sales for the retail industry during the holiday shopping season 
typically  a larger portion of our ecost revenues occur during the fourth fiscal quarter 
we believe our historical revenue pattern makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future revenues and results of operations 
we believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force to amend certain guidance in fasb accounting standards codification tm asc  revenue recognition   multiple element arrangements 
the amended guidance in asc modifies the separation criteria by eliminating the criterion that requires objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered item s  and eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation and instead requires that arrangement consideration be allocated  at the inception of the arrangement  to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the fasb also issued asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  to amend the scope of arrangements under asc  software   revenue recognition to exclude tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
the amended guidance in asc and asc is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early application and retrospective application permitted 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendments to asc and asc will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it would likely result in a material adverse impact to our business  operating results and financial condition 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
table of contents about matters that are uncertain 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above 
product revenue recognition sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
under these guidelines  we recognize a majority of our sales  including revenue from product sales and gross outbound shipping and handling charges  upon receipt of the product by the customer 
for all product sales shipped directly from suppliers to customers  we are the primary obligor in the transaction  and we take title to the products sold upon shipment  bear credit risk  and bear inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers  therefore  we recognize these revenues at gross sales amounts 
sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances  credit card fraud and chargebacks  all of which are estimated based upon historical information such as return and redemption rates  and fraud and chargeback experience 
management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates 
if actual sales returns  allowances  discounts and credit card fraud and chargebacks are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
cost of service fee revenue our service fee revenue primarily relates to our distribution services and order management customer care services 
distribution services relate primarily to inventory management  product receiving  warehousing and fulfillment ie  picking  packing and shipping 
order management customer care services relate primarily to taking customer orders for our clients products via various channels such as telephone call center  electronic or facsimile 
these services also entail addressing customer questions related to orders  as well as cross selling up selling activities 
our cost of service fee revenue represents the cost to provide the services described above  primarily compensation and related expenses and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing the services 
these include certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
certain of these costs are allocated from general and administrative expenses 
for these allocations  we estimate the amount of direct expenses based on a client specific number of transactions processed 
we believe our allocation methodology is reasonable  however a change in assumptions would result in a different gross profit in our statement of operations  yet no change to the resulting net income or loss 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our clients and customers operate 
inherently  these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our clients and customers ability to pay amounts due us to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the client or customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future 
with our master distributor and online discount retail businesses  we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables  which arise from inventory returns to vendors  vendor rebate and advertising programs  price protections and other promotions 
we determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors  including payment history 
amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non compliance with certain elements of vendor programs 
if our estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient  additional allowance maybe required 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts totaled million at both december  and we believe our allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our clients and customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 
inventory reserves inventories merchandise  held for resale  all of which are finished goods are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
supplies distributors and its subsidiaries assume responsibility for slow moving inventory under certain master distributor agreements  subject to certain termination rights  but have the right to return product rendered obsolete by engineering changes  as defined 
ecost assumes responsibility for slow moving inventory but has limited rights to return product based on specific inventory agreements 
we review inventories for impairment on a periodic basis  but at a minimum  annually 
recoverability of the inventory on hand is measured by comparisons of the carrying value to the fair value of the inventory 
this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
if write downs of inventories are necessary  the cost basis of that inventory is adjusted 
to determine these reserve amounts  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand and market conditions 
these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes 
at december  and  our allowance for slow moving inventory was million and million  respectively 
we believe our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions 
significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ  which could be material 
as we operate in multiple countries  we are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
intangible assets we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of intangible assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  we review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses in the period in which we determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this may require us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
during the 
table of contents fourth quarter of  we determined the carrying values of the intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of ecost were impaired  which resulted in a million write off of intangible assets in no intangible assets were determined to be impaired during goodwill the company acquired ecost in because of the strategic benefits expected to result from combining ecost s e commerce platform with pfsweb s advanced technology and operational infrastructure thereby providing the combined company with the enhanced ability to expand its market share in the fast growing web commerce market 
such benefits are the primary factors that contributed to a purchase price that resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
goodwill was derived by the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of ecost in  and is included in the ecost reportable segment 
goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes  is not being amortized but is subject to an impairment test each year  using a fair value based approach 
we review goodwill for impairment at least annually on december we record impairment losses in the period in which we determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
we estimate the fair value of the ecost reporting unit using a combination of valuation models  including the income approach method  the guideline company method  and stock price method 
these models require us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review  costs of capital and residual values 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined the carrying values of the goodwill resulting from our acquisition of ecost were impaired  which resulted in an million write off of goodwill in as of december   the estimated fair value of the ecost reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount by approximately
