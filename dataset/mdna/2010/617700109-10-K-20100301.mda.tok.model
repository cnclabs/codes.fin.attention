free cash flow is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec regulations 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure of performance required to be reported under gaap  nor should this data be considered an indicator of our overall financial performance or liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we frequently invoice or collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
these amounts are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets

all of these shares were sold by affiliates of softbank finance corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of softbank corp 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of these shares 
in addition  we granted the underwriters the right to purchase up to an additional  shares at the initial public offering price to cover over allotments 
in may  the underwriters exercised their over allotment option in full 
we received net proceeds of million based on our initial public offering price of per share  after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately million of offering expenses

understanding our company our mission is to create great products that help investors reach their financial goals 
we offer an extensive line of data  software  and research products for individual investors  financial advisors  and institutional clients 
we also offer asset management services for advisors  institutions  and retirement plan participants 
many of our products are sold through subscriptions or license agreements 
as a result  we typically generate recurring revenue 
morningstar has two operating segments investment information and investment management 
the investment information segment includes all of our data  software  and research products and services 
these products and services are typically sold through subscriptions or license agreements 
the investment management segment includes our asset management operations  which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset based fees 
we emphasize a decentralized approach to running our business to empower our managers and to create a culture of responsibility and accountability 
historically  we have focused primarily on organic growth by introducing new products and services and marketing our existing products 
however  we have made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions that support our five key growth strategies  which are enhance our position in key market segments by focusing on our three major internet based platforms  become a global leader in funds of funds investment management  continue building thought leadership in independent investment research  create a premier global investment database  and expand our international brand presence  products  and services 
graphic key business characteristics revenue we generate revenue by selling a variety of investment related products and services 
we sell many of our offerings  such as newsletters  principia software  and premium service on morningstar 
com  via subscriptions 
these subscriptions are mainly offered for a one year term  although we also offer terms ranging from one month to three years 
we also sell advertising on our websites throughout the world 
several of our other products are sold through license agreements  including morningstar advisor workstation  morningstar equity research  morningstar direct  retirement advice  and licensed data 
our license agreements typically range from one to three years 
for some of our other institutional services  mainly investment consulting  we generally base our fees on the scope of work and the level of service we provide and calculate them as a percentage of assets under advisement 
we also earn fees relating to morningstar managed portfolios and the managed retirement accounts offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson that we calculate as a percentage of assets under management 
overall  revenue tied to asset based fees accounted for about of our consolidated revenue in deferred revenue we frequently invoice our clients and collect cash in advance of providing services or fulfilling subscriptions for our customers 
as a result  we use some of this cash to fund our operations and invest in new product development 
the businesses we acquired over the past several years have similar business models  and as a result  we acquired their deferred revenue 
deferred revenue is the largest liability on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled million as of december  and million as of december  we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill the service obligations under our subscription  license  and service agreements 
significant operating leverage our business requires significant investments to create and maintain proprietary databases and content 
we strive to leverage these costs by selling a wide variety of products and services to multiple investor segments  through multiple media  and in many geographic markets 
in general  our businesses have high fixed costs  and we expect our revenue to increase or decrease more quickly than our expenses 
we believe that while the fixed costs of the investments in our business are relatively high  the variable cost of adding customers is considerably lower  particularly as a significant portion of our products and services focus on internet based platforms and assets under management 
at times  we will make investments in building our databases and content that will hurt our short term operating results 
during other periods  our profitability will improve because we re able to increase revenue without increasing our cost base at the same rate 
when revenue decreases  however  the significant operating leverage in our business may reduce our profitability 
operating expense we classify our operating expense into separate categories for cost of goods sold  development  sales and marketing  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization  as described below 
we include stock based compensation expense  as appropriate  in each of these categories 
cost of goods sold 
this category includes compensation expense for employees who produce the products and services we deliver to our customers 
for example  this category covers production teams and analysts who write investment research reports 
cost of goods sold also includes other expense such as postage  printing  and cd rom replication  as well as shareholder servicing fees for morningstar managed portfolios 
development 
this category includes compensation expense for programmers  designers  and other employees who develop new products and enhance existing products 
in some cases  we capitalize the compensation costs associated with certain development projects 
this reduces the expense that we would otherwise report in this category 
we amortize these capitalized costs over the estimated economic life of the software  which is generally three years  and include this expense in depreciation and amortization 
sales and marketing 
this category includes compensation expense for our sales teams  product managers  and other marketing professionals 
we also include the cost of advertising  direct mail campaigns  and other marketing programs to promote our products 
general and administrative 
this category consists mainly of compensation expense for each segment s management team  as well as human resources  finance  and support employees for each segment 
the category also includes compensation expense for senior management and other corporate costs  including corporate systems  finance and accounting  legal  and facilities expense 
depreciation and amortization 
our capital expenditures consist of computers  leasehold improvements  and capitalized product development costs related to certain software development projects 
we depreciate property and equipment primarily using the straight line method based on the useful life of the asset  which ranges from three to seven years 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the lease term or their useful lives  whichever is shorter 
we amortize capitalized product development costs over their estimated economic life  which is generally three years 
we also include amortization related to intangible assets  which is mainly driven by acquisitions  in this category 
we amortize intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic useful lives  which range from one to years 
international operations we have majority owned operations in countries outside of the united states and include these in our consolidated financial statements 
we account for our minority owned investments in japan  denmark  and sweden using the equity method 
how we evaluate our business when our analysts evaluate a stock  they focus on assessing the company s estimated intrinsic value the value of the company s future cash flows  discounted to their worth in today s dollars 
our approach to evaluating our own business works the same way 
our goal is to increase the intrinsic value of our business over time  which we believe is the best way to create value for our shareholders 
we do not make public financial forecasts for our business because we want to avoid creating any incentives for our management team to make speculative statements about our financial results that could influence the stock price  or to take actions that help us meet short term forecasts but may not be in the long term interest of building shareholder value 
we provide three specific measures that can help investors generate their own assessment of how our intrinsic value has changed over time revenue including organic revenue  operating income loss  and free cash flow  which we define as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
organic revenue is considered a non gaap financial measure under securities and exchange commission sec regulations 
we define organic revenue as consolidated revenue excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translations 
we present organic revenue because we believe it helps investors better compare our period to period results  and our management team uses this measure to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is also considered a non gaap financial measure 
we present this measure as supplemental information to help investors better understand trends in our business results over time 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is not equivalent to any measure of performance required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be considered an indicator of our overall financial performance or liquidity 
moreover  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
to evaluate how successful we ve been in maintaining existing business for products and services that have renewable revenue  we calculate a retention rate 
we use two different methods for calculating retention 
for subscription based products including our print newsletters  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and principia software  we track the number of subscriptions retained during the year 
for products sold through contracts and licenses  we use the contract value method  which is based on tracking the dollar value of renewals compared with the total dollar value of contracts up for renewal during the period 
we include changes in the contract value in the renewal amount  unless the change specifically results from adding a new product that we can identify 
we also include variable fee contracts in this calculation and use the previous quarter s actual revenue as the base rate for calculating the renewal percentage 
the retention rate excludes setup and customization fees  migrations to other morningstar products  and contract renewals that were pending as of january  the year in review industry overview we monitor developments in the economic and financial information industry on an ongoing basis 
we use these insights to help inform our company strategy  product development plans  and marketing initiatives 
following the severe market downturn in  the us market rebounded sharply by the end of despite continued negative performance in the first quarter of  the equity market gained for the year as measured by morningstar s us market index  a broad market index 
global markets also rallied  as did most fixed income investments 
total us mutual fund assets rose to trillion as of december   compared with trillion as of december   based on data from the investment company institute ici 
although aggregate cash flows to mutual funds were strong for the year  investors continued to show caution by heavily favoring fixed income funds rather than equity funds 
us stock funds had negative net cash flows for the year  although less so than in global mutual fund assets showed a similar trend  with total assets rising after s decline  but asset flows weighted toward fixed income portfolios 
the downturn in also led to contraction in the number of funds 
the number of mutual funds in the united states fell to about  in excluding multiple share classes from  in  based on data from the ici 
global mutual funds also contracted  with the number of funds totaling  as of september   compared with more than  as of september   based on ici data 
despite strong market performance in  we estimate that hedge funds included in morningstar s database had about billion in net outflows through december   compared with about billion for the same period in however  many hedge fund categories had positive inflows later in the year 
exchange traded funds continued to increase in popularity relative to traditional mutual funds 
the us etf industry closed out with billion in assets under management based on morningstar s data  up from billion at the end of based on data from nielsen net ratings  aggregate page views and the number of unique users for financial and investment sites in both declined by about to compared with  while the amount of time spent per visit was down more 
we attribute these trends to the unusual level of market volatility in  which increased investor interest in financial and investment sites in the year ago period 
although unique users and page views for morningstar 
com also declined during  the site continued to perform well based on metrics such as pages viewed per visit and time spent per visit 
economic uncertainty continued to weigh on the global advertising market 
magna  a division of interpublic group  estimates that industry wide revenue for online advertising was down about in although online advertising has held up better than other areas as advertisers have continued to shift spending from traditional media to the internet  we believe that spending in the financial services area remains under pressure 
following s downturn in advertising sales  several surveys conducted by the american marketing association and other organizations have projected moderate increases in overall ad spending for asset managers and other financial services firms continued to consolidate in the wake of the global financial crisis 
if one of our clients is acquired  we may lose business if we re not able to continue providing services or expand our business with the combined organization 
the financial crisis of and caused sharp cutbacks in investment research spending by institutional clients and financial advisors  many of whom had staff layoffs or other reductions in spending 
we believe individual investors also reduced discretionary spending because of the weak economic environment in despite spending pressures  we believe our clients continue to find value in our services 
some of our products allow clients to streamline the number of third party applications they use and save money 
we ve also created a new enterprise data management business that offers back office service bureau and performance reporting operations to financial advisors 
by outsourcing these services  clients can leverage our infrastructure and capabilities to offload non core tasks and save money 
the global financial crisis has led to increased regulatory scrutiny of financial services around the world 
in germany and france  for example  independent financial advisors have been under pressure to provide more written evidence for their advice to clients 
hong kong regulators recently implemented increased regulatory requirements for risk disclosure to retail clients 
the united kingdom s retail distribution review rdr  which emphasizes increased regulation of advisory fees  higher professional standards for financial advisors  and an emphasis on whole of market investment solutions  is scheduled to come into effect at the end of because advisors will be obligated to give clients a choice of all investment vehicles including funds  etfs  and structured products and demonstrate that they consider different investment options without bias  we believe it may increase the business need for investment information on multiple investment types  which we offer through products such as morningstar direct and morningstar advisor workstation 
the obama administration has proposed numerous financial regulatory reforms 
we don t believe the majority of these reforms would have a direct impact on our business  although they will likely impact many of our clients 
several proposed regulations may also impact investment advice and retirement plans  including additional regulations on asset custody  privacy  and other investor protection issues 
we continue to monitor the potential impact of these proposed regulations on our business 
overall  we remain cautious because of the difficult market environment  which persisted in the wake of the financial crisis that began in despite the recent upturn in the us equity market  we believe asset management firms and other financial services companies continue to carefully scrutinize their spending levels  creating additional pricing pressure and increasing the time required to close new business and renewals 
on the positive side  however  we believe some of the uncertainty in the financial services sector began easing during  with business trends improving toward the end of the year 
as discussed in more detail in the consolidated operating income section below  in early we began phasing in some of the benefits and other compensation related expenses we previously reduced 
performance summary the list below summarizes the key accomplishments and challenges that our management team has highlighted related to our performance accomplishments we completed six acquisitions  four of which were outside the united states 
these acquisitions represent approximately million in annual revenue 
we increased our ownership interest in morningstar korea  making it one of our majority owned operations 
we also integrated many capabilities from previous acquisitions 
we continued investing in our three key web based platforms  morningstar 
com  morningstar advisor workstation  and morningstar direct 
licensed data had strong renewal rates and ranks as our largest product by revenue 
morningstar direct continued its strong growth and now ranks as our fifth largest product by revenue 
we expanded our research offerings  including the launch of corporate credit ratings on public companies  basic profile reports for nasdaq listed companies  target date fund series ratings and research reports for of the largest fund series  qualitative research and ratings for more than european and asian funds  and a global fund investor experience study across countries 
in our investment management segment  we continued our work in custom target date funds and lifetime financial advice and expanded our consulting services internationally 
we added database coverage of more than  securities and expanded our fundamental data on global stocks and exchange traded funds 
we created a new enterprise data management business that offers back office service bureau and performance reporting operations to financial advisors 
challenges despite an upturn in the market  revenue declined for the second time in our history  and operating income fell 
many of our clients were cutting budgets  reducing staff  and experiencing the effects of industry consolidation  all of which had a direct impact on our business 
we had lower revenue for investment consulting because one client did not renew its contract in the fourth quarter of and another client did not renew its contract in may the independent equity research we provided to six banks under the terms of the global analyst research settlement ended in july as a result  equity research revenue was million lower in versus internet advertising sales were down sharply  premium membership subscriptions for morningstar 
com fell  and revenue for morningstar principia was down for the year 
our results include a total of million in operating expense related to two unanticipated matters 
we recorded a million operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of some stock options that were originally considered incentive stock options  and we incurred million in operating expense for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises from through consolidated results change change revenue operating income operating margin pp pp cash used for investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow pp percentage point s as noted in how we evaluate our business  we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
please refer to the discussion on page for more detail 
because we ve made several acquisitions in recent years  comparing our financial results from year to year is complex 
to make it easier for investors to compare our results in different periods  we provide information on both revenue from acquisitions and organic revenue  which reflects our underlying business excluding revenue from acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations 
we include an acquired operation as part of our revenue from acquisitions for months after we complete the acquisition 
after that  we include it as part of our organic revenue 
consolidated organic revenue revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations is considered a non gaap financial measure 
the definition of organic revenue we use may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
organic revenue should not be considered an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated under gaap 
the table below shows the periods in which we included each acquired operation in revenue from acquisitions graphic consolidated revenue in  our consolidated revenue decreased to million 
we had about million in incremental revenue from acquisitions during the year  mainly reflecting additional revenue from tenfore systems limited tenfore  as well as k wizard technology  llc k wizard  the equity research and data business from cpms cpms  intech pty limited intech  fundamental data limited fundamental data  and others 
however  this was more than offset by lower organic revenue  largely reflecting a drop in revenue from investment consulting as well as lower equity research revenue related to the global analyst research settlement 
investment consulting revenue declined because two clients did not renew their contracts  one in october and the other in may the global analyst research settlement period expired in july our results also suffered because of the continuing effects of the severe market downturn in  which put pressure on client budgets and led to consolidation among some of our clients 
our organic growth rate decelerated during because of these adverse market conditions and continued deteriorating during the first half of while our organic revenue was down for the year  we believe the trend in the second half is encouraging 
our organic revenue fell in the third quarter of  but only in the fourth quarter 
graphic our consolidated revenue increased to million in  reflecting positive organic growth for the year as well as new revenue from acquisitions  with the majority driven by the hemscott businesses we acquired in january acquired operations contributed million of revenue and represented percentage points of our consolidated revenue growth in the tables below reconcile consolidated revenue with organic revenue revenue excluding acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translations vs

licensed data was another significant contributor to revenue growth  and investment research revenue also rose for the year 
investment management segment revenue rose in total assets under advisement for investment consulting declined approximately  partly driven by the market downturn as well as the impact of one client not renewing its contract

com  and morningstar direct made up about of consolidated revenue in while the percentage of revenue made up by our top five products has remained relatively consistent over the past three years  the relative size of products within the top five has changed each year 
licensed data became our largest product in and continued increasing as a percentage of revenue in  partly because of incremental revenue from tenfore  k wizard  and fundamental data 
investment consulting moved down to become the third largest product in  while morningstar direct moved up to become the fifth largest product because of continued license growth 
in  as a part of the changes to our organizational structure with a focus on our global product lines  we no longer include morningstar site builder as part of morningstar advisor workstation 
site builder consists of a set of integrated tools  content  and reports that investment firms can seamlessly add to their existing advisor websites 
in addition  we re continuing to globalize the premium subscriptions and advertising revenue generated by morningstar 
com websites  which operate in a variety of markets 
as a result  we now include advertising revenue for all non us sites as part of morningstar 
com and have reclassified prior year product revenue for consistency with current year presentation

the following graph illustrates these two metrics over the past five years graphic in  we estimate that our retention rate for subscription based products  such as principia  morningstar 
com premium membership service  and print and online newsletters  was on the higher end of the range between and  down from to in for contract based products and services  we estimate that our weighted average renewal rate was on the low end of the range between and and was down about percentage points from our renewal rate in the decline in renewal rates in was largely driven by the end of the global analyst research settlement period 
excluding this factor  the renewal rate declined about percentage points from this decline reflects lower renewal rates for several product lines  including investment consulting  institutional software  and advisor software 
many of our clients were cutting budgets  reducing staff  and experiencing the effects of industry consolidation during the figure for contract based products includes the impact of price changes and changes to the contract value upon renewal  as well as changes in the value of variable fee contracts 
consolidated operating expense operating expense change of revenue change pp pp pp our consolidated operating expense decreased million  or  in to better align operating expense with revenue in a challenging business environment  we took a number of steps to reduce costs beginning in  with the largest cutbacks effective january  we changed our bonus plan in to reduce bonus expense  our single largest discretionary cost 
as a result  bonus expense was down about million in the significant reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in compared with we also suspended matching contributions to our k program in the united states  which reduced operating expense by about million 
in addition  we reduced discretionary spending in travel  advertising  and marketing 
travel costs were about million lower in advertising and marketing costs declined by million in we ve been carefully evaluating spending in this area and cutting back on programs with lower returns 
in addition  we discontinued three publications previously published  which contributed to lower marketing expense in the positive impact of these cost reductions was partially offset by incremental costs from acquisitions 
we completed six acquisitions in and six in because of the timing of these acquisitions  our results include operating expense that did not exist in headcount and salary expense increased year over year  partly because of incremental employees added through acquisitions 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   a increase  from  employees as of december  we added approximately employees through acquisitions over the months ending december  the remainder of the increase in headcount reflects continued hiring for our development center in china 
the cost reductions were further offset by a total of million of operating expense for two separate matters 
first  we recorded a million operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options that were originally considered incentive stock options isos 
in   and  we granted isos to many employees 
upon exercise  isos typically have a favorable tax treatment for the employee relative to the tax treatment for non qualified stock options nqsos 
in  we determined that certain isos granted to one former and two current executives should have been treated as nqsos for the executives and our income tax purposes 
as a result  morningstar will pay these individuals a total of million to compensate for the difference in tax treatment 
we also recorded million  primarily for potential penalties related to this matter 
this million expense is included in our operating expenses as a general and administrative expense 
second  we recorded an operating expense of million for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises 
the expense impacted each of our operating expense categories  with approximately half recorded as general and administrative expense 
for some companies  including morningstar  it is common practice for taxes withheld on stock based compensation to be paid with the company s regularly scheduled payroll deposit 
this approach  however  does not technically comply with internal revenue service irs guidelines concerning deposits of taxes withheld in connection with stock based compensation  which generally require that if a company s cumulative deposit liability for all compensation exceeds  the tax withholding must be deposited by the following business day 
transactions related to stock based compensation frequently cause companies to exceed this threshold outside of their regularly scheduled payroll cycles  thus triggering the accelerated deposit rules 
the subject of tax deposit penalties was part of an irs audit that began in and concluded in early we have concluded the matter with the irs and have increased the frequency of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises 
our operating expense in also includes additional rent expense of million to increase a liability related to vacant office space  primarily for the former ibbotson headquarters 
we increased the liability because we anticipate receiving lower sublease income and expect it will take more time than previously estimated to identify a tenant 
despite significant reductions to bonus expense  operating expense as a percentage of revenue increased percentage points in  mainly driven by the million of incremental operating expenses described above and other expense increases 
in  our consolidated operating expense increased million  or 
compensation related expense  excluding bonuses  accounted for two thirds of the increase in  mainly because of a increase in worldwide headcount and higher sales commission expense 
lower bonus expense partially offset these increases 
we had approximately  employees worldwide as of december   compared with  as of december  approximately half of the growth in headcount was from acquisitions 
in addition  in we hired employees for the morningstar development program  a two year rotational training program for entry level college graduates 
bonus expense declined million because of lower growth in our financial performance compared with the previous year 
excluding compensation related expense and bonus expense  operating expense increased million in about one third of this operating expense increase was from higher lease expense for our new headquarters and other global offices 
during  we recorded lease expense for our new headquarters as well as for our former headquarters  which was occupied until december depreciation and amortization rose million in  and we incurred additional costs across all operating expense categories from acquisitions 
higher costs in these areas were partially offset by lower legal and professional fees  which declined million 
in  we recorded million in expense related to the settlement of litigation in australia 
in addition  we had about million in product implementation costs for advice by ibbotson in that did not recur in as a percentage of revenue  operating expense in declined percentage points 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold change of revenue change pp pp pp gross profit change gross margin change pp pp pp cost of goods sold is our largest category of operating expense  accounting for more than one third of our total operating expense over the past three years 
our business relies heavily on human capital  and cost of goods sold includes the compensation expense for employees who produce our products and services 
cost of goods sold decreased million in  with the majority of the decline driven by lower bonus expense and lower fulfillment expense  partially offset by incremental costs from acquisitions 
cost of goods sold increased million in three quarters of the increase was driven by higher compensation expense  excluding incentive compensation  which was partly offset by a reduction in product implementation expense 
in  we recorded million for outsourced product implementation expense associated with the advice by ibbotson service 
these costs did not recur in incremental costs from acquisitions contributed to the higher compensation expense  and were the largest contributor to the remainder of the cost increases 
incentive compensation in was about the same as in gross margin declined by about one percentage point in  reversing the trend in the two previous years 
development expense development expense change of revenue change pp pp development expense decreased million in  mainly because of lower bonus expense  which was partially offset by incremental compensation costs from acquisitions 
development expense as a percentage of revenue in was consistent with and sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense change of revenue change pp pp pp sales and marketing expense decreased million in lower bonus expense and advertising and marketing were the two largest factors driving this change  with each contributing about of the decline 
we reduced advertising and marketing from higher levels in because of the challenging business environment 
in  we also discontinued three of the publications we previously published in the first quarter of each year morningstar funds  morningstar stocks  and morningstar etfs and therefore didn t incur costs to promote these publications 
reduced spending on travel  training  and conferences also contributed to the decrease  but to a lesser extent 
sales and marketing expense increased million in higher compensation expense  including sales commissions  was the main contributor to the change 
in addition  we had incremental costs from acquisitions because of growth in headcount and the number of products and services sold 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expense decreased about percentage point in  following a slight increase in general and administrative expense general and administrative expense change of revenue change pp pp pp general and administrative g a expense decreased million in most of the decline reflects lower bonus expense included in this category 
decreases in travel  training  and conferences also contributed to lower expense in this area  but to a lesser extent 
these cost reductions were partially offset by the million operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options as well as an operating expense for the deposit penalty  which contributed million to general and administrative expense in we discuss both of these matters in more detail in the consolidated operating expense section  on page g a expense increased million in as lease costs grew 
in  lease costs rose because we recorded lease expense for our new chicago headquarters as well as for the office space we occupied until december compensation expense also increased  but was offset by the favorable impact of lower bonus expense 
increases in this cost category were also offset by a million reduction in legal and professional fees 
as a percentage of revenue  g a expense increased percentage points in depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense amortization expense total depreciation and amortization expense change of revenue change pp pp pp deprecation expense rose million in  primarily from higher depreciation expense associated with our new corporate headquarters 
amortization expense increased million in and million in  reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization increased percentage points in we expect that amortization of intangible assets will be an ongoing cost for the remaining life of the assets 
based on acquisitions completed through december   we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be million in our estimates of future amortization expense for intangible assets may be affected by changes to the preliminary purchase price allocations associated with our acquisitions 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense is included in each of our operating expense categories  as shown below cost of goods sold development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation expense change of revenue change pp pp pp our stock based compensation expense mainly relates to grants of restricted stock units  and to a lesser extent  to stock options granted in previous years restricted stock units stock options stock based compensation expense we began granting restricted stock units rsus in may and made additional grants in   and  typically in the second quarter of each year 
we recognize the expense related to rsus over the vesting period  which is generally four years 
we estimate forfeitures of all stock based awards and typically adjust the estimated forfeitures to actual forfeiture experience in the second quarter  which is when most of our larger equity grants typically vest 
in the second quarters of   and  we recorded approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of additional stock based compensation expense as a result of these adjustments 
our stock based compensation expense related to rsus has increased over the past three years  reflecting the additional rsu grants 
in contrast  the stock based compensation expense related to stock options has declined over the past three years reflecting no stock option grants in and  a small grant in  and that stock options granted prior to were fully expensed by as discussed above  in we adjusted the tax treatment of certain stock options that were originally considered incentive stock options 
this change did not impact the amount of stock based compensation expense we recorded related to these stock options 
based on grants made through december   we anticipate that stock based compensation expense will be million in this amount is subject to change based on additional equity grants or changes in our estimated forfeiture rate related to these grants 
bonus expense bonus expense change of revenue change pp pp pp bonus expense  which we include in each of our operating expense categories  declined million in this reduction reflects changes we made to our bonus program for as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue in the challenging business environment 
the significant reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in compared with overall  bonus expense as a percentage of revenue declined about percentage points in in  bonus expense declined about million  or 
bonus expense declined to of revenue in  compared with in  reflecting the lower operating income growth in compared with the amount of bonus expense is not a fixed cost 
instead  the size of the bonus pool varies each year based on a number of items  including changes in full year operating income relative to the previous year and other factors 
we review and update our estimates and the bonus pool size quarterly 
we record bonus expense throughout the year and pay out annual bonuses to employees in the first quarter of the following year 
consolidated operating income operating income change operating margin change pp pp pp consolidated operating income decreased million in  as the million decline in revenue was partially offset by a million reduction in operating expense 
we took a number of steps to reduce our cost structure in mainly by reducing employee benefit costs and bonus expense 
while cost reductions began in  the largest reductions were effective january  we reduced our single largest discretionary cost  bonus expense  by million  with changes to the bonus plan in we also suspended matching contributions to our k program in the united states  which accounted for about million of expense in in addition  lease related costs incurred in the fourth quarter of did not recur in because we no longer incur lease costs for both our new and former corporate headquarters in chicago 
although we reduced operating expense in several areas with the cost savings initiatives implemented at the beginning of  we recorded a total of million of unanticipated expense for two separate matters  including million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of incentive stock options granted in previous years and million of operating expense for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises 
because operating expense declined at a slower pace than revenue  the operating margin was down about percentage points from s operating margin 
the million of operating expense described above represented about percentage points of the margin decline 
in  we began phasing in some of the benefits we temporarily suspended in we re now matching of employee contributions up to of salary to our k plan in the united states  compared with a full match up to of salary before we kept salary levels flat for nearly all of our employees in  but expect to make some moderate compensation increases later in we ve also been hiring for some previously unfilled positions 
consolidated operating income increased million in in  the operating margin increased by percentage points partly because of lower bonus expense and legal expense as a percentage of revenue  as well as the million decline in product implementation expense associated with the advice by ibbotson service 
higher lease expense as a percentage of revenue offset these positive factors and contributed to the lower operating margin growth compared with the two previous years 
incremental costs added by acquisitions  such as amortization of intangible assets and higher compensation costs  also contributed to slower growth in the operating margin 
importantly  the annual operating margin reflects a mix of higher operating margins early in the year and lower margins in the latter part of the year  which worsened as the business environment became more challenging 
our operating margin was in the fourth quarter of  compared with in fourth quarter of graphic consolidated free cash flow we define free cash flow as cash provided by or used for operating activities less capital expenditures 
we present free cash flow solely as supplemental disclosure to help investors better understand how much cash is available after we spend money to operate our business 
our management team uses free cash flow to evaluate the performance of our business 
free cash flow is not a measure of performance set forth under gaap 
also  the free cash flow definition we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
we generated positive free cash flow in   and as our cash provided by operating activities has consistently exceeded our level of capital expenditures  as shown below change change cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow free cash flow fell million in  reflecting a million decrease in cash provided by operating activities  which was partially offset by a million decrease in capital expenditures 
free cash flow increased million in  reflecting a million increase in cash flow provided by operating activities  which was offset by a million increase in capital expenditures 
cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities decreased million in the decline in cash provided by operating activities reflects a lower cash benefit from accrued compensation as well as an increase of million for bonus payments 
we made bonus payments of million in the first quarter of  compared with million in the first quarter of bonuses paid in the first quarter of included million in payments deferred from we revised our bonus program in january and no longer defer payment of a portion of bonuses recorded in the prior year 
in addition  cash provided by operating activities in included a million benefit from deferred rent  primarily for tenant improvement allowances related to the construction of our new corporate headquarters 
this benefit did not recur in excess tax benefits declined million in because of a reduction in the number of options exercised and lower average stock prices on the exercise dates 
cash provided by operating activities increased million in compared with the increase resulted from the positive impact of higher net income adjusted for non cash items of million and an increase in deferred rent of million 
these increases were offset by the impact of higher cash paid for bonuses of million and a decrease in the impact of accrued income taxes and accrued compensation 
deferred rent includes the tenant improvement allowance received in connection with the build out of our new headquarters 
the tenant improvement allowance will be amortized over the lease term as a reduction in office lease expense 
to provide investors with additional insight into our financial results  we provide a comparison between the change in consolidated net income and the change in cash provided by operating activities change change consolidated net income adjustments to reconcile consolidated net income to net cash flows from operating activities excess tax benefits from stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units depreciation and amortization expense stock based compensation expense all other non cash items included in net income changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions cash paid for bonuses cash paid for income taxes accounts receivable deferred revenue income taxes current accrued compensation deferred rent other assets reduction of australian litigation reserve accounts payable and accrued liabilities all other cash provided by operating activities in  the decline in cash provided by operating activities was greater than the decline in consolidated net income  reflecting the difference in timing between cash receipts or disbursements and when these items are recognized in revenue or expense 
deferred rent of million  primarily for tenant improvement allowances received in connection with the build out of our new headquarters benefited cash flow in  but did not recur in the tenant improvement allowance received in is being amortized as a reduction in office lease expense over the lease term and will be deducted from net income to arrive at cash provided by operating activities 
the million increase in tax payments as well as the million increase in bonuses paid in compared with also contributed to the difference between net income and cash provided by operations 
a lower cash flow benefit from accrued compensation  primarily reflecting the reduction in the bonus expense  also contributed to the difference between net income and cash from operations 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in outpaced the million increase in consolidated net income 
the tenant improvement allowance of million received in connection with the build out of our new headquarters represented a significant benefit to cash flow in non cash items included in net income were a primary driver of the difference between net income and cash provided by operations in fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  requires that we classify excess tax benefits as a financing activity  which contributes to the difference between net income and cash from operations 
in   and we classified million  million  and million of excess tax benefits  respectively  as financing activities 
we describe these excess tax benefits in the liquidity and capital resources section 
capital expenditures capital expenditures decreased million in mainly because of the timing of payments related to our new corporate headquarters in chicago 
in  capital expenditures were million  an increase of million from the increase was almost entirely driven by capital expenditures for our new headquarters

morningstar direct is a web based institutional research platform 
principia is our cd rom based investment research and planning software for advisors 
the investment information segment also includes morningstar equity research  which we distribute through several channels 
from june through july  our equity research was distributed through six major investment banks to meet the requirements for independent research under the global analyst research settlement gars 
the period covered by gars expired at the end of july the investment banks covered by it are no longer required to provide independent investment research to their clients 
for further discussion about this issue  see item a risk factors 
we also sell equity research to several other companies that purchase our research for their own use or provide our research to their affiliated financial advisors or to individual investors 
we also offer a variety of financial communications and newsletters  other investment software  and investment indexes 
this segment represented   and of our consolidated revenue in   and  respectively 
graphic revenue revenue for our investment information segment declined million in acquisitions contributed million to segment revenue in  partially offsetting the decline across a number of our product lines 
revenue from our investment research products was down  mainly reflecting the end of gars and  to a lesser extent  lower revenue from investment newsletters 
organic revenue for software product lines was down about  driven by declines in the us version of morningstar 
com and  to a much lesser extent  advisor software 
these declines were partly offset by higher revenue for institutional software and data related products and services 
as mentioned above  the period covered by gars expired at the end of july  and as previously disclosed  our post settlement equity research revenue was significantly lower in gars revenue was million in  compared with million in we entered into new equity research contracts with two of the banks that were clients under gars  however  these contracts only represent about of the previous annual gars revenue 
in addition  we re continuing to provide broad equity coverage to individual investors  financial advisors  and institutions through a variety of other channels 
for further discussion about this issue  see item a risk factors 
revenue from our other investment research products declined in primarily because of lower revenue from newsletters and books 
in the first quarter of  we discontinued three of the print publications we previously published in the first quarter of each year morningstar funds  morningstar stocks  and morningstar etfs lower advertising revenue from publications sold in australia and lower revenue from the annual morningstar investment conference held in the second quarter also contributed to the decline 
the us version of morningstar 
com  which includes internet advertising sales and premium membership subscriptions  was the second largest driver behind the revenue decline in the segment 
negative trends in internet advertising drove most of the decrease 
in addition  subscriptions for the morningstar 
com premium service fell by to  as of december   compared with  as of december  because of negative trends in subscriber growth and new trials 
however  we moderately increased subscription prices for premium membership in both january and  which partially offset lower revenue from the subscription decline 
advisor software revenue was down in  reflecting lower principia revenue partially offset by higher revenue for advisor workstation and other products 
principia subscriptions totaled  as of december   a decrease from  as of december  the decline partly reflects clients migrating from principia to advisor workstation  but also reflects a lower retention rate as the economic environment weakened 
advisor workstation revenue increased in because of higher revenue in the first half of the year 
the number of us licenses for morningstar advisor workstation decreased to  as of december  compared with  as of december  the decrease reflects clients migrating to site builder and a change in the scope of some licenses  partially offset by new contracts in in  as a part of the changes to our organizational structure with a focus on our global product lines  we no longer include morningstar site builder as part of morningstar advisor workstation 
site builder consists of a set of integrated tools  content  and reports that investment firms can seamlessly add to their existing advisor websites 
the number of advisor workstation licenses reported in has been adjusted to reflect this change 
higher revenue from our institutional software and data product lines partially offset the declines in individual and advisor software 
institutional software revenue increased mainly because of morningstar direct 
the number of licenses for morningstar direct grew to  worldwide as of december   compared with  as of december  revenue from licensed data also increased in in  revenue from the investment information segment increased million 
acquisitions contributed approximately million of revenue 
excluding acquisitions  the revenue expansion was driven by morningstar advisor workstation  licensed data  morningstar direct  and morningstar 
com 
the number of us licenses for morningstar advisor workstation increased to  as of december  compared with  as of december  the revenue growth reflects new client contracts as well as additional users and functionality for existing clients 
part of this growth reflects expansions in the scope of some contracts to full site licenses where we include all eligible advisors in our total license count  from tools only licenses where we include a smaller number of advisors based on actual usage 
licensed data was also a major contributor to organic revenue growth in this segment in  as demand for data feeds and other services remained strong for most of the year 
morningstar direct also had a positive impact  as the number of licenses for morningstar direct totaled  worldwide as of december   up compared with  as of december  morningstar 
com premium membership and internet advertising sales contributed to organic revenue growth in  but slowed throughout the year 
subscriptions for morningstar 
com premium service fell slightly to  as of december  compared with  as of december  as general market weakness affected subscriber growth and new trials 
in addition  we moderately increased subscription prices for premium membership in january as a result  revenue grew despite the decline in the number of subscriptions 
operating income in  operating income for the investment information segment was million  a slight decrease compared with  as the million decline in revenue was partially offset by lower operating expense 
operating expense decreased million in as cost reductions for discretionary expense such as bonuses  other compensation expense  and advertising and marketing were partially offset by additional operating expense from acquisitions 
bonus expense declined million in most of this reduction reflects the changes we made to our bonus program for as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue 
the reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in compared with other compensation related expense was down  primarily because we suspended matching contributions to our k plan in the united states  reducing operating expense by million in sales and marketing costs decreased million in most of the decline reflects lower spending on advertising and marketing primarily direct mail expense and lower travel costs  which we pared back because of the challenging business environment 
as mentioned above  we discontinued three of the publications we previously published in the first quarter of each year  and therefore didn t incur costs to promote these publications in our investment information segment operating margin improved slightly in because of operating expense reductions partially offset by the impact of acquisitions in operating income for the segment increased million in operating expense increased million  with compensation related expense generating most of the increase 
incremental costs added from acquired businesses also accounted for a portion of the increase across all cost categories 
the operating margin in grew modestly  up percentage points  because operating expense grew at a slower rate than revenue 
investment management segment the investment management segment includes all of our asset management operations  which operate as registered investment advisors and earn more than half of their revenue from asset based fees 
the key products and services in this segment based on revenue are investment consulting  which focuses on investment monitoring and asset allocation for funds of funds  including mutual funds and variable annuities  retirement advice  including the morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson platforms  and morningstar managed portfolios  a fee based discretionary asset management service that includes a series of mutual fund and exchange traded fund portfolios tailored to meet a range of investment time horizons and risk levels that financial advisors can use for their clients taxable and tax deferred accounts 
acquisitions  primarily the intech acquisition in australia  contributed revenue of million to this segment in this segment represented  and of our consolidated revenue in   and  respectively 
graphic revenue although revenue declined across all products in the investment management segment  investment consulting  which has been a leading contributor to revenue growth in previous years  accounted for about three fourths of the segment s revenue decline in and was relatively flat year over year in our investment consulting business suffered in because one client did not renew its contract when it expired in the fourth quarter of and another client did not renew its contract in may combined  these contracts represented about million of revenue in we provided advisory services on approximately billion in assets as of december   compared with approximately billion as of december  and approximately billion as of december  these asset totals include relationships for which we receive basis point fees  including consulting and agreements where we act as a portfolio construction manager for a mutual fund or variable annuity 
we also provide investment consulting services for some assets under management for which we receive a flat fee  these assets are not included in the total assets reported above 
excluding changes related to contract wins or cancellations  changes in the value of assets under advisement can come from two primary sources gains or losses related to overall trends in market performance  and net inflows or outflows caused when investors add to or redeem shares from these portfolios 
total assets under advisement for investment consulting as of december  declined approximately compared with december   as assets under advisement from morningstar associates declined  which was partially offset by assets under advisement from ibbotson associates  which increased about 
the majority of the asset decline in reflects the loss of one of the contracts discussed above  partially offset by positive market performance  and  to a lesser extent  from net inflows and new client wins in assets under advisement 
total assets under advisement for investment consulting declined approximately as of december  compared with december  in  the us stock market fell about and was the main factor behind the decline in assets for most portfolios 
the reduction in assets under advisement compared with also reflects the client non renewal in the fourth quarter of as a result  assets under advisement for morningstar associates declined more than the market for the year 
as of december assets under advisement for investment consulting billions ibbotson associates morningstar associates total in addition  total assets under management for intech now doing business as ibbotson associates were million as of december  retirement advice revenue was also down in  although less than investment consulting 
we primarily earn license based fees for the advice and guidance services we provide through our retirement advice platform  and revenue for these services declined because of several smaller client nonrenewals in assets under management for retirement advice increased to billion as of december   compared with billion as of december  and billion as of december  in  retirement advice revenue was up slightly compared with as of december assets under management for managed retirement accounts billions advice by ibbotson morningstar retirement manager total the tables below show the breakdown of retirement plan participants who had access to the services offered through morningstar retirement manager and advice by ibbotson  as well as the number of plan sponsors and plan providers that provide this access 
as of december plan participants millions advice by ibbotson morningstar retirement manager total plan sponsors approximate advice by ibbotson morningstar retirement manager total plan providers advice by ibbotson morningstar retirement manager total morningstar managed portfolios also contributed to the segment s revenue decline in  although to a much lesser extent than investment consulting 
the lower revenue mainly reflects lower average asset levels during compared with the same period in assets under management for morningstar managed portfolios regained asset levels observed in previous years  ending at billion as of december  compared with billion as of december  and billion as of december  revenue for morningstar managed portfolios was flat in compared with operating income operating expense in the segment decreased million  or  in the decrease was primarily because of lower bonus and other compensation related expense  partially offset by the additional operating expense related to the intech acquisition 
bonus expense declined million in most of this reduction reflects the changes we made to our bonus program for as part of our efforts to better align our cost structure with revenue 
the reduction in bonus expense also reflects a slowdown in our financial performance in compared with other compensation related expense was down  primarily because we suspended matching contributions to our k plan in the united states  reducing operating expense by million in a slight reduction in product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service also contributed to the decrease 
operating margin was in  an increase of percentage points over lower bonus expense as a percentage of revenue was the main driver of the margin improvement 
the decrease in other compensation related expense also contributed to the margin improvement  although to a much lesser extent 
these factors were offset by incremental costs from the intech acquisition and higher compensation expense as a percentage of revenue 
operating expense decreased million in  driven by lower bonus expense and a reduction in product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service 
the expense decrease was partially offset by an increase in compensation expense  excluding bonus 
operating margin was in compared with in product implementation fees related to our advice by ibbotson service represented of revenue in  but were significantly lower in lower bonus expense as a percentage of revenue also had a favorable impact on the margin 
corporate items this category includes corporate costs  which we do not allocate to our business segments 
the corporate items category also includes amortization expense related to intangible assets recorded for acquisitions 
the table below shows the components of corporate items that impacted our consolidated operating income amortization expense depreciation expense corporate unallocated corporate items change amortization of intangible assets increased million in and million in we paid million for acquisitions during the past three years 
as of december  and december   respectively  we had million and million recorded for net intangible assets 
we amortize these intangible assets over their estimated lives  ranging from one to years 
based on acquisitions completed through december   we estimate that aggregate amortization expense for intangible assets will be million in some of the purchase price allocations are preliminary  and the values assigned to intangible assets and the associated amortization expense may change in future periods 
depreciation expense for corporate departments increased million in we relocated to our new corporate headquarters in the fourth quarter of  resulting in higher depreciation expense 
depreciation expense included in this category declined in because computer equipment and internal product development costs capitalized in previous years were fully depreciated 
corporate unallocated increased million in in  this category includes million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options  as well as an operating expense for the deposit penalty of million 
this category also includes a million expense to increase lease vacancy reserves  primarily for the former ibbotson headquarters 
these additional costs were almost entirely offset by lower bonus expense and other compensation related expense  as well as lower travel expense 
corporate unallocated increased million in  primarily because of higher lease expense 
lease costs rose because we recorded lease expense for our new headquarters as well as for the former headquarters space we occupied until december the higher lease expense was partially offset by a decrease in professional fees 
we recorded an expense of million related to settling our australian litigation in  but this expense did not recur in or equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  non operating income  and income tax expense equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities includes our portion of the net income loss of morningstar japan kk mjkk  morningstar danmark a s  morningstar sweden ab  and morningstar korea co  ltd 
in   and  equity in net income of unconsolidated entities was primarily from our position in mjkk 
in  we acquired an additional ownership interest in morningstar korea  increasing our ownership percentage to 
as a result of the majority ownership  we no longer account for our investment in morningstar korea using the equity method 
beginning in september  we consolidate the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of this operation in our consolidated financial statements 
we describe our investments in unconsolidated entities in more detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
non operating income the following table presents the components of net non operating income interest income  net other expense  net non operating income  net net interest income mainly reflects interest from our investment portfolio 
net interest income decreased million in and million during the decrease in both years reflects lower returns on our invested balances during the year 
other expense  net  mainly reflects foreign currency exchange gains and losses arising from the ordinary course of business related to our us and non us operations 
it also includes royalty income from mjkk and realized gains and losses from our investment portfolio 
in  this category includes a holding gain of approximately million resulting from the difference between the fair value and the book value of our investment in morningstar korea 
the larger expense in was influenced primarily by foreign currency exchange losses in the fourth quarter driven by a significantly stronger us dollar 
income tax expense the following table summarizes our effective tax rate income before income taxes and equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities net income loss attributable to noncontrolling interests total income tax expense effective tax rate for a reconciliation of the us federal tax rate to our effective income tax rate  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in  our effective tax rate increased by percentage points compared with  reflecting the net impact of a number of items 
state income taxes represented percentage points of our effective tax rate compared with percentage points in  due to a favorable impact from reducing accruals for state income taxes in that did not recur in second  in  we recorded an operating expense of million for penalties related to the timing of deposits for taxes withheld on stock option exercises 
this penalty is not deductible for income tax purposes and increased our effective tax rate by percentage points 
a third item that increased the effective tax rate in relates to disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options 
a disqualifying disposition occurs when the option holder sells shares within one year of exercising an incentive stock option 
we receive a cash tax benefit when a disqualifying disposition occurs 
a portion of this tax benefit is recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in our statement of income  reducing our effective income tax rate 
in  we adjusted the amount of the tax benefit recognized in our previous years statements of income related to disqualifying dispositions 
while this adjustment did not impact the amount of cash tax benefit we received for the disqualifying dispositions  it increased our effective tax rate by percentage points in as of december  all incentive stock options have been exercised  and therefore we do not expect that disqualifying dispositions will impact our effective tax rate in the future 
the million of operating expense related to adjusting the tax treatment of stock options originally considered incentive stock options increased the effective tax rate by percentage points  as these operating expenses are subject to deduction limitations for income tax purposes 
the above items  which increased our effective tax rate  were partially offset by three primary items 
first  research and development and foreign tax credits  some from previous years  reduced the effective tax rate by percentage points 
a reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions  primarily as a result of a lapse in the statute of limitations  also reduced our effective tax rate by percentage points in lastly  our income tax expense included a non cash tax benefit of million related to adjusting the treatment of stock options that were originally considered isos 
this tax benefit lowered the effective tax rate by percentage point 
in  our effective tax rate declined percentage points 
the effective tax rate reflects the favorable  but variable  benefit from incentive stock option transactions and a decrease in our us state tax rate following a change in state tax law 
these reductions were partially offset by an increase in liabilities for certain tax positions in the company s us and us operations 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards of million related to our non us operations and have recorded a valuation allowance against all but million of these nols 
because of the historical operating losses for certain non us operations  a valuation allowance is required because we do not believe that we will be able to use all of our non us nols 
certain positions we have taken or intend to take on our us and non us tax returns may be reviewed by tax authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of december   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million  if recognized  would reduce our effective income tax rate and decrease our income tax expense by million 
in  we expect changes to our liability for uncertain tax positions of approximately million for settlements with tax authorities 
it is not possible to estimate the impact of current audits on previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits 
we anticipate that our effective income tax rate may continue to fluctuate related to the creation or reversal of valuation allowances for our non us operations as well as to changes in unrecognized tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources we believe our available cash balances and investments  along with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating and cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we invest our cash reserves in cash equivalents and investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities 
we maintain a conservative investment policy for our investments  emphasizing principal preservation  and invest a portion of these assets in municipal securities with high quality stand alone credit ratings 
investments in our portfolio have a maximum maturity of two years  the weighted average maturity is approximately one year 
we intend to use our cash  cash equivalents  and investments for general corporate purposes  including for working capital and for funding future growth 
to date we have not needed to access any significant commercial credit and have not attempted to borrow or establish any lines of credit 
over the past three years  we invested million for acquisitions  less cash acquired  with internally generated funds 
graphic cash  cash equivalents  and investments as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million  an increase of million compared with december  this increase mainly reflects cash provided by operating activities and proceeds received from employee stock option exercises  partially offset by payments for acquisitions and capital expenditures 
we used a portion of our cash and investments balances in the first quarter of to make annual bonus payments of approximately million 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we paid million to one former and two current executives  related to adjusting the tax treatment of certain stock options originally considered incentive stock options 
we expect that this payment will be partially offset by a cash tax benefit in the future 
cash provided by operating activities our main source of capital is cash generated from operating activities 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million driven by million of net income adjusted for non cash items partially offset by million in changes from our net operating assets and liabilities  mainly driven by bonus payments 
we paid million for bonuses in  including million in deferred payments from the cash flow impact of these payments was partially offset by the cash flow benefit from accrued compensation for the bonuses 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  driven by million of net income adjusted for non cash items and million of changes in our net operating assets and liabilities 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities mainly benefited from a million increase in deferred rent related to tenant improvement allowances received in connection with the build out of our new headquarters  a million increase in accrued compensation  and a million increase in income taxes payable 
bonus payments of approximately million and tax payments of million offset these cash flow benefits 
in  cash provided by operating activities was million  driven by net income adjusted for non cash items of million  and changes in our net operating assets and liabilities of million 
changes in net operating assets mainly benefited from a million increase in accrued compensation and a million increase in income taxes payable 
these benefits were offset by bonus payments of million and tax payments of million 
graphic cash used for investing activities cash used for investing activities consists primarily of cash used for acquisitions  purchases of investments net of proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments  and capital expenditures 
the level of cash used for investing activities can vary from period to period depending on the level of activity in these three categories 
cash used for investing activities was million in  million in  and million in cash used for acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  was million 
we completed six acquisitions in the majority of the cash used for acquisitions was related to our purchase of logical information machines  inc and our acquisition of the equity research and data business of cpms computerized portfolio management services  inc in  cash used for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  of million 
the majority of this amount pertains to our acquisition of the hemscott data  media  and investor relations website businesses and tenfore systems limited 
cash used for acquisitions in  net of cash acquired  was million  primarily related to our acquisition of the fund data business from standard poor s 
purchases of investments  net of proceeds from the maturity or sale of investments  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had investments  consisting primarily of fixed income securities  of million and million  respectively 
as of december   our investments represented approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents  and investments  up percentage points compared with december   primarily due to the significant cash outflow for the purchase of logical information machines  inc on december  capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
capital expenditures peaked in when we paid for the build out of our new headquarters in chicago 
some of the cash outlay for this investment continued into capital expenditures in also include investment for a couple of our office locations in europe 
tenant improvement allowances of million  which are included in cash provided by operating activities  reduced the total amount of cash we paid for the build out in we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in  primarily for leasehold improvements and computer equipment 
in  we used cash of approximately million to acquire minority equity stakes in pitchbook data  a private equity data provider  and bundle corporation  a start up company dedicated to helping people make smarter spending and saving choices 
this amount also includes the cash we paid to increase our ownership interest in morningstar korea  making it one of our majority owned operations 
cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units 
excess tax benefits occur at the time a stock option is exercised when the intrinsic value of the option the difference between the fair value of our stock on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the option is greater than the fair value of the option at the time of grant 
similarly  the vesting of restricted stock units generates excess tax benefits when the market value of our common stock on the vesting date exceeds the grant price of the restricted stock units 
these excess tax benefits reduce the cash we pay for income taxes in the year they are recognized 
it is not possible to predict the timing of stock option exercises or the intrinsic value that will be achieved at the time options are exercised or upon vesting of restricted stock units 
as a result  we expect cash flow from financing activities to vary over time 
note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements includes additional information concerning stock options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december  in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled million 
in  cash provided by financing activities decreased by million  or  compared with  driven mostly by a million decline in excess tax benefits  and to a lesser extent by a million decline in proceeds from stock option exercises 
the decrease mainly reflects a lower average stock price at the time the stock options were exercised and a decrease in the number of options exercised 
in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
proceeds from stock option exercises totaled million and excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units totaled million 
in  cash provided by financing activities decreased by million  or  compared with  driven mostly by a million decline in excess tax benefits 
the decrease was due primarily to a lower average stock price at the time the stock options were exercised 
employees exercised approximately million  million  and million stock options in   and  respectively 
the total intrinsic value of options exercised during   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
acquisitions we invested a total of million  less cash acquired  related to acquisitions over the past three years 
we describe these acquisitions  including purchase price and product offerings  in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent event see note in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information on events subsequent to december  application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
we discuss our significant accounting policies in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management team to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense  and related disclosures included in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results could vary from these estimates and assumptions 
if actual amounts are different from previous estimates  we include revisions in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition much of our revenue comes from the sale of subscriptions or licenses for print publications  software  and internet based products and services 
we recognize this revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription or license  which generally ranges from one to three years 
we also provide analysis  consulting  retirement advice  and other services 
we recognize this revenue when the service is provided or during the service obligation period defined in the contract 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition  including whether fees are fixed or determinable and whether the collection of payment is probable 
for contracts that combine multiple products and services  we make judgments regarding the value of each element in the arrangement based on selling prices of the items when sold separately 
delivery of our products and services is a prerequisite to the recognition of revenue 
if arrangements include an acceptance provision  we begin recognizing revenue upon the receipt of customer acceptance 
deferred revenue is the amount invoiced or collected in advance for subscriptions  licenses  or services that has not yet been recognized as revenue 
as of december   our deferred revenue was million 
we expect to recognize this deferred revenue in future periods as we fulfill our service obligations 
the amount of deferred revenue may increase or decrease primarily based on the mix of contracted products and services and the volume of new and renewal subscriptions 
the timing of future revenue recognition may change depending on the terms of the license agreements and the timing of fulfilling our service obligations 
we believe that the estimate related to revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate  and to the extent that there are material differences between our determination of deferred revenue and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
purchase price allocation over the past several years  we have acquired several companies that complement our business operations 
over the past three years  the total cash paid for acquisitions  less cash acquired  was million 
for each acquisition  we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and goodwill in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations 
we recognize the assets and liabilities acquired related to these acquisitions at their estimated fair values 
as of december   we allocated million of gross value to intangible assets  primarily for customer related assets  technology based assets  and intellectual property 
the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets range from one to years 
as of december   we also have recorded million of goodwill arising from acquisitions 
management judgment is required in allocating the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities 
we use judgment to identify the acquired assets  estimate the fair value of these assets  estimate the useful life of the assets  and assess the appropriate method for recognizing depreciation or amortization expense over the asset s useful life 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to purchase price allocations are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions impact the amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities presented in our consolidated balance sheets  the amount of amortization and depreciation expense  if any  recorded in our consolidated statements of income  and the impairment testing performed in subsequent periods 
goodwill goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million 
in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  it is subject to at least an annual test for impairment  or whenever indicators of impairment exist  based on a discounted cash flow model 
an impairment would occur if the carrying amount of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeded the fair value of that reporting unit 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment 
in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows of the reporting unit 
these estimates include assumptions about future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  capital investments  appropriate discount rates  and other variables that can significantly affect the value of the reporting unit 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over a long term horizon 
we update these assumptions and cash flow estimates at least annually 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions used are highly susceptible to changes in the operating results and cash flows of the reporting units included in our segments 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future tests may indicate an impairment of goodwill 
this would result in a non cash charge  adversely affecting our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes property  equipment  and capitalized software  net of accumulated depreciation  of million and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
in accordance with fasb asc  subsequent measurement impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our property  equipment  capitalized software  and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such events or changes may include deterioration in the business climate for a specific product or service 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of an asset  we may need to record an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of future cash flows and the estimated useful lives associated with these assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
they are susceptible to change from period to period because of the requirement to make assumptions about future cash flows generated over extended periods of time 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and could adversely affect our operating results in the related period 
stock based compensation we include stock based compensation expense in each of our operating expense categories 
over the past three years  we have mainly granted restricted stock units rsus to employees 
because of these additional rsu grants  stock based compensation expense related to rsus has increased over the past three years 
in contrast  stock based compensation expense related to stock options has declined over the past three years reflecting no stock option grants in and  a small grant in  and that stock options granted prior to were fully expensed by the end of under fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
we measure the fair value of our restricted stock units on the date of grant based on the market price of the underlying common stock as of the close of trading on the day prior to grant 
for stock options  we measured the fair value on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
we estimate expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the grant date and recognize compensation cost only for those awards expected to vest 
we ultimately adjust this forfeiture assumption to the actual forfeiture rate 
therefore  changes in the forfeiture assumptions do not impact the total amount of expense ultimately recognized over the vesting period 
instead  different forfeiture assumptions would only impact the timing of expense recognition over the vesting period 
because our largest annual equity grants typically have vesting dates in the second quarter of the year  we adjust the stock based compensation expense at that time to reflect those awards that ultimately vested 
in addition  we update our estimate of the forfeiture rate that will be applied to awards not yet vested 
in and  we recorded approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense related to these changes in estimates 
we believe that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in our us and us operations  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required to evaluate our tax positions 
tax law requires us to include items in our tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in our consolidated income statement 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  are permanent 
other differences  such as depreciation expense  reverse over time 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units also create a difference between our cash tax rate and the effective tax rate in our consolidated income statement 
as of december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million and gross deferred tax liabilities of million 
the deferred tax assets include million of deferred tax assets related to million of nols of our non us operations 
because of the historical operating losses of certain of the non us operations that generated these nols  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all but approximately million of the nols  reflecting the likelihood that the benefit of the nols will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if we determine a lesser allowance is required at some point in the future  we would record a reduction to our tax expense and valuation allowance 
these adjustments would be made in the same period we determined the change in the valuation allowance was needed 
this would cause our income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
we assess uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
we use judgment to identify  recognize  and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize liabilities to represent our potential future obligations to taxing authorities for the benefits taken in our tax returns 
we adjust these liabilities  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
we use judgment to classify unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
we generally classify liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits as noncurrent liabilities 
it typically takes several years between our initial tax return filing and the final resolution of any uncertain tax positions with the tax authority 
we recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established reserves as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to legal proceedings and investigations  which we describe in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
these legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including  but not limited to  court rulings  negotiations between affected parties  and government actions 
assessing the probability of loss for such contingencies and determining how to accrue the appropriate liabilities requires judgment 
if actual results differ from our assessments  our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows would be impacted 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 transfers and servicing topic accounting for transfers of financial assets and asu no 
 consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
these accounting pronouncements change the way entities account for transfers of financial assets and determine what entities must be consolidated 
the most significant amendment resulting from asu no 
consists of the removal of the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity qspe from asc  transfers and services 
asu no 
addresses the effects of eliminating the qspe concept from asc  transfers and services  and responds to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of asc  consolidation  including concerns over the transparency of enterprises involvement with variable interest entities vies 
we adopted asu no 
and asu no 
effective january  and do not anticipate any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu supersedes eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
asu establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements when a vendor performs multiple revenue generating activities  addresses how to separate deliverables  and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration 
vendors often provide multiple products or services to customers 
because products and services are often provided at different points in time or over different time periods within the same contractual arrangement  this guidance enables vendors to account for products or services separately rather than as a combined unit 
also in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and affects vendors that sell or lease tangible products in an arrangement that contains software that is more than incidental to the tangible product as a whole 
asu no 
does not affect software revenue arrangements that do not include tangible products 
they also do not affect software revenue arrangements that include services if the software is essential to the functionality of those services 
for morningstar  asu no 
and asu no 
will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into from january  early adoption is permitted 
we are in the process of determining the impact  if any  these accounting standard updates will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
asu no 
requires additional disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
the amended guidance requires entities to disclose additional information regarding assets and liabilities that are transferred between levels of the fair value hierarchy 
entities are also required to disclose information in the level rollforward about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis 
in addition to these new disclosure requirements  asu also amends topic to further clarify existing guidance pertaining to the level of disaggregation at which fair value disclosures should be made and the disclosure requirements regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used in estimating level and level fair value measurements 
for morningstar  the requirement to disclose additional information regarding assets and liabilities that are transferred between levels of the fair value hierarchy will be effective beginning with our consolidated financial statements 
the requirement to separately disclose purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the level rollforward will be effective beginning with our consolidated financial statements 
we are in the process of determining the impact  if any  these accounting pronouncements will have on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the table below shows our known contractual obligations as of december  and the expected timing of cash payments related to these contractual obligations thereafter total minimum commitments on non cancelable operating lease obligations unrecognized tax benefits total the non cancelable operating lease obligations are mainly for lease commitments for office space 
represents unrecognized tax benefits including penalties and interest  less the impact of any associated tax benefits recorded in accordance with fasb asc  income taxes 
the amount included in the table represents amounts we anticipate may be settled in the table excludes million of unrecognized tax benefits  included as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of payment 
there are no purchase commitments as of december  that we believe would have a significant impact on our financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio is actively managed and may suffer losses from fluctuating interest rates  market prices  or adverse security selection 
our investment portfolio is mainly invested in high quality fixed income securities 
we do not have any direct exposure to sub prime mortgages 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and investments balance was million 
based on our estimates  a basis point change in interest rates would have increased or decreased the fair value of our investment portfolio by approximately million 
as our non us revenue increases as a percentage of our consolidated revenue  fluctuations in foreign currencies present a greater potential risk 
to date  we have not engaged in currency hedging  and we do not currently have any positions in derivative instruments to hedge our currency risk 
our results could suffer if certain foreign currencies decline relative to the us dollar 
in addition  because we use the local currency of our subsidiaries as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars
