managed health care operations we offer a full spectrum of managed health care products and services 
our strategy is to offer to employers and individuals managed health care products and services that  among other things  provide comprehensive coverage and manage health care costs 
our health plans offer members coverage for a wide range of health care services including ambulatory and outpatient physician care  hospital care  pharmacy services  behavioral health and ancillary diagnostic and therapeutic services 
our health plans include a matrix package  which allows members to select their desired coverage from a variety of alternatives 
our principal commercial health care products are as follows hmo plans our hmo plans offer comprehensive benefits generally through contracts with participating network physicians  hospitals and other providers 
when an individual enrolls in one of our hmo plans  he or she may select a primary care physician pcp from among the physicians participating in our network 
pcps generally are family practitioners  general practitioners or pediatricians who provide necessary preventive and primary medical care  and are generally responsible for coordinating other necessary health care services  including making referrals to participating network specialists 
we offer hmo plans with differing benefit designs and varying levels of co payments that result in different levels of premium rates 
in california  participating providers are typically contracted through medical groups 
in those cases  enrollees in hmo plans are generally required to secure specialty professional services from physicians in the group  as long as such services are available from group physicians 
ppo plans our ppo plans offer coverage for services received from any health care provider  with benefits generally paid at a higher level when care is received from a participating network provider 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and co payments or coinsurance 
indemnity plans our indemnity plans offer the member the ability to select any health care provider for covered services 
some care management features may be included in these plans  such as inpatient precertification  disease management programs and benefits for preventive services 
coverage typically is subject to deductibles and coinsurance

pos enrollees choose  each time they receive care  from conventional hmo or indemnity like in network and out of network coverage  with payments and or reimbursement depending on the coverage chosen 
we assume both underwriting and administrative expense risk in return for the premium revenue we receive from our hmo  pos and ppo products

table of contents we submitted our final proposal to the department of defense for the third generation of tricare managed care support contracts referred to as t on january   and on july  we were notified by the department of defense that we were not selected to be the managed care support contractor under the t contract for the north region 
on july  we filed a protest with the government accountability office gao in connection with the t award decision made by the tricare management authority tma citing a procurement integrity act violation by the department of defense in releasing our initial proposed bid price to the public  including through its website 
on july   the department of defense conducted a debriefing of the proposal evaluation and the basis for the award decision 
on july   we filed a second protest with the gao in connection with the t award decision  citing flaws in the proposal evaluation and award decision and other grounds for protest 
the filing of our timely protest triggered an automatic suspension of the performance of the t north region contract until the protest was decided by the gao 
this effectively stopped performance on the implementation of the t north contract 
also  the department of defense has indicated that  if transition work is resumed  the t north contractor will be given a ten month transition period prior to the start of health care delivery under the t north contract 
however  the department of defense always has the authority to shorten the transition period to less than ten months 
on october   the gao rendered a decision denying our july  protest  and on november   the gao rendered a decision upholding our july  protest 
the gao sustained our july  protest on six grounds  including the appearance of impropriety based on an unfair competitive advantage stemming from the t contract awardee s use of a former high level government employee in preparing its proposal and such individual s access to non public proprietary information concerning our incumbent contract 
the gao recommended that tma conduct a new evaluation of the award of the t contract 
with respect to the alleged unfair competitive advantage  gao recommended that the contracting officer perform a thorough review regarding the scope of the former tma employee s access to non public proprietary information and source selection sensitive information  which could have afforded the t contract awardee a competitive advantage in the preparation of its t proposal 
the gao recommended that the contracting officer determine which actions  if any  should be taken to address the appearance of impropriety stemming from that individual s participation in the preparation of the t contract awardee s t proposal 
regarding the other issues upon which the protest was sustained  the gao recommended that tma re evaluate the proposals consistent with the opinion and make a new source selection decision 
on december   tma sent a letter to the gao indicating that it accepted the gao s recommendations and would take the requested corrective action 
specifically  tma stated that it would prepare appropriate corrective action to address the flaws identified in the gao decision  but only after the department of defense completed its review of the unfair competitive advantage issue and actions  if any  necessary to address the appearance of impropriety 
the department of defense did not provide a timeline for concluding its review 
at this time  we are not able to determine what specific actions the department of defense will take in response to recommendations by the gao  nor can we determine whether or not the protest decision by the gao will have any effect upon the ultimate outcome of the contract award

provider relationships we maintain a network of qualified physicians  hospitals and other health care providers in each of the states in which we offer network based managed care products and services 
physician relationships the following table sets forth the number of primary care and specialist physicians contracted either directly with our hmos or through our contracted participating physician groups ppgs as of december  primary care physicians includes both hmo and ppo physicians specialist physicians includes both hmo and ppo physicians total under our california hmo and pos plans  all members are required to select a ppg and generally also a primary care physician from within that group 
in our other plans  including all of our plans outside of california  members may be required to select a primary care physician from the broader hmo network panel of primary care physicians 
the primary care physicians and ppgs assume overall responsibility for the care of members 
medical care provided directly by such physicians includes the treatment of illnesses not requiring referral  and may include physical examinations  routine immunizations  maternity and childcare  and other preventive health services 
the primary care physicians and ppgs are responsible for making referrals approved by the hmo s or ppg s medical director as required under the terms of our various plans to specialists and hospitals

ppg and physician contracts are generally for a period of at least one year and are automatically renewable unless terminated  with certain requirements for maintenance of good professional standing and compliance with our quality  utilization and administrative procedures

under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a 
table of contents fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services 
the capitation fee represents payment in full for all medical and ancillary services specified in the provider agreements 
in these capitation fee arrangements  in cases where the capitated ppg cannot provide the health care services needed  such ppgs generally contract with specialists and other ancillary service providers to furnish the requisite services under capitation agreements or negotiated fee schedules with specialists 
outside of california  most of our hmos reimburse physicians according to a discounted fee for service schedule  although several have capitation arrangements with certain providers and provider groups in their market areas 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in our ppo plans  members are not required to select a primary care physician and generally do not require prior authorization for specialty care 
for services provided under our ppo products and the out of network benefits of our pos products  we ordinarily reimburse physicians pursuant to discounted fee for service arrangements 
hnfs maintains a network of qualified physicians  facilities  and ancillary providers in the prime service areas of our tricare contract for the north region 
services are provided on a fee for service basis 
as of december   hnfs had  physicians   facilities  and  ancillary providers in its tricare network 
our behavioral health subsidiary  mhn  maintains a provider network comprised of approximately  psychiatrists  psychologists and other clinical categories of providers nationwide 
substantially all of these providers are contracted with mhn on an individual or small practice group basis and are paid on a discounted fee for service basis 
members who wish to access certain behavioral health services contact mhn and are referred to contracted providers for evaluation or treatment services 
generally  authorization for such services is for a limited number of appointments and must be renewed by mhn based on medical necessity 
if a member needs inpatient services  mhn maintains a network of approximately  facilities 
in addition to the physicians that are in our networks  we have also entered into agreements with various third parties that have networks of physicians contracted to them third party networks 
in general  under a third party network arrangement  health net is licensed by the third party to access its network providers and pay the claims of these physicians pursuant to the pricing terms of their contracts with the third party network 
hospital relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for hospital care primarily through contracts with selected hospitals in their service areas 
these hospital contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
covered hospital based care for our members is comprehensive 
it includes the services of hospital based physicians  nurses and other hospital personnel  room and board  intensive care  laboratory and x ray services  diagnostic imaging and generally all other services normally provided by acute care hospitals 
our nurses and medical directors are involved in a wide variety of medical management activities on behalf of our hmo and  to a somewhat lesser extent  ppo members 
these activities can include discharge planning and case management  which often involves the coordination of community support services  including visiting nurses  physical therapy  durable medical equipment and home intravenous therapy 

table of contents ancillary and other provider relationships our health plan subsidiaries arrange for ancillary and other provider services  such as ambulance  laboratory  radiology  home health  chiropractic and acupuncture primarily through contracts with selected providers in their service areas 
these contracts generally have multi year terms or annual terms with automatic renewals and provide for payments on a variety of bases  including capitation  per diem rates  case rates and discounted fee for service schedules 
in certain cases  these provider services are included in contracts our health plan subsidiaries have with ppgs and hospitals 
see item a 
risk factors if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers that we contract with  our profitability could be adversely affected for additional information on the risks associated with our provider relationships 
additional information concerning our business competition we operate in a highly competitive environment in an industry currently subject to significant changes from business consolidations  new strategic alliances  legislative reform and market pressures brought about by a better informed and better organized customer base 
our health plans face substantial competition from for profit and nonprofit hmos  ppos  self funded plans including self insured employers and union trust funds  blue cross blue shield plans  and traditional indemnity insurance carriers  some of which have substantially larger enrollments and greater financial resources than we do 
the development and growth of companies offering internet based connections between health care professionals  employers and members  along with a variety of services  could also create additional competitors 
we believe that the principal competitive features affecting our ability to retain and increase membership include the range and prices of benefit plans offered  size and quality of provider network  quality of service  responsiveness to user demands  financial stability  comprehensiveness of coverage  diversity of product offerings  and market presence and reputation 
the relative importance of each of these factors and the identity of our key competitors vary by market 
over the past several years  a health plan s ability to interact with employers  members and other third parties including health care professionals via the internet has become a more important competitive factor 
to that end  we continue to make technology investments to enhance our electronic interactions with third parties 
we believe that we compete effectively against other health care industry participants in our west operations segment 
our primary competitors in california are kaiser permanente  anthem blue cross of california  unitedhealth group  inc and blue shield of california 
together  these four plans and health net account for a majority of the insured market in california 
kaiser is the largest hmo in california based on number of enrollees and anthem blue cross of california is the largest ppo provider in california based on number of enrollees 
there are also a number of small  regional based health plans that compete with health net in california  mainly in the small business group market segment 
in addition  two of the major national managed care companies  aetna  inc and cigna corp  are active in california 
their respective commercial full risk market share is not as significant as our primary competitors in california and we believe that each remains in california primarily to serve their national  self funded accounts california employees 
our largest competitor in arizona is unitedhealth group  inc our arizona hmo also competes with blue cross blue shield of arizona  cigna  aetna and humana inc our oregon health plan competes primarily with kaiser  unitedhealth group  providence  regence blue cross blue shield  pacificsource  lifewise and ods health plans  inc marketing and sales we market our products and services to individuals and employer groups through inside sales staff  independent brokers  agents and consultants and through the internet 
for our group health business  we market 
table of contents our products and services utilizing a three step process 
we first market to potential employer groups  group insurance brokers and consultants 
we then provide information directly to employees once the employer has selected our health coverage 
finally  we engage members and employers in marketing for member and group retention 
for our small group business  members are enrolled by their employer based on the plan chosen by the employer 
in general  once selected by a large employer group  we solicit enrollees from the employee base directly 
during open enrollment periods when employees are permitted to change health care programs  we use a variety of techniques to attract new enrollees and retain existing members  including  without limitation  direct mail  work day and health fair presentations and telemarketing 
our sales efforts are supported by our marketing division  which engages in product research and development  multicultural marketing  advertising and communications  and member education and retention programs 
premiums for each employer group are generally contracted on a yearly basis and are payable monthly 
we consider numerous factors in setting our monthly premiums  including employer group needs and anticipated health care utilization rates as forecasted by us based on the demographic composition of  and our prior experience in  our service areas 
premiums are also affected by applicable state and federal law and regulations that may directly or indirectly affect premium setting 
for example  california law prohibits experience rating of small group accounts taking the group s past health care utilization and costs into consideration 
mandated benefits requiring the coverage of certain benefits as a matter of law  whether desired by the group or not also affect premiums 
for example  in california and elsewhere  mental health parity laws have generally broadened mental health benefits under health insurance policies offered by us and other carriers 
in some of our markets we sell individual policies  which are generally sold through independent brokers and agents 
in some states including california and for certain products  carriers are allowed to individually underwrite these policies ie select applicants to whom coverage will be provided and others who are denied  although in other states there may be a requirement of guaranteed issue with respect to certain lines of business that restricts the carrier s discretion 
in guaranteed issue states  exclusions for preexisting conditions are generally permitted 
in california  current law and regulations allow carriers to individually underwrite policies sold to individual and families  as well as large groups  but small group policies may not be underwritten 
the completion of customary underwriting procedures may be a prerequisite to the carrier s exercise of any cancellation or rescission right with respect to an issued policy  and the public interest in this practice has caused and may continue to cause additional legislation  regulation and the development of case law which may further restrict carriers in this regard 
we believe that the importance of the ultimate health care consumer or member in the health care product purchasing process is likely to increase in the future  particularly in light of advances in technology and online resources 
accordingly  we are focusing our marketing strategies on the development of distinct brand identities and innovative product service offerings that will appeal to potential health plan members 
for example  decision power sm is a series of programs designed to more directly involve patients in their health care decisions 
these programs allow our members to access information and consult with health coaches as they are making decisions regarding health care issues 
as more employers begin to offer consumer directed health plans such as health savings accounts hsas and health reimbursement accounts hras  we believe consumers need to be able to learn  plan and make complex decisions regarding their health care 
our website combines access to current health net and vendor content and tools 
information technology in  we continued our multi year effort to consolidate claim processes across the enterprise  improve enterprise data analytics and consolidate service centers and associated staff 
we also completed significant it applications and infrastructure outsourcing work that has enabled us to improve claim turnaround times  auto adjudication rates  electronic data interchange and internet capabilities 
the transition to the outsourced it operating model was also the first phase of our three phased plan designed to enhance our it service delivery  increase our agility and improve our decision making capability 
we have initiated the second phase of our it systems improvement strategy  technology optimization  to simplify 
table of contents and improve our technology environment  and to provide technology renewal for desktops  networks  and servers 
in  we made significant progress in improving our technology platform by renewing technology and initiating the transition of our data center operations to a third party vendor 
we expect to complete the move of our data center operations to our third party vendor in early technology renewal and optimization initiatives will continue throughout additionally  we will begin work in on the third phase of our it strategy  a multi year effort to evolve and advance our business process and business service focused systems  and to modernize our information systems  applications and enterprise architecture 
this work will support industry imperatives  position us for potential health care reform  improve our overall ability to respond to changes in the marketplace  and make it easier to do business with us 
however  there are risks associated with these efforts  including the risks associated with moving our data center operations to a third party vendor 
see item a 
risk factors if we fail to effectively maintain our management information systems  it could adversely affect our business and we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
medical management we believe that managing health care costs is an essential function for a managed care company 
among the medical management techniques we utilize to contain the growth of health care costs are pre authorization or certification for outpatient and inpatient hospitalizations and a concurrent review of active inpatient hospital stays and discharge planning 
we believe that this authorization process reduces inappropriate use of medical resources and achieves efficiencies in referring cases to the most appropriate providers 
we also contract with third parties to manage certain conditions such as neonatal intensive care unit admissions and stays  as well as chronic conditions such as asthma  diabetes and congestive heart failure 
these techniques are widely used in the managed care industry and are accepted practices in the medical profession 
accreditation we pursue accreditation for certain of our health plans from the national committee for quality assurance ncqa and the utilization review accreditation commission urac 
ncqa and urac are independent  non profit organizations that review and accredit hmos and other healthcare organizations 
hmos that comply with review requirements and quality standards receive accreditation 
the commercial lines of business of our arizona and california hmo subsidiaries have both received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent  which is the highest score ncqa awards 
hn california s medicare and medicaid lines of business also received ncqa accreditation with a score of excellent 
our mhn subsidiary has received urac accreditation 
government regulation our business is subject to comprehensive federal regulation and state regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
these laws and regulations govern how we conduct our businesses and result in additional requirements  restrictions and costs to us 
we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all current state and federal laws and regulations applicable to our businesses 
certain of these laws and regulations are discussed below 
federal legislation and regulation medicare legislation and regulation 
comprehensive legislation  including the mma and the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of mippa  governs our medicare program 
in addition  our medicare contracts and our provision of administrative services pursuant to the united administrative services agreements are subject to regulation by cms 
cms has the right to audit medicare contractors and the health care providers and administrative contractors who provide certain services on their behalf to determine the quality of care being rendered and the degree of compliance with cms contracts and regulations 

table of contents in response to mippa  cms promulgated regulations governing the marketing and sale of medicare advantage and pdp products 
these regulations prohibit certain marketing activities by contracted and in house sales producers  including outbound calling  and place new requirements on amounts and duration of compensation payable to contracted producers 
we could be subject to monetary and other sanctions by cms for a contracted or in house sales producer s violation of these regulations 
in late  cms performed a routine audit of certain of our medicare advantage  private fee for service and pdp products and found deficiencies in many of the business areas included in the review 
on august   cms accepted our corrective action plan relating to the audit 
in december  cms performed a focused audit to assess our implementation of the corrective action plan 
we received cms report on the focused audit and related corrective action request on january  and submitted our corrective action plan to cms for review and approval on february  cms found deficiencies in many of the business areas included in the review  including several repeat findings from previous audits  which were submitted to cms central office for review 
on january   we were notified by cms that  due to certain pharmacy claims processing errors  none of our stand alone pdp plans would be considered available for the purposes of the process through which cms randomly assigns low income subsidy lis eligible medicare beneficiaries not otherwise enrolled in pdp plans into stand alone pdp plans  effective february  in its notice to us  cms indicated that it would work with us to develop a corrective action plan in this regard  but at this time  we have not received a corrective action request from cms 
see item a 
risk factors federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations for description of the risks associated with the cms audit and the suspension of our auto enrollment for lis beneficiaries 
medicaid and related legislation 
federal law has also implemented other health programs that are partially funded by the federal government  such as the medicaid program known as medi cal in california and chip known as healthy families in california 
our medi cal program is regulated and administered by the california department of health care services and healthy families is regulated by the managed risk medical insurance board 
our provision of administrative services to united and certain of its affiliates pursuant to the united administrative services agreements is subject to regulation by the new jersey department of human services and division of medical assistance and health services 
federal funding remains critical to the viability of these programs  particularly in light of california s state budget deficits 
federal law permits the federal government to oversee and  in some cases  to enact  regulations and other requirements that must be followed by california 
medicaid is administered at the federal level by cms  chip is administered by the health resources and services administration  another arm of the department of health and human services 
privacy regulations 
the use  disclosure and maintenance of individually identifiable health information and other data by our businesses is regulated by various laws at the federal  state and local level 
these laws and regulations are changed frequently by legislation or administrative interpretation 
most of those laws are derived from health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and the privacy provisions in the federal gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of the gramm leach bliley act  although there are an increasing number of state laws that require notification to individuals and regulatory authorities in the event of a security breach and that specifically regulate the use and disclosure of social security numbers 
hipaa and the implementing regulations that have been adopted in connection therewith impose obligations for group health plans and issuers of health insurance coverage such as health insurers and health maintenance organizations relating to the privacy and security of protected health information including electronically transmitted protected health information collectively  phi 
the regulations  which relate to the privacy and security of phi  require health plans  health care clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage and disclosure of phi  
table of contents adopt rigorous internal procedures to protect phi  create policies related to the privacy of phi  enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed  and notify individuals and regulatory authorities if phi is compromised 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
recent developments in this area include the health information technology for economic and clinical health hitech act  which became fully effective in february  the hitech act expands the hipaa rules for security and privacy safeguards  including improved enforcement  additional limitations on use and disclosure of phi and additional potential penalties for non compliance 
see item a 
risk factors if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected for additional information on a recent information security breach 
the gramm leach bliley act generally requires insurers to provide customers with notice regarding how their personal health and financial information is used and the opportunity to opt out of certain disclosures before the insurer shares non public personal information with a non affiliated third party 
like hipaa  this law sets a floor standard  allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection 
erisa 
most employee benefit plans are regulated by the federal government under the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa 
employment based health coverage is such an employee benefit plan 
erisa is administered  in large part  by the us department of labor dol 
erisa contains disclosure requirements for documents that define the benefits and coverage 
it also contains a provision that causes federal law to preempt state law in the regulation and governance of certain benefit plans and employer groups  including the availability of legal remedies under state law 
other federal regulations 
we must comply with  and are affected by  laws and regulations relating to the award  administration and performance of us government contracts 
government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and  in some instances  impose added costs on our business 
a violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts 
state laws and regulations our west operations hmos  insurance companies and behavioral health plan are subject to extensive state regulation 
set forth below are the principal regulatory agencies that govern these health plans and insurance companies 
company regulatory agency arizona hmo arizona department of insurance california hmo california department of managed health care oregon hmo oregon department of consumer and business services health net life insurance company arizona and california ppo california department of insurance generally  and the department of insurance of each state in which it does business mhn california department of managed health care  new york department of insurance 
table of contents additionally  the administrative services that we provide to united and certain of its affiliates as part of our northeast operations are subject to state laws and regulations 
the connecticut department of insurance  the new jersey department of banking and insurance  the new jersey department of human services and division of medical assistance and health services for medicaid only  the new york department of insurance and the new york department of health are the principal state regulatory agencies that govern our provision of administrative services in the northeast pursuant to the united administrative services agreements 
for additional information about our northeast operations segment  see northeast operations segment 
insurance and hmo laws impose a number of financial requirements and restrictions on our regulated subsidiaries  which vary from state to state 
they generally include certain minimum capital and deposit and or reserve requirements  restrictions on dividends and other distributions to the parent corporations and affiliated corporations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources statutory capital requirements 
these financial requirements are subject to change  which may require us to commit additional capital to certain regulated subsidiaries or may limit our ability to move capital through dividends and other distributions 
while there are state by state variations  hmo regulation generally is extremely comprehensive 
among the areas regulated by these hmo regulatory agencies are adequacy of financial resources  network of health care providers and administrative operations  sales and enrollment requirements  disclosure documents and notice requirements  product offerings  including the scope of mandatory benefits and required offerings of benefits that are optional coverages  procedures for member grievance resolution and medical necessity determinations  accessibility of providers  handling of provider claims including out of network claims and adherence to timely and accurate payment and appeal rules  and linguistic and cultural accessibility standards  governance requirements and reporting requirements 
ppo regulation also varies by state  and while these regulations generally cover all or most of the subject areas referred to above  the regulation of ppo products and carriers tends to be less intensive than regulation of hmos 
variations in state regulation also arise in connection with the intensity of government oversight 
variations include the need to file or have affirmatively approved certain proposals before use or implementation by the health plan  the degree of review and comment by the regulatory agency  the amount and type of reporting by the health plan to the regulatory agency  the extent and frequency of audit or other examination  and the authority and extent of investigative activity  enforcement action  corrective action authority  and penalties and fines 
our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to legal restrictions on our ability to price some of our products 
some products may be subject to regulatory approval of premium levels 
generally  insurance and hmo laws require premiums to be established at amounts reasonably related to our costs 
pending federal and state legislation there are a number of other legislative initiatives and proposed regulations currently pending or previously proposed at the federal and state levels which could increase regulation of  and costs incurred by  the health care industry 
for example  the united states senate and house of representatives recently passed separate bills relating to health care reform 
these bills have not yet been reconciled with each other or signed into law 
these measures and other initiatives  if enacted  could have significant adverse effects on our operations 
see item a 
risk factors potential health care reform legislation being considered by congress may adversely affect us 
table of contents and changes to federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of the pending legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulation 
intellectual property we have registered and maintain various service marks  trademarks and trade names that we use in our businesses  including marks and names incorporating the health net phrase  and from time to time we apply for additional registrations of such marks 
we utilize these and other marks and names in connection with the marketing and identification of products and services 
we believe such marks and names are valuable and material to our marketing efforts 
employees as of december   health net  inc and its subsidiaries employed  persons on a full time basis and persons on a part time or temporary basis 
these employees perform a variety of functions  including  among other things  provision of administrative services for employers  providers and members  negotiation of agreements with physician groups  hospitals  pharmacies and other health care providers  handling of claims for payment of hospital and other services  and provision of data processing services 
our employees are not unionized and we have not experienced any work stoppages since our inception 
we consider our relations with our employees to be very good 
dependence upon customers the federal government is the only customer of our government contracts segment  with premiums and fees accounting for of our government contracts revenue 
see item a 
risk factors a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the federal government is a significant customer of our west operations segment as a result of our contract with cms for coverage of medicare eligible individuals  including part d prescription plans  state agencies for federally subsidized medicaid and chip programs  and coverage of federal employees under the federal employees health benefits program 
medicare premiums accounted for of our total premium revenue in shareholder rights plan on july   our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan pursuant to a rights agreement with wells fargo bank  na the rights agent  dated as of july  the rights agreement

potential health care reform legislation being considered by congress may adversely affect us 
the issue of affordable health insurance and the challenge of covering the uninsured have generated significant amounts of public attention 
the united states senate and house of representatives passed separate health care reform bills in late these bills have not yet been reconciled or signed into law 
in addition  certain members of congress have proposed a single payer health care system  a government health insurance option to compete with private plans and other expanded public health care measures 
it is possible that any final health care reform legislation could include one or more of the following elements  some of which would change the dynamics of the health care industry requirement that health plans pay significantly higher taxes  including a special assessment or annual operating fee for health insurance providers to fund the legislation  an excise tax on high cost employer provider health coverage to fund the legislation  regulation of the individual coverage market by restricting or mandating premium levels or mandating coverage for individuals with pre existing medical conditions  restricting our underwriting discretion  or restricting our ability to rescind coverage based on a member s misrepresentations and omissions  require prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases  or other requirements that would limit the ability of health plans and insurers to vary premiums and or accurately price based on assessments of underlying risk  elimination of certain caps on health care coverage  a health care exchange to facilitate uninsured individuals access to health care coverage from private companies  and 
table of contents other steps to expand access to health insurance in a manner that significantly restricts a health insurer or health plan s ability to effectively manage risk and limits insurance company profitability  including by regulating the medical cost ratio 
we do not currently know what the ultimate outcome of the reconciliation process or the legislation will be 
any health care reform may be phased in over a number of years  but  if enacted and depending on the provisions contained in any final legislation  could have a material adverse impact on our business  cash flows  financial condition or results of operations 
changes to federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
the united states congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies frequently consider legislative proposals and regulatory initiatives that  if enacted  could materially affect the managed health care industry and the regulatory environment and could have material adverse effects on our operations  including subjecting us to additional restrictions on our business operations  regulatory compliance costs and litigation risk 
such measures have proposed  among other things  to restrict or eliminate health insurers and health plans in the marketplace  reduce government funding of government sponsored health programs in which we participate  like medicare advantage  mandate certain benefits and administrative or other services that could increase the cost of healthcare or administrative services  or restrict our right to manage the member s care through authorization requirements  requirements of medical necessity  or formularies for covered pharmaceuticals  restrict a health insurer or health plan s profitability or require health plans to pay significantly higher taxes  restrict our ability to contract with and manage access to providers and provider groups  enhance certain provider payments or appeal rights  or restrict our ability to select and terminate providers  and mandate certain grievance and appeal rights for our members or providers  including establishment of third party reviews of certain care decisions 
in addition to the managed care reform legislation being considered by congress  governors and state legislatures are considering various proposals to cover the uninsured in states where we conduct business  including california 
proposals under consideration at both the state and federal levels include  but are not limited to  restructuring the health insurance market to mandate coverage  imposing various taxes and fees on insurance companies and on insurance coverage and arrangements  guaranteeing insurance in the individual market  merging individual and small group markets  mandating minimum medical care ratios  placing a cap on premiums  requiring prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases or otherwise expanding access to health insurance in a manner that could limit the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products 
from time to time  congress also has considered various forms of managed care reform legislation which  if adopted  could fundamentally change the treatment of coverage decisions under erisa 
additionally  there is legislative interest in modifying erisa s preemptive effect on state laws and litigants ability to seek damages beyond the benefits offered under their health plans 
if adopted  such limitations could permit greater state regulation of our operations  could increase our liability exposure and could expand the scope of damages available to litigants 
we cannot predict the outcome of the legislative and regulatory proposals described above or any other such legislative or regulatory proposals  nor the extent to which we may be affected by the enactment of any such legislation or regulations 
such legislation or regulation  including measures that would cause us to change our 
table of contents current manner of operation or increase our exposure to liability  could have a material adverse effect on our business  cash flows  results of operations  financial condition and ability to compete in our industry 
our profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict and control health care costs 
a substantial majority of the revenue we receive is used to pay the costs of health care services and supplies delivered to our members 
the total amount of health care costs we incur is affected by the number and type of individual services provided and the cost of each service 
our future profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to accurately predict health care costs and to manage future health care utilization and costs through underwriting criteria  utilization management  product design and negotiation of favorable professional and hospital contracts 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts  coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups  may result in increased health care costs or limit our ability to negotiate favorable rates 
changes in utilization rates  demographic characteristics  the regulatory environment  including proposed restrictions on our ability to implement changes in premium rates  health care practices  inflation  new technologies  clusters of high cost cases  continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups and numerous other factors affecting health care costs may adversely affect our ability to predict and control health care costs as well as our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  a large scale public health epidemic could affect our ability to control health care costs 
see large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for several years  one of the fastest increasing categories of our health care costs has been the cost of hospital based products and services 
factors underlying the increase in hospital costs include  but are not limited to  the underfunding of public programs  such as medicaid and medicare and the constant pressure that places on rates from commercial health plans  growing rates of uninsured individuals  new technology  state initiated mandates  alleged abuse of hospital chargemasters  an aging population and  under certain circumstances  relatively low levels of hospital competition caused by market concentration 
another significant category of our health care costs is costs of pharmaceutical products and services 
factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include  but are not limited to  the price of drugs  utilization of new and existing drugs and changes in discounts 
as a measure of the impact of medical costs on our financial results  relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results 
for example  if medical costs increased by without a proportional change in related revenues for our health plan products  our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million 
the inability to forecast and manage our health care costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
our premium revenue is set in advance of the actual delivery of services  and  in certain circumstances  before contracting with providers 
while we attempt to take into account our estimate of expected health care costs over the premium period in setting the premiums we charge or bid  factors such as competition  new or changed regulations and other circumstances may limit our ability to fully base premiums on estimated costs 
in addition  many factors may  and often do  cause actual health care costs to exceed those costs estimated and reflected in premiums or bids 
these factors may include increased utilization of services  increased cost of individual services  catastrophes  epidemics  unanticipated seasonality  new mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  and insured population characteristics 
in addition  several states are considering legislative proposals to require prior regulatory approval of premium rate increases 
our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
table of contents by significant disparities between the premium increases of our health plans and those of our major competitors or by limitations on our ability to increase or maintain our premium levels 
in  we continued to see decreases in our total commercial membership as we sought to improve margins 
any future increase in premiums could result in the loss of members 
additionally  there is always the possibility that adverse risk selection could occur when members who utilize higher levels of health care services compared with the insured population as a whole choose to remain with our health plans rather than risk moving to another plan 
this could cause health care costs to be higher than anticipated and therefore cause our financial results to fall short of expectations 
in the various states in which we do business  premium prices are also constrained by state laws and regulations which restrict the spread between premiums and benefits  such as laws and regulations that require a minimum loss ratio of a certain percentage 
these laws and regulations not only restrict our ability to raise our premiums but also create competitive pressure from some of our competitors who may have lower health care costs than we have and therefore price their premiums at relatively low levels in relation to our cost of care 
as a result of the northeast sale  our business is regionally concentrated 
in the event our tricare north operations are discontinued  our business could become more regionally concentrated 
as a result of the northeast sale  our business operations are now concentrated in the states of california  arizona and oregon  and all of our medicaid operations are in the state of california 
due to this concentration in a small number of states  in particular  california  we are exposed to the risk of a deterioration in our financial results if our health plans in these states  in particular  california  experience significant losses 
in addition  our financial results could be adversely affected by economic conditions in these states 
if the economic conditions in the state of california or in the other states in which we operate continue to deteriorate  we may experience reductions in existing and new business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if reimbursement payments from a state are significantly delayed  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
losses of accounts or deterioration in margins in any one of the states in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
see a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in july  we were notified by the department of defense that we were not selected to by the managed care support contractor under the new t north region contract 
our protest of this decision was upheld by the gao  and the department of defense will undertake a re evaluation of the bids as a result of the protest decision 
at this time  we are unable to determine whether the re evaluation will have any effect upon the ultimate outcome of the contract award 
see item business segment information government contracts segment tricare for the details regarding the status of the t north region contract award 
if our tricare north operations are concluded  the regional concentration of our remaining business will increase significantly  further increasing our exposure to a deterioration in our financial results if our operations in these states experience significant losses 
our inability to estimate and maintain appropriate levels of reserves for claims may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our reserves for claims are estimates of incurred costs based on various assumptions 
the accuracy of these estimates may be affected by external forces such as changes in the rate of inflation  the regulatory environment  the judicious administration of claims  medical costs and other factors 
included in the reserves for claims are estimates for the costs of services that have been incurred but not reported and for claims received but not processed 
these estimates are continually monitored and reviewed and  as settlements are made or estimates adjusted  differences are reflected in current operations 
given the uncertainties inherent in such estimates  the actual liability could differ significantly from the amounts reserved 
if our actual liability is lower than estimated  
table of contents it could mean that we set premium prices too high  which could result in a loss of membership 
if our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated  it could have a negative impact on our profitability per enrolled member and  subsequently  our earnings per share in any particular quarter or annual period 
our businesses are subject to significant government regulation  which increases our cost of doing business and could adversely affect our ability to grow our businesses 
our businesses are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations  including  but not limited to  financial requirements  licensing requirements  enrollment requirements and periodic examinations by governmental agencies 
these laws and regulations are generally intended to benefit and protect providers and health plan members rather than stockholders of managed health care companies such as health net 
the laws and rules governing our business and interpretations of those laws and rules are subject to frequent change 
broad latitude is given to the agencies administering these regulations to interpret them and to impose substantial fines when they believe violations have occurred 
regulatory agencies have imposed substantial fines against us in the past  and may impose substantial fines against us in the future if they determine that we have not complied with applicable laws and regulations 
existing or future laws and rules could force us to change how we do business and may restrict our revenue and or enrollment growth  and or increase our health care and administrative costs  and or increase our exposure to liability with respect to members  providers or others 
see potential health care reform legislation being considered by congress may adversely affect us and changes to federal and state legislation and regulations affecting the managed health care industry could adversely affect us 
further  individual associates may violate these laws and rules  notwithstanding our internal policies and compliance programs 
see if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected 
our hmo and insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations relating to cash reserves  minimum net worth  premium rates  approval of policy language and benefits  appeals and grievances with respect to benefit determinations  provider contracting  utilization management  issuance and termination of policies  claims payment practices and a wide variety of other regulations relating to the development and operation of health plans 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses  or that regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statutory capital requirements for additional information 
as a government contractor  we are subject to us government oversight 
the government may ask about and investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
depending on the results of those audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us 
under government procurement regulations and practices  a negative determination resulting from such claims could result in a contractor being fined  debarred and or suspended from being able to bid on  or be awarded  new government contracts for a period of time 
in addition  we are subject to state and federal false claims laws that generally prohibit the submission of false claims for reimbursement or payment to government agencies 
courts have imposed substantial fines and penalties against companies found to have violated these laws 
we are also exposed to other risks associated with us government contracting  including dependence upon congressional appropriation and allotment of funds 
in addition  delays in obtaining  or failure to obtain or maintain  governmental approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk 
medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business  accounting for approximately of our total premium revenue in our west operations reportable segment in and an expected in over 
table of contents the last several years  we have significantly expanded our medicare health plans and restructured our medicare program management team and operations to enhance our ability to pursue business opportunities presented by the mma and the medicare program generally 
the current administration has made it clear that the reduction of medicare expenditures is an important part of health reform 
if the cost and complexity of any changes to the medicare program exceed our expectations or prevent effective program implementation  if the government alters or further reduces funding of medicare programs  if we fail to design and maintain programs that are attractive to medicare participants  if cms suspends our ability to market  or enroll members in  our medicare products  or if we are not successful in winning contract renewals or new contracts under the mma s competitive bidding process  our current medicare business and our ability to expand our medicare operations could be materially and adversely affected  and we may not be able to realize any return on our investments in medicare initiatives 
see federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations for information on our recent cms audit and details on the recent suspension of our auto enrollment for lis beneficiaries 
there are specific risks associated with our provision of medicare part d prescription drug benefits under the mma 
these risks include potential uncollectibility of receivables  inadequacy of pricing assumptions  inability to receive and process information and increased pharmaceutical costs  as well as the underlying seasonality of this business  and extended settlement periods for claims submissions 
in addition  in connection with our participation in the medicare advantage and part d programs  we regularly record revenues associated with the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms 
this mechanism is designed to appropriately reimburse health plans for the relative health care cost risk of its medicare enrollees 
because the recorded revenue is based on our best estimate at the time  the actual payment we receive from cms for risk adjustment reimbursement settlements may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
a significant reduction in revenues from the government programs in which we participate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
approximately of our total revenues relate to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  such as medicare  medicaid and tricare 
all of the revenues in our government contracts segment come from the federal government 
under government funded health programs  the government payor typically determines premium and reimbursement levels 
if the government payor reduces premium or reimbursement levels or increases them by less than our costs increase  and we are unable to make offsetting adjustments through supplemental premiums and changes in benefit plans  we could be adversely affected 
the amount of government receivables set forth in our consolidated financial statements represents our best estimate of the government s liability to us under tricare and other federal government contracts 
in general  government receivables are estimates and subject to government audit and negotiation 
in addition  inherent in government contracts are an uncertainty of and vulnerability to disagreements with the government 
final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be significantly greater or less than the amounts we initially recognize on our financial statements 
contracts under our government programs are generally subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible  reduce the revenue received by us or increase our administrative or health care costs under such programs 
changes of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes to government health care coverage programs in the future may also affect our willingness to participate in these programs 
after the northeast sale  our medicaid operations are solely in the state of california 
california is currently experiencing an unprecedented budget deficit  and the governor of california has proposed significant spending cuts for services as part of the and budget  some of which could result in reductions in enrollment in 
table of contents or reimbursement from the medi cal and healthy families programs 
any enrollment freeze or additional significant reduction in payments received in connection with medi cal  the healthy families program or similar programs could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  particularly as our medi cal membership increases due to current economic conditions 
in addition  california could impose requirements on the medi cal program that make continued operations not feasible 
health care operations under our tricare north contract are scheduled to conclude on march   unless extended by the department of defense 
we have been formally notified by the department of defense that it intends to exercise two additional option periods under our current north region contract which  if both were exercised  would extend our existing tricare contract through march  we were not selected to be the managed care support contractor under the t contract for the north region and protested that decision 
see item business segment information government contracts segment tricare for additional information regarding the t contract for the north region 
the filing of our protest triggered an automatic suspension of the performance of the t north contract which had the effect of stalling the transition implementation of the t north contract 
the department of defense has indicated that if transition work is resumed  the contractor will be given a ten month transition period prior to the start of health care delivery under the contract 
there can be no assurance that the department of defense will exercise both option periods under our current tricare contract or that it will not shorten the transition period to the new contract to less than ten months 
if the additional option periods under the current contract are not exercised or the transition period under the new contract is shortened  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are not awarded the t north contract following the re evaluation of the bids  we may be forced to wind down our tricare operations after our existing contract concludes 
the winding down process could result in the need to incur a significant impairment charge due to severance and other costs incurred to terminate the operations that are in excess of transition out payments received from the department of defense 
the loss of the tricare business could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
federal and state audits  review and investigations of us and our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we have been and  in some cases  currently are  involved in various federal and state governmental audits  reviews and investigations 
these include routine  regular and special investigations  audits and reviews by cms  state insurance and health and welfare departments and others pertaining to financial performance  market conduct and regulatory compliance issues 
from time to time  cms audits the risk adjustment scores that we apply to our medicare members 
for additional detail on the risk adjustment reimbursement mechanism employed by cms and risks associated with our medicare business  see note to our consolidated financial statements and medicare programs represent a significant portion of our business and are subject to risk 
such audits  reviews and investigations could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in certain programs  or the imposition of civil or criminal fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
we have entered into consent agreements relating to  and in some instances have agreed to pay fines in connection with  several recent audits and investigations 
in addition  state attorneys general have become increasingly active in investigating the activities of health plans  and we have received in the past  and may continue to receive in the future  subpoenas and other requests for information as part of these investigations 
many regulatory audits  reviews and investigations in recent years have focused on the timeliness and accuracy of claims payments by managed care companies and health insurers 
our subsidiaries have been the subject of audits  reviews and investigations of this nature 
depending on the circumstances and the specific matters reviewed  regulatory findings could require remediation of claims payment errors and payment of penalties of material amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents beginning in november  cms performed a routine audit of certain of our medicare advantage  private fee for service and pdp products and found deficiencies in many of the business areas included in the review 
on august   cms accepted our corrective action plan relating to the audit 
in december  cms performed a focused audit to assess our implementation of the corrective action plan 
we received cms report on the focused audit and related corrective action request on january  and submitted our corrective action plan to cms for review and approval on february  cms found deficiencies in many of the business areas included in the review  including several repeat findings from previous audits  which were submitted to cms central office for review 
if the cms central office believes that the repeat deficiencies are substantial  it could levy enforcement actions against us  including financial penalties and or the suspension of marketing and enrollment into our medicare products 
additionally  on january   we were notified by cms that  due to certain pharmacy claims processing errors  none of our stand alone pdp plans would be considered available for the purposes of the process through which cms randomly assigns low income subsidy lis eligible medicare beneficiaries not otherwise enrolled in pdp plans into stand alone pdp plans  effective february  in its notice to us  cms indicated that it would work with us to develop a corrective action plan in this regard  but we have not received a corrective action request from cms 
at this time  we do not expect the suspension of our auto enrollment for lis beneficiaries to have a material adverse effect on our medicare business  however  if cms were to impose substantial financial penalties and or suspend the marketing of and enrollment into our other medicare products for a significant period of time in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on our medicare business 
in addition  from time to time  agencies of the us government investigate whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with regulations applicable to government contractors 
government investigations of us  whether relating to government contracts or conducted for other reasons  could result in administrative  civil or criminal liabilities  including repayments  fines and or penalties being imposed upon us  or could lead to suspension or debarment from future us government contracting  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  we incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if we fail to accurately project litigation expenses 
we are currently  and may become in the future  subject to a variety of legal actions to which any corporation may be subject  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  fraud and misrepresentation claims  shareholder suits  including suits for securities fraud  and intellectual property and real estate related disputes 
in addition  we incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims related to the insurance industry in general and our business in particular  such as claims by members alleging failure to pay for or provide health care  poor outcomes for care delivered or arranged  improper rescission  termination or non renewal of coverage  insufficient payments for out of network services and claims relating to information security breaches  claims by employer groups for return of premiums  and claims by providers  including claims for withheld or otherwise insufficient compensation or reimbursement  claims related to self funded business and claims related to reinsurance matters 
such actions can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  and unfair or improper business practices and can include claims for punitive damages 
also  there are currently  and may be in the future  attempts to bring class action lawsuits against various managed care organizations  including us 
in some of the cases pending against us  substantial non economic or punitive damages are also being sought 
additionally  in periods prior to and subsequent to acquisitions  divestitures and other significant transactions  there may be attempts to bring lawsuits or other actions to block or unwind these transactions 
for instance  on january   the connecticut state medical society  together with two member physicians in their individual capacities  filed an appeal in the superior court in new britain  connecticut seeking to overturn the connecticut department of insurance s approval of the northeast sale 

table of contents recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of the types of claims we face 
there is a risk that we could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions we defend in excess of amounts budgeted for defense 
plaintiffs attorneys have increasingly used expansive electronic discovery requests as a litigation tactic 
responding to these requests  the scope of which may exceed the normal capacity of our historical systems for archiving and organizing electronic documents  may require application of significant resources and impose significant costs on us 
in certain cases  we could also be subject to awards of substantial legal fees and costs to plaintiffs counsel 
we cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty  and we are incurring material expenses in the defense of litigation matters  including without limitation  substantial discovery costs 
while we currently have insurance policies that may provide coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation matters  there can be no assurance that coverage will be available for any particular case or liability 
insurers could dispute coverage or the amount of insurance could not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded or settlement amounts 
in addition  certain liabilities such as punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance 
insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level that would result in us effectively self insuring cases against us 
the deductible on our errors and omissions e o insurance has reached such a level 
given the amount of the deductible  the only cases which would be covered by our e o insurance are those involving claims that substantially exceed our average claim values and otherwise qualify for coverage under the terms of the insurance policy 
we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described in note to our consolidated financial statements  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any such settlement could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in an earnings charge in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement 
although we have recorded litigation reserves which represent our best estimate on probable losses  both known and incurred but not reported  our recorded reserves might prove to be inadequate to cover an adverse result or settlement for extraordinary matters  such as the matters described in note therefore  costs associated with the various litigation matters to which we are subject and any earnings charge recorded in connection with a settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to manage our general and administrative expenses  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be harmed 
the level of our administrative expenses can affect our profitability  and our ability to manage administrative expense increases is difficult to predict 
while we attempt to effectively manage such expenses  including through the development of online functionalities and other projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  increases in staff related and other administrative expenses may occur from time to time 
these increases could be caused by any number of things  including difficulties or delays in projects designed to create administrative efficiencies  reliance on outsourced services  acquisitions and divestitures  business or product start ups or expansions  changes in business or regulatory requirements  including compliance with hipaa regulations  or other reasons 
in november  we announced a reorganization plan to enhance efficiency and achieve general and administrative cost savings 
the reorganization is nearly complete and is intended to enable us to streamline our operations  including combining duplicative administrative and operational functions and outsourcing certain operations where appropriate 
however  there can be no assurance that the reorganization will produce the anticipated savings 
under the united administrative services agreements  hnne has agreed to provide certain administrative services to the acquired companies until all of their members have either transitioned to legacy united products or non renewed 
as these operations wind down  we will seek to reduce the scale of  and ultimately eliminate  certain of our administrative functions 
in addition  we will need to reduce the scale of our overhead to reflect the smaller size of the remaining company 
in the event that the costs of the wind down are greater than we 
table of contents anticipated  our profitability could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurances that these efforts will not significantly disrupt our operations  thereby negatively impacting our financial performance 
furthermore  our failure to successfully adjust our overhead and administrative expenses in proportion to the wind down could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to managing administrative expenses  our profitability is also affected by our ability to effectively and quickly respond to events that require significant reductions and changes to the allocation of our administrative expenses 
in the event that our tricare north operations are concluded  this will render redundant many of the management  administrative and operational functions previously required to maintain those operations 
see segment information government contracts segment tricare for additional detail regarding the status of the t north region award 
while we will need to significantly reduce  reallocate or eliminate these redundant administrative expenses  we cannot guarantee you that we will be successful in making these cuts and adjustments at a pace that will maintain or increase our profitability 
in addition  we would expect to incur significant restructuring charges due to severance and other costs if we terminate our tricare north operations 
failure to adjust our overhead and other administrative expenses in proportion to these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we are unable to maintain good relations with the physicians  hospitals and other providers that we contract with  our profitability could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers as a means to assure access to health care services for our members  to manage health care costs and utilization and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments or take other actions  including litigation  which could result in higher health care costs  less desirable products for customers and members  disruption to provider access for current members or to support growth  or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  certain providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations and multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions or even monopolies 
if these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market our products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
we contract with professional providers in california primarily through capitation fee arrangements 
under a capitation fee arrangement  we pay a provider group a fixed amount per member on a regular basis and the provider group accepts the risk of the frequency and cost of member utilization of professional services  and in some cases  institutional services 
provider groups that enter into capitation fee arrangements generally contract with specialists and other secondary providers  and may contract with primary care physicians  to provide services 
the inability of provider groups to properly manage costs under capitation arrangements can result in their financial instability and the termination of their relationship with us 
a provider group s financial instability or failure to pay secondary providers for services rendered could be exacerbated by the economic recession  and could lead secondary providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular capitated payments to the provider group 
depending on state law  we could be liable for such claims 
in california  for instance  the liability of our hmo subsidiaries for unpaid provider claims has not been definitively settled 
there can be no assurance that we will not be liable for unpaid provider claims 
there can also be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with secondary providers  the failure of any of which could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
moreover  with the completion of the northeast sale our dependence on capitated provider groups has increased  as percent of our west operations members were enrolled with capitated provider groups as of december  our strategy to expand commercial membership through narrow network products also places a greater emphasis on our relationships with certain capitated provider groups  as narrow network products significantly restrict covered members access to certain hospitals and physicians 
if these capitated provider groups cannot provide comprehensive services to our 
table of contents members in narrow network products or encounter financial difficulties  it could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to members and our operations 
some providers that render services to our members and insureds that have coverage for out of network services are not contracted with our plans and insurance companies 
in those cases  there is no pre established understanding between the provider and the plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider  rather  the plan s obligation is to reimburse the member based upon the terms of the member s plan 
in some states and product lines  the amount of reimbursement is defined by law or regulation  but in most instances it is established by a standard set forth in the plan that is not clearly translated into dollar terms  such as maximum allowable amount or usual  customary and reasonable 
in such instances providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with the plan or balance bill our member 
regulatory authorities in various states may also challenge the manner in which we reimburse members for services performed by non contracted providers 
as a result of litigation or regulatory activity  we may have to pay providers additional amounts or reimburse members for their out of pocket payments 
the uncertainty about our financial obligations for such services and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of our original payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  provider groups and hospitals that contract with us have in certain situations commenced litigation and or arbitration proceedings against us to recover amounts they allege to be underpayments due to them under their contracts with us 
we believe that provider groups and hospitals have become increasingly sophisticated in their review of claim payments and contractual terms in an effort to maximize their payments from us and have increased their use of outside professionals  including accounting firms and attorneys  in these efforts 
these efforts and the litigation and arbitration that result from them could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if the current unfavorable economic conditions continue or further deteriorate  it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the economic conditions in the united states continue to be challenging 
continued concerns about the systemic impact of inflation  energy costs  rising unemployment rates  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit and other capital  the us mortgage market  consumer spending and a declining real estate market have contributed to increased market volatility and relatively low expectations for the us economy 
these events could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
these market conditions expose us to a number of risks  including risks associated with the potential financial instability of our customers 
if our customer base experiences cash flow problems or other financial difficulties  it could  in turn  adversely impact membership in our plans 
for example  our customers may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  or may make changes in the mix of products purchased from us 
if our customers experience financial issues  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
further  our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business  and in order to compete effectively in our markets  we also must deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers and that are designed and priced properly and competitively 
the adverse economic conditions could also cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary  employee funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs 
a significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
in addition  a prolonged economic downturn could negatively impact the financial position of hospitals and other providers and  as a result  could adversely affect our contracted rates with such parties and increase our medical costs 
high unemployment rates and significant employment layoffs and downsizings may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs and the profitability of our operations 
for example  in  our 
table of contents commercial membership decreased by percent due  in part  to the difficult economic conditions in the regions where we do business 
if economic conditions continue to be difficult and unemployment rates continue to be high  we may experience a reduction in existing and new business  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an extended economic downturn could adversely affect state and federal budgets  resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs  including medicare  medi cal and chip 
a reduction in california s medi cal reimbursement rates could be implemented retrospectively to payments already negotiated and or received from the government and could adversely affect our revenues and financial results 
in addition  state and federal budgetary pressures could cause new or higher levels of assessments or taxes for our commercial programs  such as surcharges on select fee for service and capitated medical claims or premium taxes on insurance companies and health maintenance organizations  and could adversely affect our results of operations 
moreover  any enrollment freeze or significant delay in reimbursement payment could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
under the united administrative services agreements  we are obligated to provide administrative services in connection with the wind down and run off of the acquired business  which exposes us to operational and financial risks 
at the closing of the northeast sale  we entered into the united administrative services agreements pursuant to which our subsidiary  hnne  provides administrative services to the hmo and insurance subsidiaries formerly engaged in our northeast operations 
the scope of these administrative services include substantially all of the day to day operational functions of these entities  including i claims payment services and operations  ii medical management services  iii financial planning and analysis  iv actuarial and underwriting services  v corporate finance services  vi regulatory relations services  vii organization effectiveness human resources services  viii legal services  ix customer care operations  x information technology services  xi premium tax filing services  xii administration of governmental assessments  xiii broker commissions payment services  and xiv other administrative services 
in addition  we have agreed to administer the medicare business of the acquired companies for and potentially for only if the related medicare contract is not transferred to a non acquired company affiliate of united as of january  
if the underlying medicare contract is not transferred and we are required to continue to administer this medicare business for united  it could slow our ability to wind down the business and could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
the united administrative services agreements require hnne to perform the administrative services in accordance with specified service standards and other requirements 
subject to certain terms and conditions  if hnne fails to comply with the service standards  among other things  it will be required to pay specified penalties in accordance with the united administrative services agreements 
we could fail to comply with the service standards for various reasons  some of which are not within our control 
for example  the personnel needed to provide the administrative services could terminate their employment with us 
the amount of penalties we could incur for violating the service standards could be substantial 
if hnne is unable to perform all or a material part of the services required under the united administrative services agreements  and is unable to obtain an alternative means to provide such services  or if hnne materially breaches the united administrative services agreements  the service recipients may terminate the united administrative services agreements 
if such a termination occurs prior to the second anniversary of the closing date of the transaction  we and hnne will be required to establish and will be required to pay to united a loss reserve  which  depending on when the united administrative services agreements are terminated  could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
see under the agreements that govern the northeast sale  we have retained responsibility for certain liabilities of the acquired business  which could be substantial  for additional detail on when the loss 
table of contents reserve is required to be established and paid 
for additional information on the united administrative services agreements  see item business segment information northeast operations 
under the agreements that govern the northeast sale  we have retained responsibility for certain liabilities of the acquired business  which could be substantial 
under the stock purchase agreement  we are required to indemnify the buyer and its affiliates for all pre closing liabilities of the acquired business and for a broad range of excluded liabilities  including liabilities arising out of the acquired business incurred through the winding up and running out period of the acquired business 
these liabilities could exceed the amount of profits that will be payable to us by the buyer in connection with the operations of the acquired business 
the stock purchase agreement does not limit the amount or duration of our obligations to the buyer and its affiliates with respect to these indemnities 
as a result  in the event that the amount of these liabilities was to exceed our expectations  we could be responsible to the buyer and its affiliates for substantial indemnification obligations 
in addition  under the stock purchase agreement  the purchase price for the acquired hmo and insurance subsidiaries is subject to adjustment upward or downward by the amount of profits or losses  subject to specified adjustments  of these subsidiaries for the period beginning on the closing date and ending on the earlier of i the second anniversary of the closing date the transition date and ii the date that all of the united administrative service agreements are terminated the asa termination date 
as a result  even though we do not own these subsidiaries  to the extent that they incur losses  we and hnne generally will be financially responsible to the buyer for the amount of such losses 
subject to certain terms and conditions  the buyer will be permitted to exercise control rights over the subsidiaries after the closing without our or hnne s consent 
the exercise of such rights by the buyer  or other events or circumstances beyond our or hnne s control  could result in substantial losses for which hnne will responsible to buyer 
furthermore  in the event that the asa termination date occurs prior to the transition date  among other things  in specified circumstances we and hnne will be required to establish and will be required to pay to buyer a loss reserve in an amount equal to an actuarially determined provision for medical costs and loss adjustment expenses as of the asa termination date for all claims of the subsidiaries through the winding up and running out period of the acquired business excluding certain unreserved claims 
depending on when the asa termination date occurs  the amount of such loss reserve could be substantial 
as a result of the provisions described above  we continue to have significant potential financial obligations to the buyer and its affiliates with respect to the acquired business 
in the event that the amount of these financial obligations exceed our expectations  our responsibilities to the buyer and its affiliates with respect to these obligations could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have a material amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness  or need to refinance existing indebtedness  in the future  which may adversely affect our operations 
our indebtedness includes million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million in borrowings under a financing facility which will amortize over a period ending december for a description of our senior notes and our financing facility  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital structure 
in addition  to provide liquidity  we have a million five year revolving credit facility that expires in june as of december   million was outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we may incur additional debt in the future 
our existing indebtedness  and any additional debt we incur in the future through drawings on our revolving credit facility or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt  which would reduce funds available to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general operating requirements  
table of contents increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt 
we continually evaluate options to refinance our outstanding indebtedness 
our ability to obtain any financing  whether through the issuance of new debt securities or otherwise  and the terms of any such financing are dependent on  among other things  our financial condition  financial market conditions within our industry and generally  credit ratings and numerous other factors 
recently  credit markets have experienced unusual uncertainty  and liquidity and access to capital markets have tightened 
see adverse conditions in the credit markets may materially affect our ability to obtain credit 
consequently  in the event we need to access the credit markets to refinance our debt  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on terms and within a time acceptable to us it could  in addition to other negative effects  have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  ability to compete or ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
concern about the stability of the markets generally has lead many lenders to reduce and in some cases cease to provide funding to borrowers 
if markets remain tight  they may materially and adversely affect our ability to access additional capital to meet liquidity needs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the current economic environment and uncertainty in the financial markets could have an adverse impact on the value of our investment portfolio and our goodwill which could  in turn  have a negative effect on our results of operations and stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of available for sale investment securities such as interest yielding debt securities of varying maturities 
as of december   our available for sale investment securities were billion 
the value of fixed income securities is highly sensitive to fluctuations in short and long term interest rates  with the value decreasing as such rates increase and increasing as such rates decrease 
these securities may also be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
we closely monitor the fair values of our investment securities and regularly evaluate them for any other than temporary impairments 
we have the intent and ability to hold our investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amount invested 
the current economic environment and uncertainty in the us and global capital markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments  such as our debt securities  and a worsening in these markets could have additional negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
in addition  such uncertainty has increased the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets 
over time  the economic and capital market environment may further deteriorate or provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities  which could change our judgment regarding the impairment of certain investments 
this could result in realized losses relating to other than temporary declines being charged against future income 
given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved  there is continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and material other than temporary impairments may result in realized losses in future periods  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our investment portfolio 
in addition  our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to state laws and regulations that govern the types of investments that are allowable and admissible in those subsidiaries portfolios 
there can be no assurance that 
table of contents our investment assets will produce total positive returns or that we will not sell investments at prices that are less than the carrying value of these investments 
changes in the value of our investment assets  as a result of interest rate fluctuations  illiquidity or otherwise  could have a negative affect on our stockholders equity 
in addition  if it became necessary for us to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
the economic environment and crisis in the financial markets that began in continued to impact our market capitalization during our annual goodwill impairment test did not indicate any impairment in as a result of the fluctuations in our market capitalization 
however  if our stock price experiences significant fluctuations or if our market capitalization materially declines  we could be required to update our goodwill impairment test prior to our regularly scheduled annual test in depending on the results of any such impairment test  we could be required to take an impairment charge to reduce the carrying amount of our goodwill 
if we were required to take such a charge  it would be non cash and would not affect our liquidity  tangible equity or regulatory capital levels but could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations 
downgrades in our debt ratings may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims paying ability  financial strength  and debt ratings by nationally recognized rating agencies are increasingly important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and health benefits companies 
ratings information by nationally recognized rating agencies is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
we believe our claims paying ability and financial strength ratings are important factors in marketing our products to certain of our customers 
in addition  our debt ratings impact both the cost and availability of future borrowings and  accordingly  our cost of capital

each of the rating agencies reviews our ratings periodically and there can be no assurance that current ratings will be maintained in the future 
our ratings reflect each rating agency s independent opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  ability to meet our debt obligations or obligations to policyholders and other factors 
potential further downgrades from ratings agencies  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are a holding company and a substantial amount of our cash flow is generated by our subsidiaries 
our regulated subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the payment of dividends and maintenance of minimum levels of capital 
as a holding company  our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our consolidated operations and own substantially all of our consolidated assets 
consequently  our cash flow and our ability to pay our debt depends  in part  on the amount of cash that we receive from our subsidiaries 
our subsidiaries ability to make any payments to us will depend on their earnings  business and tax considerations  legal and regulatory restrictions and economic conditions 
in addition  in certain states our regulated subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital 
table of contents requirements  known as rbc 
these laws require our regulated subsidiaries to report their results of risk based capital calculations to the departments of insurance in their state of domicile and the national association of insurance commissioners 
failure to maintain the minimum rbc standards could subject certain of our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action  including increased reporting and or state supervision 
in addition  in most states  we are required to seek prior approval before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts 
if our regulated subsidiaries are restricted from paying us dividends or otherwise making cash transfers to us  it could have material adverse effect on our results of operations and health net  inc s free cash flow

our revolving credit facility and our financing facility require us to comply with various covenants that impose restrictions on our operations  including our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends  make investments or other restricted payments  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in other activities 
our revolving credit facility and our financing facility also require us to comply with certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio

the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facility and our financing facility could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies

potential further downgrades from ratings agencies  should they occur  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the markets in which we do business are highly competitive 
if we do not design and price our product offerings competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
many of our competitors may have certain characteristics  capabilities or resources  such as greater market share  superior provider and supplier arrangements and existing business relationships  that give them an advantage in competing with us 
these competitors include hmos  ppos  self funded employers  insurance companies  hospitals  health care facilities and other health care providers 
in addition  other companies may enter our markets in the future 
in addition  financial services or other technology based companies could enter the market and compete with us on the basis of their streamlined administrative functions 
the addition of new competitors can occur relatively easily and customers enjoy significant flexibility in moving between competitors 
there is a risk that our customers may decide to perform for themselves functions or services currently provided by us  which could result in a decrease in our revenues 
in addition  our providers and suppliers may decide to market products and services to our customers in competition with us 
in recent years  there has been significant merger and acquisition activity in our industry and in industries that act as our suppliers  such as the hospital  medical group  pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
this activity may create stronger competitors and or result in higher health care costs 
in addition  our contracts with government agencies  such as our tricare north contract  are frequently up for re bid and the loss of any significant government contract to a competitor  such as the t north region contract  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that there is strong competition or that competition intensifies in any market  our ability to retain or increase customers  our revenue growth  our pricing flexibility  our control over medical cost trends and our marketing expenses may all be adversely affected 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if we do not design and price our products appropriately and competitively  if we are unable to innovate and deliver products and services that demonstrate value to our customers  if we set rates too high or too low in highly competitive markets  if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products  if we do not provide satisfactory service levels  if membership or demand for other services does not increase as we expect or if membership or demand for other services declines  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
at the closing of the northeast sale  we entered into a non competition agreement with the buyer that contains prohibitions which could negatively impact our prospects  business  financial condition or results of operations 
under the stock purchase agreement  at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the agreement  we entered into a non competition agreement with the buyer  pursuant to which we generally are prohibited from competing with the acquired business in the states of new york  new jersey  connecticut and rhode island for a period of five years  and from engaging in certain other restricted activities 
although we currently do not have any intention to engage in such prohibited activities during the term of the non competition agreement  circumstances could change and it may become in our best interests to engage in a business that is prohibited by the agreement 
if this were to occur  in order to engage in the business we would be required to obtain the 
table of contents buyer s consent under the non competition agreement  which the buyer could withhold in its discretion 
in the event that we are unable to engage in a business due to the terms of the non competition agreement  this could have an adverse effect on our prospects  business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we fail to effectively maintain our information management systems  it could adversely affect our business 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems 
the information gathered and processed by our information management systems assists us in  among other things  pricing our services  monitoring utilization and other cost factors  processing provider claims  billing our customers on a timely basis and identifying accounts for collection 
our customers and providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verification  claims status and other information 
we have many different information systems for our various businesses and these systems require continual maintenance  upgrading and enhancement to meet our operational needs 
our merger  acquisition and divestiture activity also requires transitions to or from  and the integration of  various information management systems 
any difficulty or unexpected delay associated with the transition to or from information systems  including the current transition of our data center operations to a third party vendor  any inability or failure to properly maintain information management systems  or any inability or failure to successfully update or expand processing capability or develop new capabilities to meet our business needs  could result in operational disruptions  loss of existing customers  difficulty in attracting new customers  disputes with customers and providers  regulatory problems  significant increases in administrative expenses and or other adverse consequences 
in addition  we may  from time to time  obtain significant portions of our systems related or other services or facilities from independent third parties  which may make our operations vulnerable to adverse effects if such third parties fail to perform adequately 
see we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
we are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties 
we contract with independent third party vendors who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions 
these third party vendors include  but are not limited to  information technology system providers  medical management providers  claims administration providers  billing and enrollment providers  third party service providers of actuarial services  call center providers and specialty service providers 
our arrangements with third party vendors may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us  including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data 
our outsourcing arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in the vendors operations or financial condition or other matters outside of our control 
if we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors  we could be subject to additional risk 
violations of laws or regulations governing our business by third party vendors could increase our exposure to liability or otherwise increase the costs associated with the operation of our business 
in addition  to the extent we outsource selected services or selected functions to third parties in foreign jurisdictions  we could be exposed to risks inherent in conducting business outside of the united states  including international economic and political conditions  additional costs associated with complying with foreign laws and fluctuations in currency values 
moreover  if these vendor relationships were terminated for any reason  we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms  and may incur significant costs in connection with any such vendor transition 
as a result  we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and  in turn  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be harmed 
in addition  we may not fully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors  as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing  unanticipated delays in transitioning our operations to the third party vendor or otherwise 
this could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact our results of operations 

table of contents acquisitions  divestitures and other significant transactions may adversely affect our business 
we continue to evaluate the profitability realized or likely to be realized by our existing businesses and operations 
from time to time we review  from a strategic standpoint  potential acquisitions and divestitures in light of our core businesses and growth strategies 
the success of any such acquisition or divestiture depends  in part  upon our ability to identify suitable buyers or sellers  negotiate favorable contractual terms and  in many cases  obtain governmental approval 
for acquisitions  success is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business into the company s existing operations 
in the event the structure of the transaction results in continuing obligations by the buyer to us or our customers  a buyer s inability to fulfill these obligations could lead to future financial loss on our part 
potential acquisitions or divestitures present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including diversion of management attention from existing businesses  difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems  significant post closing obligations  increased expenses  assumption of unknown liabilities  indemnities and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers 
we completed the sale of our northeast operations on december  risks associated with that divestiture are described in under the united administrative services agreements  we are obligated to provide administrative services in connection with the wind down and run off of the acquired business  which exposes us to operational and financial risks and under the agreements that govern the northeast sale  we have retained responsibility for certain liabilities of the acquired business  which could be substantial 
further  in the event the structure of the transaction results in continuing obligations by the buyer to us or our customers  a buyer s inability to fulfill these obligations could lead to future financial loss on our part 
the value of our intangible assets may become impaired 
goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately million as of december   representing approximately percent of our total assets and percent of our consolidated stockholders equity at december  in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets to determine whether all or a portion of their carrying values may be impaired  in which case a charge to income may be necessary 
this impairment testing requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding estimated fair value including assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and membership levels based on current and future plans and initiatives  long term strategies and our annual planning and forecasting processes  as well as the expected weighted average cost of capital used in the discount process 
if estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests  or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization  we may be required to record impairment losses against income 
any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially impact our results of operations and shareholders equity in the period in which the impairment occurs 
a material decrease in shareholders equity could  in turn  negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants 
from time to time  we divest businesses that are less of a strategic fit for the company or do not produce an adequate return 
any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment charges  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we completed the northeast sale on december  in connection with the northeast sale  we assessed the recoverability of goodwill and our long lived assets  including other intangible assets  property and equipment and other long term assets related to our northeast operations reporting segment during the quarter ended september  as a result  in the quarter ended september  we recorded million in total asset impairments  including goodwill impairment of million  impairments of other intangible assets of million and property and equipment of million 
during this period we also 
table of contents recorded an additional million of asset impairment on the long lived assets related to our northeast operations 
upon the consummation of the northeast sale on december   we recorded a pretax loss on sale of million 
while these non cash impairment charges and pretax loss had no impact on our liquidity position  they did have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations for the year ended december  we must comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure compliance by our business associates with hipaa 
in december  the department of health and human services promulgated regulations under hipaa related to the privacy and security of electronically transmitted protected health information phi 
the regulations require health plans  clearinghouses and providers to comply with various requirements and restrictions related to the use  storage  transmission and disclosure of phi  adopt rigorous internal procedures to safeguard phi  and enter into specific written agreements with business associates to whom phi is disclosed 
the regulations also establish significant criminal penalties and civil sanctions for non compliance 
in addition  the regulations could expose us to additional liability for  among other things  violations of the regulations by our business associates  including the third party vendors involved in our outsourcing projects 
the hitech act  which became fully effective in february  expanded the hipaa rules for security and privacy safeguards  including improved enforcement  additional limitations on use and disclosure of phi and additional potential penalties 
although our contracts with business associates provide for appropriate protections of phi  we may have limited control over the actions and practices of our business associates 
compliance with hipaa and other state and federal privacy and security regulations may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes  the development of new administrative processes and the effects of potential noncompliance by ourselves or our business associates 
see if we fail to comply with restrictions on patient privacy and information security  including taking steps to ensure that our business associates who obtain access to sensitive patient information maintain its confidentiality  our reputation and business operations could be materially adversely affected for detail regarding our recent information security breach

despite the security measures we have in place to ensure compliance with applicable laws and rules  our facilities and systems  and those of our third party service providers  may be vulnerable to security breaches  acts of vandalism or theft  computer viruses  misplaced or lost data  programming and or human errors or other similar events 
for example  a portable  external hard drive holding phi of certain of our enrollees  such as social security numbers and medical data  was discovered missing from our northeast headquarters in shelton  connecticut in may while the information stored on the hard drive was saved in an image format that cannot be read without special software  we subsequently commenced a lengthy investigation of the contents of the hard drive  including a detailed forensic review by computer experts  reported the loss to authorities and began notifying our customers of the incident 
on january   the connecticut attorney general filed a complaint in federal court in connecticut alleging that we had violated hipaa and the connecticut unfair trade practices act in connection with the loss of the disk drive 
the complaint seeks injunctive relief as well as statutory damages  attorney fees and litigation costs 
noncompliance with any privacy laws or any security breach involving the misappropriation  loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential member information  whether by us or by one of our business associates  could have a material adverse effect on our business  reputation and results of operations  including but not limited to material fines and penalties  compensatory  special  punitive  and statutory damages  litigation  consent orders regarding our privacy and security practices  adverse actions against our licenses to do business  and injunctive relief 
additionally  the costs incurred to remediate any data security incident could be

we depend  in part  on independent brokers and sales agents to market our products and services  and recent regulatory investigations have focused on certain brokerage practices  including broker compensation arrangements and bid quoting practices 
we market our products and services both through sales people employed by us and through independent sales agents 
independent sales agents typically do not work with us on an exclusive basis and may market health care products and services of our competitors 
we face intense competition for the services and allegiance of independent sales agents and we cannot assure you that these agents will continue to market our products at a reasonable cost 
although we have a number of sales employees and agents  if key sales employees or agents or a large subset of these individuals were to leave us  our ability to retain existing customers and members could be impaired 
there have been a number of investigations and enforcement actions against insurance brokers and insurers over the last several years regarding allegedly inappropriate or undisclosed payments made by insurers to brokers for the placement of insurance business 
for example  cms has increased its scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurers regarding allegedly improper sales and marketing practices in connection with the sale of medicare products 
while we are not aware of any unlawful practices by the company or any of our agents or brokers in connection with the marketing and sales of our products and services  investigations by state attorneys general  cms and other regulators  as well as regulatory changes initiated in several states in response to allegedly inappropriate broker conduct and broker payment practices  could result in changes in industry practices that could have an adverse effect on our ability to market our products 
we have historically experienced significant turnover in senior management 
if we are unable to manage the succession of our key executives  it could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced a high turnover in our senior management team in recent years 
although we have succession plans in place and have employment arrangements with our key executives  these do not guarantee that the services of these key executives will continue to be available to us 
we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for future turnover of our senior management team

these assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties  and  as a matter of course  any number of them may prove to be incorrect 
the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors  including those described in this annual report  many of which are beyond our control

there can be no assurances regarding the level or stability of our share price at any time or the impact of these or any other factors on our stock price 
negative publicity regarding the managed health care industry could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and services 
managed health care companies have received and continue to receive negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
for example  the company and the managed health care industry have been subject to negative publicity surrounding practices in connection with the rescission of individual health insurance policies 
in addition  health care and related health care reform proposals have been and are expected to continue to be the subject of intense media attention and political debate 
such political discourse can often generate publicity that portrays managed care in a negative light 
our marketing efforts may be affected by the amount of negative publicity to which the industry has been subject  as well as by speculation and uncertainty relating to merger and acquisition activity among companies in our industry 
speculation  uncertainty or negative publicity about us  our industry or our lines of business could adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products or services  require changes to our products or services  or stimulate additional legislation  regulation  review of industry practices or litigation that could adversely affect us 
large scale public health epidemics and or terrorist activity could cause us to incur unexpected health care and other costs and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
an outbreak of a pandemic disease and or future terrorist activities  including bio terrorism  could materially and adversely affect the us economy in general and the health care industry specifically 
depending on the government s actions and the responsiveness of public health agencies and insurance companies  a large scale public health epidemic or future acts of bio terrorism could lead to  among other things  increased use of health care services  disruption of information and payment systems  increased health care costs due to increased in patient and out patient hospital costs and the cost of any anti viral medication used to treat affected people 
natural disasters  including earthquakes  fires and floods  could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations and result in an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
natural disasters such as fire  flood  earthquake  tornado  power loss  virus  telecommunications failure  break in or similar event could severely damage or interrupt our systems and operations  result in loss of data  and or delay or impair our ability to service our members and providers 
we have in place a disaster recovery plan which is intended to provide us with the ability to maintain fully redundant systems for our operations in the event of a natural disaster utilizing various alternate sites provided by a national disaster recovery vendor 
however  there can be no assurance that such adverse effects will not occur in the event of a disaster 
any such

item legal proceedings 
litigation related to the sale of businesses amcareco litigation we are a defendant in two related litigation matters pending in louisiana and texas state courts  both of which relate to claims asserted by three separate state receivers overseeing the liquidation of three health plans in louisiana  texas and oklahoma that were previously owned by our former subsidiary  foundation health corporation fhc  which merged into health net  inc in january in  fhc sold its interest in these plans to amcareco  inc amcareco 
we retained a minority interest in the three plans after the sale 
thereafter  the three plans became known as amcare of louisiana amcare la  amcare of oklahoma amcare ok and amcare of texas amcare tx 
in  three years after the sale of the plans to amcareco  each of the amcare plans was placed under state oversight and ultimately into receivership 
the receivers for each of the 
table of contents amcare plans filed suit against us contending that  among other things  we were responsible as a controlling shareholder of amcareco following the sale of the plans for post acquisition misconduct by amcareco and others that caused the three health plans to fail and ultimately be placed into receivership 
on june   a consolidated trial of the claims asserted against us by the three receivers commenced in state court in baton rouge  louisiana 
the claims of the receiver for amcare tx were tried before a jury and the claims of the receivers for the amcare la and amcare ok were tried before the judge in the same proceeding 
on june   the jury considering the claims of the receiver for amcare tx returned a verdict against us in the amount of million  consisting of million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages 
the court later reduced the compensatory and punitive damages awards to million and million  respectively  and entered judgments against us in those amounts 
the proceedings regarding the claims of the receivers for amcare la and amcare ok concluded on july  on november   the court issued separate judgments on those claims and awarded million in compensatory damages to amcare la and million in compensatory damages to amcare ok  respectively 
the court later denied requests by amcare la and amcare ok for attorneys fees and punitive damages 
we thereafter appealed both judgments  and the receivers for amcare la and amcare ok each appealed the orders denying them attorneys fees and punitive damages 
on december   the court of appeal issued its judgment on each of the appeals 
it reversed in their entirety the trial court s judgments in favor of the amcare tx and amcare ok receivers  and entered judgment in our favor against those receivers  finding that the receivers claims failed as a matter of law 
as a result  those receivers cross appeals were rendered moot 
the court of appeal also reversed the trial court judgment in favor of the amcare la receiver  with the exception of a single breach of contract claim  on which it entered judgment in favor of the amcare la receiver in the amount of million 
on january   the three receivers filed a request for rehearing by the court of appeal 
on february   the court of appeal denied the request for a rehearing 
following the court of appeal s denial of the requests for rehearing  each of the receivers filed applications for a writ with the louisiana supreme court 
on december   the louisiana supreme court granted the receivers writs  and oral argument has been scheduled for march  in light of the original trial court judgments against us  on november   we filed a complaint in the us district court for the middle district of louisiana and simultaneously filed an identical suit in the th judicial district court in east baton rouge parish seeking to nullify the three judgments that were rendered against us on the grounds of ill practice which resulted in the judgments entered 
we have alleged that the judgments and other prejudicial rulings rendered in these cases were the result of impermissible ex part contacts between the receivers  their counsel and the trial court during the course of the litigation 
preliminary motions and exceptions have been filed by the receivers for amcare tx  amcare ok and amcare la seeking dismissal of our claim for nullification on various grounds 
the federal judge dismissed health net s federal complaint and health net appealed to the us fifth circuit court of appeals 
on july   the fifth circuit issued an opinion affirming the district court s dismissal of the federal complaint  albeit on different legal grounds from those relied upon by the district court 
the state court nullity action has been stayed pending the resolution of health net s jurisdictional appeal in the federal action and has remained stayed during the pendency of the appeal of the underlying judgments 
these proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their outcome  including the outcome of any appeal  cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations  cash flow and or liquidity could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of these proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

table of contents miscellaneous proceedings in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are also subject to periodic reviews by various regulatory agencies with respect to our compliance with a wide variety of rules and regulations applicable to our business  including  without limitation  rules relating to pre authorization penalties  payment of out of network claims and timely review of grievances and appeals  which may result in remediation of certain claims and the assessment of regulatory fines or penalties 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business operations  we are also party to various other legal proceedings  including  without limitation  litigation arising out of our general business activities  such as contract disputes  employment litigation  wage and hour claims  real estate and intellectual property claims  claims brought by members seeking coverage or additional reimbursement for services allegedly rendered to our members  but which allegedly were either denied  underpaid or not paid  and claims arising out of the acquisition or divestiture of various business units or other assets 
we are also subject to claims relating to the performance of contractual obligations to providers  members  employer groups and others  including the alleged failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the manner in which we process claims 
in addition  we are subject to claims relating to the insurance industry in general  such as claims relating to information security breaches  reinsurance agreements  rescission of coverage and other types of insurance coverage obligations 
these other regulatory and legal proceedings are subject to many uncertainties  and  given their complexity and scope  their final outcome cannot be predicted at this time 
it is possible that in a particular quarter or annual period our results of operations and cash flow could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable resolution of any or all of these other regulatory and legal proceedings depending  in part  upon the results of operations or cash flow for such period 
however  at this time  management believes that the ultimate outcome of the regulatory and legal proceedings currently pending against us  after consideration of applicable reserves and potentially available insurance coverage benefits  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity 
potential settlements we regularly evaluate litigation matters pending against us  including those described above  to determine if settlement of such matters would be in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
the costs associated with any such settlement could be substantial and  in certain cases  could result in a significant earnings charge in any particular quarter in which we enter into a settlement agreement 
we have recorded reserves and accrued costs for future legal costs for certain significant matters 
these reserves and accrued costs represent our best estimate of probable loss  including related future legal costs for such matters  both known and incurred but not reported  although our recorded amounts might ultimately be inadequate to cover such costs 
therefore  the costs associated with the various litigation matters to which we are subject and any earnings charge recorded in connection with a settlement agreement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

how we measure our profitability our profitability depends in large part on our ability to  among other things  effectively price our health care products  manage health care costs  including reserve estimates and pharmacy costs  contract with health care providers  attract and retain members  and manage our general and administrative g a and selling expenses 
in addition  factors such as regulation  competition and general economic conditions affect our operations and 
table of contents profitability 
the effect of escalating health care costs  as well as any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers  may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business  and may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we measure our west operations and northeast operations reportable segments profitability based on medical care ratio mcr and pretax income 
the mcr is calculated as health plan services expense excluding depreciation and amortization divided by health plan services premiums 
the pretax income is calculated as health plan services premiums and administrative services fees and other income less health plan services expense and g a and other net expenses 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our mcr and results of operations health plan services results for a calculation of our pretax income 
health plan services premiums include health maintenance organization hmo  point of service pos and preferred provider organization ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts  including medicare part d  to provide care to enrolled medicare recipients 
medicare revenue can also include amounts for risk factor adjustments and additional premiums that we charge in some places to members who purchase our medicare risk plans see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the amount of premiums we earn in a given year is driven by the rates we charge and enrollment levels 
administrative services fees and other income primarily include revenue for administrative services such as claims processing  customer service  medical management  provider network access and other administrative services 
health plan services expense includes medical and related costs for health services provided to our members  including physician services  hospital and related professional services  outpatient care  and pharmacy benefit costs 
these expenses are impacted by unit costs and utilization rates 
unit costs represent the health care cost per visit  and the utilization rates represent the volume of health care consumption by our members 
g a expenses include those costs related to employees and benefits  consulting and professional fees  marketing  premium taxes and assessments  occupancy costs and litigation and regulatory related costs 
such costs are driven by membership levels  introduction of new products  system consolidations  outsourcing activities and compliance requirements for changing regulations 
these expenses also include expenses associated with corporate shared services and other costs to reflect the fact that such expenses are incurred primarily to support health plan services 
selling expenses consist of external broker commission expenses and generally vary with premium volume 
we measure our government contracts segment profitability based on government contracts cost ratio and pretax income 
the government contracts cost ratio is calculated as government contracts cost divided by government contracts revenue 
the pretax income is calculated as government contracts revenue less government contracts cost 
see results of operations table of summary financial information for a calculation of our government contracts cost ratio and results of operations government contracts segment results for a calculation of our pretax income 
government contracts revenue is made up of two major components health care and administrative services 
the health care component includes revenue recorded for health care costs for the provision of services to our members  including paid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims ibnr expenses for which we are at risk  and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
the administrative services component encompasses fees received for all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contract with the government 
government contracts revenue and expenses include the impact from underruns and overruns relative to our target cost under the applicable contracts see note to our consolidated financial statements

income tax provision our income tax expense and the effective income tax rate for the years ended december   and are as follows dollars in millions income tax expense effective tax rate the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the year ended december  due primarily to state income taxes  tax exempt investment income  nondeductible goodwill impairment  and the tax benefit associated with the northeast sale 
the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the year ended december  due primarily to state income taxes  tax exempt investment income  and a favorable outcome related to prior year nondeductible class action lawsuit expenses 
the effective income tax rate differs from the statutory federal tax rate of for the year ended december  due primarily to state income taxes  tax exempt investment income  the establishment of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  and nondeductible class action lawsuit expenses 
the effective income tax rate in is an inverse ratio to the pretax loss 
we reported a tax expense associated with a pretax loss because a significant portion of the loss on sale of our northeast health plan subsidiaries and the associated goodwill impairment is nondeductible for tax reporting purposes 
the impact of these nondeductible items is the primary cause of the large change in tax rates between and the effective income tax decreased from to primarily due to the favorable outcome related to the prior year nondeductible class action lawsuit expenses 
liquidity and capital resources market and economic conditions the current state of the global economy and market conditions continue to be challenging with high levels of unemployment  diminished business and consumer confidence  and volatility in both us and international capital and credit markets 
these conditions continue to negatively impact the availability of funding to borrowers 
market conditions could limit our ability to timely replace maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  if our customer base experiences cash flow problems and other financial difficulties  it could  in turn  adversely impact membership in our plans 
for example  our customers may modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products  may reduce the number of individuals to whom they provide coverage  or may make changes in the mix or products purchased from us 
in addition  if our customers experience financial issues  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable that are owed to us 
further  our customers or potential customers may force us to compete more vigorously on factors such as price and service to retain or obtain their business 
a significant decline in membership in our plans and the inability of current and or potential customers to pay their premiums as a result of unfavorable conditions may adversely affect our business  including our revenues  profitability and cash flow

given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved  there is a continuing risk that further declines in fair value may occur and additional material other than temporary impairments may be recorded in future periods 
after performing our impairment analysis  we noted that one of our prime residential mortgage backed securities may suffer losses under certain stressed scenarios 
as a result  we recognized an impairment related to the credit loss in the amount of  during the year ended december  this amount represents the difference between the present value of the company s best estimate of future cash flows using the latest performance indicators and the amortized cost basis 
during the year ended december   we recognized a million loss from other than temporary impairments of our cash equivalents and available for sale investments 
such other than temporary impairments primarily were as a result of investments in corporate debt from lehman brothers  money market funds from the reserve and preferred stock from fannie mae and freddie mac 
in september  the reserve announced its intention to liquidate its money market fund and froze all redemptions until an orderly liquidation process could be implemented 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we reclassified million in estimated net asset value we had invested in the reserve money market funds from cash equivalents to investments available for sale 
as of december   we held million in the reserve primary institutional fund and million in the reserve us government fund 
on january   the reserve paid out in full the 
table of contents balance in the us government fund 
on january   the reserve primary fund made its sixth distribution  and in total  we have received approximately of the million 
liquidity we believe that cash flow from operating activities  existing working capital  lines of credit and cash reserves are adequate to allow us to fund existing obligations  repurchase shares under our stock repurchase program  introduce new products and services  and continue to develop health care related businesses 
we regularly evaluate cash requirements for current operations and commitments  and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
we may elect to raise additional funds for these purposes  either through issuance of debt or equity  the sale of investment securities or otherwise  as appropriate 
based on the composition and quality of our investment portfolio  our expected ability to liquidate our investment portfolio as needed  and our expected operating and financing cash flows  we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment 
however  continued turbulence in us and international markets could adversely affect our liquidity 
our cash flow from operating activities is impacted by  among other things  the timing of collections on our amounts receivable from our tricare contract for the north region 
health care receivables related to tricare are best estimates of payments that are ultimately collectible or payable 
the timing of collection of such receivables is impacted by government audit and negotiation and can extend for periods beyond a year 
amounts receivable under government contracts were million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
our cash flow from operating activities is also impacted by the timing of collections on our amounts receivable from cms 
our receivable related to our medicare business was million as of december  and million as of december  during  we recognized million in pretax charges related to our operations strategy  reductions for a litigation reserve true up and northeast sale related expenses 
the majority of these charges was settled in cash and was funded by cash flow from operating and financing activities 
for additional information regarding these charges  see summary of operating results above

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash from operating activities decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the million paid in related to operations strategy and litigation and regulatory related matters  a million increase in our net cms catastrophic and low income subsidies receivables  and approximately million medicare part d payments received in for the final settlement of the plan year 
investing activities our cash flow from investing activities is primarily impacted by the sales  maturities and purchases of our available for sale investment securities and restricted investments 
our investment objective is to maintain safety and preservation of principal by investing in high quality  investment grade securities while maintaining liquidity in each portfolio sufficient to meet our cash flow requirements and attaining the highest total return on invested funds 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in investing activities increased by million compared to the year ended december  primarily due to million net cash used in the sale of the northeast operations including million of cash balances given up at the subsidiaries offset by million received from united  offset by a million decrease in cash used for the purchase of property and equipment and a million net increase in the sale of investments available for sale 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased by million compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the million redemption from the reserve funds  partially offset by million decrease in net proceeds from property and equipment sale

the maximum amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility is reduced by the dollar amount of any outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   we had outstanding an aggregate of million in letters of credit and outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million 
as a result  the maximum amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility was million as of december   and no amount had been drawn on the letters of credit 
as of february   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents interest rate swap contract on march   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement swap under which we pay an amount equal to times a notional principal amount and in return we receive an amount equal to libor times the same notional principal amount 
the swap is designed to reduce variability in our net income due to changes in variable interest rates 
statutory capital requirements certain of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital and surplus requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
management believes that as of december   all of our active health plans and insurance subsidiaries met their respective regulatory requirements in all material respects 
by law  regulation and governmental policy  our health plan and insurance subsidiaries  which we refer to as our regulated subsidiaries  are required to maintain minimum levels of statutory net worth 
the minimum statutory net worth requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premium revenue  a percentage of annualized health care costs  or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the national association of insurance commissioners 
the rbc formula  which calculates asset risk  underwriting risk  credit risk  business risk and other factors  generates the authorized control level acl  which represents the minimum amount of net worth believed to be required to support the regulated entity s business 
for states in which the rbc requirements have been adopted  the regulated entity typically must maintain the greater of the company action level rbc  calculated as of the acl  or the minimum statutory net worth requirement calculated pursuant to pre rbc guidelines 
because our regulated subsidiaries are also subject to their state regulators overall oversight authority  some of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum capital and surplus in excess of the rbc requirement  even though rbc has been adopted in their states of domicile 
historically  we generally managed our aggregate regulated subsidiary capital above of acl  although rbc standards are not yet applicable to all of our regulated subsidiaries 
at december   we had sufficient capital to exceed of acl  a higher level compared to the past 
as necessary  we make contributions to and issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations 
during the year ended december   we made capital contributions of million to various subsidiaries to increase rbc or other statutory capital compared to a higher level compared to the past 
the capital contributions were generally not required to meet regulatory requirements  but were made to enhance the financial condition of the subsidiaries 
health net  inc made no capital contributions to any of its subsidiaries to meet rbc or other statutory capital requirements under state laws and regulations thereafter through february  in addition  pursuant to the stock purchase agreement relating to the northeast sale  we have agreed to contribute additional capital to the acquired companies to meet statutory capital requirements as required by governmental authorities 
the amount of such contributions  if any  will be added to the payments we are entitled to receive under the stock purchase agreement 
legislation has been or may be enacted in certain states in which our subsidiaries operate imposing substantially increased minimum capital and or statutory deposit requirements for hmos in such states 
such statutory deposits may only be drawn upon under limited circumstances relating to the protection of policyholders 
as a result of the above requirements and other regulatory requirements  certain subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on their ability to make dividend payments  loans or other transfers of cash to their parent companies 
such restrictions  unless amended or waived or unless regulatory approval is granted  limit the use of any cash

the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid by our insurance company subsidiaries without prior approval of the applicable state insurance departments is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus  statutory income and unassigned surplus

long term purchase obligations and commitments we have entered into long term agreements to purchase various services  which may contain certain termination provisions and have remaining terms in excess of one year as of december  we have entered into long term agreements to receive services related to pharmacy benefit management  pharmacy claims processing services and health quality risk scoring enhancement services with external third party service providers 
the remaining terms are approximately three years for each of these contracts 
termination of these agreements is subject to certain termination provisions 
the total future minimum commitments under these agreements are million and are included in the table above

the remaining term of this contract is approximately five years  and the total estimated future commitments under the agreement are approximately million 
under the stock purchase agreement  we retain financial responsibility for the profits or losses  subject to specified adjustments  of the acquired companies for the period beginning on the closing date and ending on the earlier of i the second anniversary of the closing date and ii the date that all of the united administrative services agreements are terminated 
we expect the united administrative services agreements to be in effect for approximately two years following the closing of the transaction  and anticipate that these profits or losses and the other expenses we incur in performing the administrative services could be significant 
under the stock purchase agreement  we also will be entitled to of the profits or losses associated with the acquired companies medicare business for the year ended december  subject to a cap of million of profit or loss 
in the event that the acquired companies renew the medicare contract for the acquired business for the year ended december   united will be entitled to all of the after tax profits and losses relating to the business for that year subject to certain limitations 
we have agreed to administer the medicare business of the acquired companies for and for only if the related medicare contract is not transferred to a non acquired company affiliate of united as of january  
we expect to administer the medicaid business of the acquired companies until no later than june   which is the termination date for the related medicaid contract 
see item business segment information northeast operations segment for additional detail on the northeast sale 
we have excluded from the table above amounts already recorded in our current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  we have also excluded from the table above various contracts we have entered into with our health care providers  health care facilities  the federal government and other contracts that we have entered into for the purpose of providing health care services 
we have excluded those contracts that allow for cancellation without significant penalty  obligations that are contingent upon achieving certain goals and contracts for goods and services that are fulfilled by vendors within a short time horizon and within the normal course of business 
the future contractual obligations in the contractual obligations table are estimated based on information currently available 
the timing of and the actual payment amounts may differ based on actual events 
surety bonds in order to secure judgment pending our appeal in the amcareco litigation  we obtained surety bonds totaling million  which are further secured by letters of credit issued in december in the amounts of million

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined under regulation s k a and the instructions thereto 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
principal areas requiring the use of estimates include revenue recognition  health care costs  reserves for contingent liabilities  amounts receivable or payable under government contracts  goodwill and recoverability of long lived assets and investments and income taxes 
accordingly  we consider accounting policies on these areas to be critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
a significant change in any one of these amounts may have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies that we use in preparing our financial statements is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  which are included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
health plan services health plan services premium revenues include hmo  pos and ppo premiums from employer groups and individuals and from medicare recipients who have purchased supplemental benefit coverage for which premiums are based on a predetermined prepaid fee  medicaid revenues based on multi year contracts to provide care to medicaid recipients  and revenue under medicare risk contracts including part d to provide care and services to enrolled medicare recipients 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the related enrollees are entitled to health care services 
premiums collected in advance of the month in which enrollees are entitled to health care services are recorded as unearned premiums 
approximately   and in  and  respectively  of our health plan services premium revenues were generated under medicare and medicaid medi cal contracts 
these revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by the respective fiscal intermediaries 
laws and regulations governing these programs are extremely complex and subject to interpretation 
as a result  there is at least a reasonable possibility that recorded estimates will change by a material amount 
our medicare contracts are with cms 
cms deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors 
the cms risk adjustment model pays more for members whose medical history would indicate that they are expected to have higher medical costs 
under this risk adjustment methodology  cms calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis data from hospital inpatient  hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings 
we and the health care providers collect  compile and submit the necessary and available diagnosis data to cms within prescribed deadlines 
we estimate risk adjustment revenues based upon the diagnosis data submitted and expected to be submitted to cms 
on a monthly basis  we estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables to reflect allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on the creditworthiness of our customers  our historical collection rates and the age of our unpaid balances 
during this process  we also assess the recoverability of the receivables  and an allowance is recorded based upon their net realizable value 
those receivables that are deemed to be uncollectible  such as receivables from bankrupt employer groups  are fully written off against their corresponding asset account  with a debit to the allowance to the extent such an allowance was previously recorded 

table of contents reserves for claims and other settlements include reserves for claims incurred but not reported claims ibnr and received but unprocessed claims  and other liabilities including capitation payable  shared risk settlements  provider disputes  provider incentives and other reserves for our health plan services 
as of december   of reserves for claims and other settlements were attributed to claims reserves 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of changes in the reserve for claims 
we estimate the amount of our reserves for claims primarily by using standard actuarial developmental methodologies 
this method is also known as the chain ladder or completion factor method 
the developmental method estimates reserves for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid while taking into consideration  among other things  expected medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
a key component of the developmental method is the completion factor which is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the claims for services rendered for a given period 
while the completion factors are reliable and robust for older service periods  they are more volatile and less reliable for more recent periods since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to us until several months after services have been rendered 
accordingly  for the most recent months  the incurred claims are estimated from a trend analysis based on per member per month claims trends developed from the experience in preceding months 
this method is applied consistently year over year while assumptions may be adjusted to reflect changes in medical cost inflation  seasonal patterns  product mix  benefit plan changes and changes in membership 
an extensive degree of actuarial judgment is used in this estimation process  considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  and the estimates are highly sensitive to changes in medical claims submission and payment patterns and medical cost trends 
as such  the completion factors and the claims per member per month trend factor are the most significant factors used in estimating our reserves for claims 
since a large portion of the reserves for claims is attributed to the most recent months  the estimated reserves for claims are highly sensitive to these factors 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our operating results caused by these factors completion factor a percentage point increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million medical cost trend b percentage point increase decrease in factor health plan services increase decrease in reserves for claims million million million million a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to the estimate of total claims for a given period 
therefore  an increase in completion factor percent results in a decrease in the remaining estimated reserves for claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trend used to estimate the per member per month cost for the most recent three months 
other relevant factors include exceptional situations that might require judgmental adjustments in setting the reserves for claims  such as system conversions  processing interruptions or changes  environmental changes or other factors 
all of these factors are used in estimating reserves for claims and are important to our reserve methodology in trending the claims per member per month for purposes of estimating the reserves for the most 
table of contents recent months 
in developing our best estimate of reserves for claims  we consistently apply the principles and methodology described above from year to year  while also giving due consideration to the potential variability of these factors 
because reserves for claims include various actuarially developed estimates  our actual health care services expense may be more or less than our previously developed estimates 
claims processing expenses are also accrued based on an estimate of expenses necessary to process such claims 
such reserves are continually monitored and reviewed  with any adjustments reflected in current operations 
we assess the profitability of contracts for providing health care services when operating results or forecasts indicate probable future losses 
significant factors that can lead to a change in our profitability estimates include premium yield and health care cost trend assumptions  risk share terms and non performance of a provider under a capitated agreement resulting in membership reverting to fee for service arrangements with other providers 
contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with the method of determining premium rates 
losses are determined by comparing anticipated premiums to estimates for the total of health care related costs less reinsurance recoveries  if any  and the cost of maintaining the contracts 
losses  if any  are recognized in the period the losses are determined and are classified as health plan services 
we held no premium deficiency reserves as of december  government contracts the tricare north region contract is made up of two major revenue components  health care and administrative services 
health care services revenue includes health care costs  including paid claims and estimated ibnr expenses  for care provided for which we are at risk and underwriting fees earned for providing the health care and assuming underwriting risk in the delivery of care 
administrative services revenue encompasses all other services provided to both the government customer and to beneficiaries  including services such as medical management  claims processing  enrollment  customer services and other services unique to the managed care support contracts with the government 
health care costs and associated revenues are recognized as the costs are incurred and the associated revenue is earned 
revenue related to administrative services is recognized as the services are provided and earned 
revenues associated with the transition to the tricare contract for the north region are recognized over the entire term of the contract 
there are different variables that impact the estimate of the ibnr reserves for our tricare business than those that impact our managed care businesses 
these variables consist of changes in the level of our nation s military activity  including the call up of reservists in support of heightened military activity  continual changes in the number of eligible beneficiaries  changes in the health care facilities in which the eligible beneficiaries seek treatment  and revisions to the provisions of the contract in the form of change orders 
each of these factors is subject to significant judgment  and we have incorporated our best estimate of these factors in estimating the reserve for ibnr claims 
as part of our tricare contract for the north region  we have a risk sharing arrangement with the federal government whereby variances in actual claim experience from the targeted medical claim amount negotiated in our annual bid are shared 
due to this risk sharing arrangement provided for in the tricare contract for the north region  the changes in the estimate of the ibnr reserves are not expected to have a material effect on the favorable or adverse development of our liability under the tricare contract 
other government contracts revenues are recognized in the month in which the eligible beneficiaries are entitled to health care services or in the month in which the administrative services are performed or the period that coverage for services is provided 
under our tricare contract for the north region we recognize amounts receivable and payable under the government contracts related to estimated health care ibnr expenses which are reported separately on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  these amounts are the same since all of the estimated health care ibnr expenses incurred are offset by an equal amount of revenues earned 

table of contents some of the amounts receivable under government contracts are comprised primarily of contractually defined billings  deferred underwriting fees under the terms of the contract and change orders for services not originally specified in the contracts 
change orders arise because the government often directs us to implement changes to our contracts before the scope and or value is defined or negotiated 
we start to incur costs immediately  before we have proposed a price to the government 
in these situations  we make no attempt to estimate and record revenue 
our policy is to defer the costs as incurred until we have submitted a cost proposal to the government  at which time we will record the costs and the appropriate value for revenue  using our best estimate of what will ultimately be negotiated 
in the normal course of contracting with the federal government  we may make claims for contract and price adjustments arising from cost overruns against the government 
we recognize such claims when the amounts become determinable  supportable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
reserves for contingent liabilities in the course of our operations  we are involved on a routine basis in various disputes with members  health care providers  and other entities  as well as audits by government agencies that relate to our services and or business practices that expose us to potential losses 
we recognize an estimated loss  which may represent damages  settlement costs  future legal expenses or a combination of the foregoing  as appropriate  from such loss contingencies when it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our loss estimates are based in part on an analysis of potential results  the stage of the proceedings  consultation with outside counsel and any other relevant information available 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets arise primarily as a result of various business acquisitions and consist of identifiable intangible assets acquired and the excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value of employer group contracts  provider networks and customer relationships  which are all subject to amortization 
we perform our annual impairment test on our recorded goodwill as of june or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that we might not recover the carrying value of these assets for each of our reporting units 
health plan services was our only reporting unit with goodwill as of december  during the three months ended september   we reviewed our reportable segments following the execution of the stock purchase agreement to sell the acquired companies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
upon the execution of the stock purchase agreement  we determined that we needed to expand our reportable segments to the west operations  northeast operations and government contracts see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on our segment changes 
also  at the time we entered into the stock purchase agreement  it became more likely than not that the acquired companies would be sold within a year 
as a result  we determined that the requirements to classify the acquired companies assets and liabilities as held for sale were met during the three months ended september  assets and liabilities held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell 
prior to measuring the acquired companies assets and liabilities to be held for sale at the lower of cost of fair value less cost to sell  we adjusted the carrying values of the assets and liabilities  including goodwill 
during the three months ended september   we reallocated goodwill and assessed the goodwill for impairment 
the goodwill allocations were based on the relative fair values of the west operations  the northeast operations to be sold acquired companies and the northeast operations reporting unit to be retained to provide administrative services to united and its affiliates 
our fair value measurements are based on a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
the market approach uses a market valuation methodology which includes the selection of companies engaged in 
table of contents a line or lines of business similar to ours to be valued and an analysis of our comparative operating results and future prospects in relation to those of the guideline companies selected 
the income approach is based on the discounted cash flow methodology 
the discounted cash flow methodology is based on converting expected cash flows to their present value 
annual cash flows are estimated each year of a defined multi year period until the growth pattern becomes stable 
the interim cash flows expected after the growth pattern becomes stable are calculated using an appropriate capitalization technique and then discounted 
there are numerous assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the estimated fair values  including assumptions and estimates related to future earnings and membership levels based on current and future plans and initiatives  long term strategies and our annual planning and forecasting processes  as well as the expected weighted average cost of capital used in the discount process 
if the planned initiatives do not accomplish their targeted objectives  the assumptions and estimates underlying the goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected and have a material effect upon our financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
in connection with the goodwill allocation and related impairment testing  our fair value estimates contemplated the consideration expected to be received in connection with the northeast sale  including the cash proceeds  contingent consideration for membership renewal  the receivable for the remaining adjusted tangible net equity and the other deliverables which are part of the stock purchase agreement see note to our consolidated financial statements 
after the reallocation of the goodwill  we performed a two step impairment test to determine the existence of impairment and the amount of the impairment 
in the first step  we compared the fair values of our reporting units to the related carrying values and concluded that the carrying value of the acquired companies was impaired  however  we determined that the carrying value of the northeast retained business and the west operations were not impaired 
in the second step we measured the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied value of the acquired companies goodwill to the carrying amount of such goodwill 
based on the results of our step test  we concluded that the implied value of the goodwill allocated to the acquired companies was zero  which resulted in an impairment charge for the total carrying value of the allocated goodwill of million 
we updated our goodwill impairment assessment test performed as of september  to december  and no additional impairment was indicated 
after impairing the goodwill  we compared the acquired companies adjusted carrying value to its estimated fair value less cost to sell 
the carrying value of the assets and liabilities held for sale exceeded the fair value less cost to sell by approximately million 
as of september   the assets and liabilities held for sale included million in other intangible assets and we reduced the carrying value of these intangibles by the million 
additionally  upon classifying the acquired companies assets and liabilities as held for sale we ceased recording amortization expense related to these intangible assets 
on december   we completed the northeast sale see note to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the northeast sale 
recoverability of long lived assets and investments we periodically assess the recoverability of our long lived assets including property and equipment and other long term assets and investments where events and changes in circumstances would indicate that we might not recover the carrying value as follows long lived assets held and used we test long lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant decreases in the market price of the asset  significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses 
table of contents or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if we identify an indicator of impairment  we assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
during the year ended december   we recorded such impairments totaling million  including million in property and equipment in connection with the northeast sale see note to our consolidated financial statements  million in connection with our operations strategy and an other than temporary impairment of  of investment securities 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated by applying enacted tax rates and laws to taxable years in which such differences are expected to reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of the income taxes topic of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize the benefits from our deferred tax assets only when an analysis of both positive and negative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that the benefits will be realized 
we file tax returns in many tax jurisdictions 
often  application of tax rules within the various jurisdictions is subject to differing interpretation 
despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that it is probable certain positions will be challenged by taxing authorities  and we may not prevail on the positions as filed 
accordingly  we maintain a liability for the estimated amount of contingent tax challenges by taxing authorities upon examination  in accordance with the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification the interpretation requires us to analyze the amount at which each tax position meets a more likely than not standard for sustainability upon examination by taxing authorities 
only tax benefit amounts meeting or exceeding this standard will be reflected in tax provision expense and deferred tax asset balances 
the interpretation also requires that any differences between the amounts of tax benefits reported on tax returns and tax benefits reported in the financial statements be recorded in a liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is reported separately from deferred tax assets and liabilities and classified as current or noncurrent based upon the expected period of payment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate and market risk primarily due to our investing and borrowing activities 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and in equity prices 
interest rate risk is a consequence of maintaining variable interest rate earning investments and fixed rate liabilities or fixed income investments and variable rate liabilities 
we are exposed to interest rate risks arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates  prepayment speeds and or the shape and slope of the yield curve 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk of loss related to changes in credit spreads 
credit spread risk arises from the potential changes in an issuer s credit rating or credit perception that will affect the value of financial instruments 
we attempt to manage the interest rate risks related to our investment portfolios by actively managing the asset duration of our investment portfolios 
the overall goal for the investment portfolios is to provide a source of liquidity and support the ongoing operations of our business units 
our philosophy is to actively manage assets to maximize total return over a multiple year time horizon  subject to appropriate levels of risk 
each business unit has additional requirements with respect to liquidity  current income and contribution to surplus 
we manage 
table of contents these risks by setting risk tolerances  targeting asset class allocations  diversifying among assets and asset characteristics  and using performance measurement and reporting 
we use a value at risk var model  which follows a variance co variance methodology  to assess the market risk for our investment portfolio 
var is a method of assessing investment risk that uses standard statistical techniques to measure the worst expected loss in the portfolio over an assumed portfolio disposition period under normal market conditions 
the determination is made at a given statistical confidence level 
we assumed a portfolio disposition period of days with a confidence level of for the computation of var for the computation further assumes that the distribution of returns is normal 
based on such methodology and assumptions  the computed var was approximately million as of december  our calculated var exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that could be recognized on our investment portfolios assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and are not necessarily indicative of actual results which may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our investment portfolios during the year 
except for those securities held by trustees or regulatory agencies see note to our consolidated financial statements  all of our investment securities are designated as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at their estimated fair value  with the difference between cost and estimated fair value reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity see note to the consolidated financial statements 
virtually  all of our investment securities are fixed income securities 
approximately of our available for sale investment securities are mortgage backed securities mbs and include both current and non current investments 
approximately of the mbs are agency securities 
therefore  we believe that our exposure to credit related market value risk for our mbs is limited 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of fixed income securities would be expected to increase 
however  these securities may be negatively impacted by illiquidity in the market 
the recent disruptions in the credit markets have negatively impacted the liquidity of investments 
however  such disruptions did not have a material impact to the liquidity of our investments 
a worsening of credit market disruptions or sustained market downturns could have negative effects on the liquidity and value of our investment assets 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which totaled million as of december   are subject to variable interest rates 
for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our floating rate borrowings  if any  are presumed to have equal book and fair values because the interest rates paid on these borrowings  if any  are based on prevailing market rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate borrowings  including our senior notes and financing facility as of december   was approximately million  which was based on quoted market prices 
where quoted market prices were not readily available  fair values were estimated using valuation methodologies based on available and observable market information 
such valuation methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing  comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business  and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows 
the following table presents the expected cash outflows relating to market risk sensitive debt obligations as of 
table of contents december  these cash outflows include expected principal and interest payments consistent with the terms of the outstanding debt as of december  thereafter total amounts in millions fixed rate borrowings principal interest valuation of interest rate swap contracts cash outflow on fixed rate borrowings floating rate borrowings principal interest cash outflow on floating rate borrowings total cash outflow on borrowings
