item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
additional sections in this report which should be helpful to the reading of our discussion and analysis include the following i a description of our business strategy found in items and business and properties c narrative description of business business strategy  ii a description of developments during  found in items and business and properties a general development of business recent developments  and iii a description of risk factors affecting us and our business  found in item a risk factors 
inasmuch as the discussion below and the other sections to which we have referred you pertain to management s comments on financial resources  capital spending  our business strategy and the outlook for our business  such discussions contain forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements reflect the expectations  beliefs  plans and objectives of management about future financial performance and assumptions underlying management s judgment concerning the matters discussed  and accordingly  involve estimates  assumptions  judgments and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to any differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly in risk factors and information regarding forward looking statements 
general our business model is built to support two principal components helping customers by providing energy  bulk commodity and liquids products transportation  storage and distribution  and creating long term value for our unitholders 
to achieve these objectives  we focus on providing fee based services to customers from a business portfolio consisting of energy related pipelines  bulk and liquids terminal facilities  and carbon dioxide and petroleum reserves 
our reportable business segments are based on the way our management organizes our enterprise  and each of our five segments represents a component of our enterprise that engages in a separate business activity and for which discrete financial information is available 

table of contents our five reportable business segments are products pipelines the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products pipelines that deliver gasoline  diesel fuel  jet fuel and natural gas liquids to various markets  plus the ownership and or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities  natural gas pipelines the ownership and operation of major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems  plus the ownership and or operation of associated natural gas processing and treating facilities  co i the production  transportation and marketing of carbon dioxide  referred to as co  to oil fields that use co to increase production of oil  ii ownership interests in and or operation of oil fields in west texas  and iii the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in west texas  terminals the ownership and or operation of liquids and bulk terminal facilities and rail transloading and materials handling facilities located throughout the united states and portions of canada  and kinder morgan canada i the ownership and operation of the trans mountain pipeline system that transports crude oil and refined petroleum products from edmonton  alberta  canada to marketing terminals and refineries in british columbia  canada and the state of washington  and ii the interest in the express crude oil pipeline system  which connects canadian and us producers to refineries located in the us rocky mountain and midwest regions  and the jet fuel aviation turbine fuel pipeline that serves the vancouver canada international airport 
as an energy infrastructure owner and operator in multiple facets of the united states and canada s various energy businesses and markets  we examine a number of variables and factors on a routine basis to evaluate our current performance and our prospects for the future 
many of our operations are regulated by various us and canadian regulatory bodies 
the profitability of our products pipeline transportation business is generally driven by the utilization of our facilities in relation to their capacity  as well as the prices we receive for our services 
transportation volume levels are primarily driven by the demand for the petroleum products being shipped or stored  and the prices for shipping are generally based on regulated tariffs that are adjusted annually based on changes in the us producer price index 
because of the overall effect of utilization on our products pipeline transportation business  we seek to own refined products pipelines located in  or that transport to  stable or growing markets and population centers 
with respect to our interstate natural gas pipelines and related storage facilities  the revenues from these assets tend to be received under contracts with terms that are fixed for various periods of time 
to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors  we generally attempt to mitigate risk of reduced volumes and prices by negotiating contracts with longer terms  with higher per unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity 
however  changes  either positive or negative  in actual quantities transported on our interstate natural gas pipelines may not accurately measure or predict associated changes in profitability because many of the underlying transportation contracts  sometimes referred to as take or pay contracts  specify that we receive the majority of our fee for making the capacity available  whether or not the customer actually chooses to utilize the capacity 
our co sales and transportation business  like our natural gas pipelines business  generally has take or pay contracts  although the contracts in our co business typically have minimum volume requirements 
in the long term  our success in this business is driven by the demand for carbon dioxide 
however  short term changes in the demand for carbon dioxide typically do not have a significant impact on us due to the required minimum transport volumes under many of our contracts 
in the oil and gas producing activities within our co business segment  we monitor the amount of capital we expend in relation to the amount of production that is added or the amount of declines in oil and gas production that are postponed 
in that regard  our production during any period and the reserves that we add during that period are important measures 
in addition  the revenues we receive from our crude oil  natural gas liquids and carbon dioxide sales are affected by the prices we realize from the sale of these products 
over the long term  we will tend to receive prices that are dictated by the demand and overall market price for these products 
in the shorter term  however  published market prices are likely not indicative of the revenues we will receive due to our risk management  or hedging  program in which the prices to be realized for certain of our future sales quantities are fixed  capped or bracketed through the use of financial derivative contracts  particularly for crude oil 
as with our pipeline transportation businesses  the profitability of our terminals businesses is generally driven by the utilization of our terminals facilities in relation to their capacity  as well as the prices we receive for our services  which in turn are driven by the demand for the products being shipped or stored 
the extent to which changes in these variables affect our terminals businesses in the near term is a function of the length of the underlying service contracts  the extent to which revenues under the contracts are a function of the amount of product stored or transported  and the extent to which such contracts expire during any given period of time 
to the extent practicable and economically feasible in light of our strategic plans and other factors  we generally attempt to mitigate the risk of reduced volumes and pricing by negotiating contracts with longer terms  with higher per unit pricing and for a greater percentage of our available capacity 
in addition  weather related factors such as hurricanes  floods and droughts may impact our facilities and access to them and  thus  the profitability of certain terminals for limited periods of time or  in relatively rare cases of severe damage to facilities  for longer periods 

table of contents in our discussions of the operating results of individual businesses which follow  we generally identify the important fluctuations between periods that are attributable to acquisitions and dispositions separately from those that are attributable to businesses owned in both periods 
we believe that we have a history of making accretive acquisitions and economically advantageous expansions of existing businesses 
our ability to increase earnings and increase distributions to our unitholders will  to some extent  be a function of completing successful acquisitions and expansions 
we continue to have opportunities for expansion of our facilities in many markets  and we expect to continue to have such opportunities in the future  although the level of such opportunities is difficult to predict 
our ability to make accretive acquisitions is a function of the availability of suitable acquisition candidates and  to some extent  our ability to raise necessary capital to fund such acquisitions  factors over which we have limited or no control 
thus  we have no way to determine the number or size of accretive acquisition candidates in the future  or whether we will complete the acquisition of any such candidates 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting standards require information in financial statements about the risks and uncertainties inherent in significant estimates  and the application of generally accepted accounting principles involves the exercise of varying degrees of judgment 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for our assets and liabilities  our revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we routinely evaluate these estimates  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates  and any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures  examples of certain areas that require more judgment relative to others include our use of estimates in determining i the economic useful lives of our assets  ii the fair values used to allocate purchase price from business combinations  determine possible asset impairment charges  and calculate the annual goodwill impairment test  iii reserves for environmental claims  legal fees  transportation rate cases and other litigation liabilities  iv provisions for uncollectible accounts receivables  v exposures under contractual indemnifications  and vi unbilled revenues 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe that certain accounting policies are of more significance in our consolidated financial statement preparation process than others  which policies are discussed as follows 
environmental matters with respect to our environmental exposure  we utilize both internal staff and external experts to assist us in identifying environmental issues and in estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts 
we expense or capitalize  as appropriate  environmental expenditures that relate to current operations  and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs 
we do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value  and we recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable 
our recording of our environmental accruals often coincides with our completion of a feasibility study or our commitment to a formal plan of action  but generally  we recognize and or adjust our environmental liabilities following routine reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations 
these adjustments may result in increases in environmental expenses and are primarily related to quarterly reviews of potential environmental issues and resulting environmental liability estimates 

table of contents these environmental liability adjustments are recorded pursuant to our management s requirement to recognize contingent environmental liabilities whenever the associated environmental issue is likely to occur and the amount of our liability can be reasonably estimated 
in making these liability estimations  we consider the effect of environmental compliance  pending legal actions against us  and potential third party liability claims 
for more information on our environmental disclosures  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
legal matters we are subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings as a result of our business operations and transactions 
we utilize both internal and external counsel in evaluating our potential exposure to adverse outcomes from orders  judgments or settlements 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates  our earnings will be affected 
in general  we expense legal costs as incurred 
when we identify specific litigation that is expected to continue for a significant period of time and require substantial expenditures  we identify a range of possible costs expected to be required to litigate the matter to a conclusion or reach an acceptable settlement 
generally  if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount  we record a liability equal to the low end of the range 
any such liability recorded is revised as better information becomes available 
as of december   our most significant ongoing litigation proceedings involved our west coast products pipelines 
tariffs charged by certain of these pipeline systems are subject to certain proceedings at the ferc involving shippers complaints regarding the interstate rates  as well as practices and the jurisdictional nature of certain facilities and services 
generally  the interstate rates on our product pipeline systems are grandfathered under the energy policy act of unless substantially changed circumstances are found to exist 
to the extent substantially changed circumstances are found to exist  our west coast products pipeline operations may be subject to substantial exposure under these ferc complaints and could  therefore  owe reparations and or refunds to complainants as mandated by the ferc or the united states judicial system 
for more information on our ferc regulatory proceedings  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
intangible assets intangible assets are those assets which provide future economic benefit but have no physical substance 
identifiable intangible assets having indefinite useful economic lives  including goodwill  are not subject to regular periodic amortization  and such assets are not to be amortized until their lives are determined to be finite 
instead  the carrying amount of a recognized intangible asset with an indefinite useful life must be tested for impairment annually or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
there have not been any significant changes in these estimates during  however  during the second quarter of  we changed the date of our annual goodwill impairment test date to may of each year from january 
we have determined that our goodwill was not impaired as of may  in addition  the acquisition of our trans mountain pipeline system from kmi on april  announced on april  caused kmi to consider the fair value of the trans mountain pipeline system and to determine whether goodwill related to these assets was impaired 
kmi used a discounted cash flow analysis to compare the fair market value of the trans mountain reporting unit to its carrying value  and since the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  kmi determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the first quarter of this impairment is also reflected in our accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  due to the accounting principles for transfers of assets between entities under common control  which required us to both transfer the assets and liabilities of the trans mountain pipeline system from kmi to us at their carrying value and to account for trans mountain as if the transfer had taken place on january  for more information on our goodwill  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
for more information on our acquisition of trans mountain  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
excluding goodwill  our other intangible assets include customer relationships  contracts and agreements  lease value  and technology based assets 
these intangible assets have definite lives  are being amortized in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives  and are reported separately as other intangibles  net in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
for more information on our amortizable intangibles  see note goodwill and other intangibles other intangibles to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents estimated net recoverable quantities of oil and gas we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas producing activities 
the successful efforts method inherently relies on the estimation of proved reserves  both developed and undeveloped 
the existence and the estimated amount of proved reserves affect  among other things  whether certain costs are capitalized or expensed  the amount and timing of costs depleted or amortized into income  and the presentation of supplemental information on oil and gas producing activities 
the expected future cash flows to be generated by oil and gas producing properties used in testing for impairment of such properties also rely in part on estimates of net recoverable quantities of oil and gas 
proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geologic and engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
estimates of proved reserves may change  either positively or negatively  as additional information becomes available and as contractual  economic and political conditions change 
for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
hedging activities we engage in a hedging program that utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate offset our exposure to fluctuations in energy commodity prices and to balance our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates  and we believe that these hedges are generally effective in realizing these objectives 
according to the provisions of current accounting standards  to be considered effective  changes in the value of a derivative contract or its resulting cash flows must substantially offset changes in the value or cash flows of the item being hedged  and any ineffective portion of the hedge gain or loss and any component excluded from the computation of the effectiveness of the derivative contract must be reported in earnings immediately 
since it is not always possible for us to engage in a hedging transaction that completely mitigates our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices a perfectly effective hedge we often enter into hedges that are not completely effective in those instances where we believe to do so would be better than not hedging at all 
but because the part of such hedging transactions that is not effective in offsetting undesired changes in commodity prices the ineffective portion is required to be recognized currently in earnings  our financial statements may reflect a gain or loss arising from an exposure to commodity prices for which we are unable to enter into a completely effective hedge 
for example  when we purchase a commodity at one location and sell it at another  we may be unable to hedge completely our exposure to a differential in the price of the product between these two locations  accordingly  our financial statements may reflect some volatility due to these hedges 
for more information on our hedging activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

table of contents segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses because our partnership agreement requires us to distribute of our available cash to our partners on a quarterly basis available cash as defined in our partnership agreement generally consists of all our cash receipts  less cash disbursements and changes in reserves  we consider each period s earnings before all non cash depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  including amortization of excess cost of equity investments  to be an important measure of our success in maximizing returns to our partners 
we also use segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses defined in the table above and sometimes referred to in this report as ebda internally as a measure of profit and loss used for evaluating segment performance and for deciding how to allocate resources to our five reportable business segments 
in  our total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by approximately both before and after taking into effect the combined certain items described in the footnotes to the table above combined  the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above decreased segment ebda by million in and decreased segment ebda by million in 
the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization consisted of year to year increases from all five of our business segments  with the strongest growth coming from our terminals and products pipelines business segments 
during  we benefitted from i reduced operating expenses including lower fuel and power and expenses  due in part from ongoing weak economic conditions during the year which decreased total bulk tonnage and refined petroleum products delivery volumes  ii higher ethanol storage and blending revenues at existing and expanded refined petroleum products terminal facilities  iii the start up of the rockies express east  midcontinent express and kinder morgan louisiana natural gas pipelines  and iv a full year impact from the rockies express west natural gas pipeline 
in  total segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million compared to  and combined  the certain items described in the footnotes to the tables above accounted for million of the overall increase combining to decrease segment ebda by million in and to decrease segment ebda by million in 
the remaining million increase in total segment ebda included higher earnings in from our co  natural gas pipelines  terminals and kinder morgan canada business segments  and lower earnings from our products pipelines business segment 
during  we benefitted from i higher revenues from crude oil and carbon dioxide sales  ii the start up of the rockies express west natural gas pipeline  iii improved margins from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group  iv incremental earnings from expanded bulk and liquids terminal operations  and v a full year impact of trans mountain and its system expansions 
the year to year decrease in earnings from our products pipelines segment was primarily due to a continued slowing economy at the end of and to the negative impact of higher energy prices primarily in the first three quarters of on demand for petroleum products  which negatively impacted our deliveries of gasoline  diesel and jet fuel in versus products pipelines year ended december  in millions  except operating statistics revenues a operating expenses b other income expense c earnings from equity investments d interest income and other  net income expense e income tax benefit expense f earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and amortization of excess cost of equity investments gasoline mmbbl g diesel fuel mmbbl jet fuel mmbbl total refined product volumes mmbbl natural gas liquids mmbbl total delivery volumes mmbbl h

all of the assets and operations included in our products pipelines business segment reported higher earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in  when compared to  and the primary increases and decreases in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to were attributable to the following a million increase in earnings from our pacific operations consisting of an million decrease in combined operating expenses  a million increase in total operating revenues  and a million decrease in other operating and non operating income items  relative to the decrease in our pacific operations operating expenses in versus was primarily due to the following i overall cost reductions due in part to a decrease in overall mainline delivery volumes and delays in certain non critical spending  ii lower fuel and power  and outside services expenses  iii higher product gains  iv lower right of way and environmental expenses  and v lower legal expenses due in part to incremental expenses associated with certain litigation settlements reached in 
the year over year increase in operating revenues was driven by higher delivery revenues to us military customers  due to military tender increases in  annual tariff rate increases which positively impacted our california products delivery revenues  and higher terminal revenues  primarily related to incremental ethanol handling services  a million increase in earnings from our west coast terminal operations largely revenue related  driven by higher revenues from our combined carson los angeles harbor terminal system and by incremental returns from the completion of a number of capital expansion projects that modified and upgraded terminal infrastructure since the end of last year 
revenues at our carson los angeles terminal complex increased million in versus  due mainly to both increased warehouse charges escalated warehousing contract rates resulting from customer contract revisions made since the end of and to new customers including incremental terminaling for us defense fuel services 
revenues from our remaining west coast facilities increased million in versus  due mostly to additional throughput and storage services associated with renewable fuels both ethanol and biodiesel  and partly to incremental revenues of million from the terminals portland  oregon airport pipeline  which was acquired on july   a million increase in earnings from our central florida pipeline driven by incremental ethanol revenues and higher refined products delivery revenues  when compared to the increase from ethanol handling resulted from completed capital expansion projects that provided ethanol storage and terminal service beginning in mid april at our tampa and orlando terminals  and the increase in pipeline delivery revenues was driven by higher average transportation rates that reflect two separate mid year tariff rate increases that became effective july  and  a million increase in earnings from our transmix operations mainly due to a combined million increase in revenues in  associated with certain true ups related to transmix settlement gains  
table of contents a million increase in earnings from our approximate equity ownership in the plantation pipe line company 
plantation s net income increased as a result of higher pipeline transportation revenues due to both higher volumes and average tariffs and incremental other income in from insurance reimbursements related to the settlement of certain previous environmental matters 
the decrease in revenues associated with our investment in plantation in compared to was mainly due to a restructuring of the plantation operating agreement between exxonmobil and us 
on january   both parties agreed to reduce the fixed operating fees we earn from operating the pipeline and to charge pipeline operating expenses directly to plantation  resulting in a minimal impact to our earnings 
accordingly  the million reduction in our fee revenues in was offset by a corresponding decrease in our operating expenses of million  and a million increase in earnings from our calnev pipeline driven by a million reduction in combined fuel and power expenses in versus the drop in fuel and power expenses was due primarily to an overall decrease in refined products delivery volumes  chiefly due to lower diesel volumes 
the overall decreases in both segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses and segment revenues in compared to were primarily the result of the october divestiture of our north system pipeline system and our ownership interest in the heartland pipeline company collectively referred to in this report as our north system to oneok partners  lp following purchase price adjustments  we received approximately million in cash for the sale 
we accounted for our north system business as a discontinued operation pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles which require that our income statement be formatted to separate the divested business from our continuing operations  however  because the sale of our north system did not change the structure of our internal organization in a manner that caused a change to our reportable business segments  we included the north system s operating results within our products pipelines business segment disclosures for all periods presented in this discussion and analysis 
this decision was based on the way our management organizes segments internally to make operating decisions and assess performance 
our north system generated million of earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in prior to the effective sale date of october  in addition  we recognized a million gain on disposal of the north system in the fourth quarter of  and we recorded incremental gain adjustments of million in the gains  unlike the earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  are not reflected in the operating results above but are instead included within the certain items described in the footnotes to the table immediately following the heading products pipelines above

following is information on other year to year increases and decreases in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to a million decrease in earnings from our pacific operations primarily due to an increase in system wide operating and maintenance expenses in versus the increase primarily reflects lower product gains in  due both to lower physical gains and to the impact of unfavorable changes in diesel fuel versus gasoline prices  lower capitalized overhead credits  due to lower capital spending in  higher labor and payroll expenses  due to an increase in headcount  and incremental expenses associated with litigation and right of way liability adjustments 
total revenues earned by our pacific operations in were essentially flat compared to  as higher pipeline delivery revenues were largely offset by lower fee based terminal revenues 
the year over year increase in refined products delivery revenues resulted from both higher average tariff rates in and a more favorable delivery mix of higher rate east line volumes versus lower rate west line volumes  a million decrease in earnings from our equity investment in plantation pipe line company due mainly to lower overall net income earned by plantation as a result of lower product transportation and pipeline service revenues 
in  pipeline throughput volumes dropped compared to the previous year 
the drop in delivery volumes was due to a combination of decreased demand due to lower product consumption  supply disruptions caused by hurricane related refinery outages  and a volume shift by customers to competing pipelines  
table of contents a combined million increase in earnings from our southeast and west coast terminal operations primarily related to higher margins on liquids inventory sales  increased earnings from incremental terminal throughput and storage activity at higher rates  and incremental returns from the completion of a number of capital expansion projects that modified and upgraded terminal infrastructure since the end of  enabling us to provide additional terminal and ethanol related services to our customers  a million increase in earnings from our cochin pipeline system driven largely by a year end reduction in income tax expense  related to lower canadian operating results in and to canadian income tax liability adjustments 
the decrease in income tax expense more than offset a drop in operating revenues that was primarily related to lower pipeline transportation revenues in the decrease in delivery revenues was due both to a continued decrease in demand for propane in eastern canadian and midwestern us petrochemical and fuel markets since the end of and to cochin s ceasing of ethane transportation in july  and a million increase in earnings from our central florida pipeline chiefly due to higher revenues relative to the increase in revenues was driven by incremental ethanol terminal revenues that began in april  incremental ethanol pipeline transportation revenues that began in october  and higher refined product delivery revenues  driven by an increase in the average tariff as a result of a mid year tariff rate increase on product deliveries

we account for our investments in midcontinent express and rockies express under the equity method of accounting 
our kinder morgan louisiana pipeline commenced limited natural gas transportation service on the pipeline system in april  and construction was fully completed and transportation service on the system s remaining portions began in full on june  the overall incremental earnings in compared to consisted of operating income revenues less operating expenses of million and non operating other income of million  primarily due to higher non cash allowances for capital funds used during construction 
pursuant to ferc regulations governing allowances for capital funds that are used for pipeline construction costs an equity cost of capital allowance  we were allowed a reasonable return on the construction costs that we funded by equity contributions  similar to the allowance for capital costs funded by borrowings 
the incremental equity earnings from midcontinent express also relates to the start up of natural gas transportation service in the system commenced interim service for zone of its pipeline system on april   with deliveries to natural gas pipeline company of america llc 
natural gas service to all zone delivery points occurred by may   and on august   the system s remaining portion zone was placed into service 
currently  the pipeline system can provide transportation service for up to billion cubic feet per day of natural gas  and the pipeline capacity is fully subscribed with long term binding commitments from creditworthy shippers 

table of contents the increase in earnings from rockies express was primarily attributable to both the completion and start up of the rockies express east pipeline segment in and to the inclusion of a full year of operations from the rockies express west pipeline segment 
the rockies express east line is the third and final phase of the rockies express joint venture project 
it began initial pipeline service on june   and began full operations on november  the rockies express west line began initial pipeline service on january   and began full operations on may  on november   a pipeline girth weld failure on the rockies express east line resulted in approximately miles of the pipeline being shutdown 
the pipeline was placed back into service at a reduced capacity on january   and at full capacity on february  the negative impact on our equity earnings from rockies express in the fourth quarter of was approximately million 
following is information on other year over year increases and decreases in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to a million increase in earnings from our kinder morgan interstate gas transmission pipeline system driven by higher operational gas sales margins  higher firm transportation demand fees resulting from both system expansions and incremental ethanol customers  and higher pipeline fuel recoveries kmigt s operational gas sales are primarily made possible by its collection of fuel in kind pursuant to its transportation tariffs and recovery of storage cushion gas volumes  incremental earnings of million from our subsidiary kinder morgan gas treating  lp  which acquired the natural gas treating business from crosstex energy  lp and crosstex energy  inc effective october  the business consists of multiple natural gas treating plants  predominantly located in texas and louisiana  that are used to remove impurities and liquids from natural gas in order to meet pipeline quality specifications  a million decrease in earnings from our transcolorado pipeline primarily due to a million drop in natural gas transportation revenues and partly to increases in both pipeline remediation expenses and property tax expenses in compared to the decrease in transportation revenues related primarily to the negative impact caused by the increased transportation service offered by a competing pipeline in  and a million decrease in earnings from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group mainly attributable to i lower margins from natural gas sales  primarily due to lower sales volumes and to higher supply prices relative to sales prices in the increase in supply prices resulted from a decline in field volumes being replaced with more expensive supplies from more liquid supply locations in  ii lower natural gas processing margins  due to unfavorable gross processing spreads as a result of significantly lower average natural gas liquids prices in  and iii higher system operational expenses  due primarily to higher pipeline integrity expenses relative to last year 
the overall decreases in earnings were partially offset by higher year to year natural gas storage margins which resulted from favorable proprietary and fee based storage activities and from the leasing of additional storage capacity to customers from completed capital expansion projects 
our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group includes the operations of the following four natural gas pipeline systems kinder morgan tejas including kinder morgan border pipeline  kinder morgan texas pipeline  kinder morgan north texas pipeline and our mier monterrey mexico pipeline  and combined  the group accounted for and  respectively  of the segment s earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in and  and  respectively  of the segment s revenues in and  and and  respectively  of the segment s operating expenses in and for each of the years  and  the overall changes in both segment revenues and segment operating expenses which include natural gas costs of sales primarily relate to the natural gas purchase and sale activities of our intrastate group  with the variances from year to year in both revenues and operating expenses mainly due to corresponding changes in the intrastate group s average prices and volumes for natural gas purchased and sold 
the group both purchases and sells significant volumes of natural gas  which is often stored and or transported on its pipelines  and because the group generally sells natural gas in the same price environment in which it is purchased  the increases and decreases in its gas sales revenues are largely offset by corresponding increases and decreases in gas purchase costs 
with regard to natural gas sales activity  our intrastate group s business strategy involves relying both on long and short term natural gas sales and purchase agreements  and we use this flexibility to help optimize the margins we realize by capturing favorable differences due to changes in timing  location  prices and volumes 
to the extent possible  we balance the pricing and timing of our natural gas purchases to our natural gas sales  and our purchase and sales contracts are frequently settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales 
generally  we attempt to lock in an acceptable margin by capturing the difference between our average gas sales prices and our average gas purchase and cost of fuel prices 

table of contents the most significant increases to segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to were incremental contributions from our investment in rockies express and from our texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group 
the increase from rockies express was driven by the start up of service on the rockies express west line  discussed above  and the increase in earnings from our intrastate group was primarily due to higher margins on renewal and incremental sales contracts  higher natural gas transportation revenues  greater value from natural gas storage activities  and higher natural gas processing margins 
the earnings improvement from the intrastate group s higher natural gas sales margins in reflected more favorable market conditions and year over year customer growth compared to the prior year 
the increases in earnings from natural gas transportation and fee based storage activities were due primarily to higher volumes and rates and partly to incremental revenues due to a long term contract with one of the group s largest customers that became effective april  the increase in gas processing margins in versus was largely due to more favorable price changes in natural gas liquids relative to the price of natural gas 
the following is information on other year over year increases and decreases in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to incremental earnings of million from our kinder morgan louisiana pipeline reflecting other non operating income realized in pursuant to ferc regulations governing allowances for capital funds that are used for pipeline construction costs an equity cost of capital allowance  an million increase in earnings from our transcolorado pipeline reflecting natural gas transportation contract improvements  pipeline expansions completed since the end of  and an increase in natural gas production in the piceance and san juan basins of new mexico and colorado  a million increase in earnings from our kinder morgan interstate gas transmission system driven by lower power expenses  due to decreased electricity use and lower negotiated rates in  a higher gross margin due to both higher operational natural gas sales margins and additional transportation revenues  and lower tax expenses payable to the state of texas  an million decrease in earnings from our casper douglas gas processing operations primarily attributable to higher natural gas purchase costs  due to increases in both prices and volumes  relative to the higher cost of sales expense more than offset a year to year revenue increase resulting from both higher average prices on natural gas liquids sales and higher sales of excess natural gas  and a million decrease in earnings from our trailblazer pipeline mainly due to a drop in revenues in  relative to  due mainly to lower revenues from both the sales of excess natural gas and interruptible natural gas transportation services

table of contents year ended december  versus year ended december  ebda increase decrease revenues increase decrease in millions  except percentages sales and transportation activities oil and gas producing activities intrasegment eliminations total co the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses in compared to was due to a million increase in earnings from its oil and gas producing activities  which include the operations associated with its ownership interests in oil producing fields and natural gas processing plants 
generally  earnings from the segment s oil and gas producing activities align closely with the revenues it earns from both crude oil and natural gas plant products sales  but the overall increase in earnings in consisted of i a million increase from lower oil and gas related operating expenses  ii a million decrease from lower revenues  and iii a million decrease in other income items 
the overall decrease in combined operating expenses in consisted of a million decrease in oil and gas related field operating and maintenance expenses including all cost of sales and fuel and power expenses  and a million decrease in taxes  other than income tax expenses 
the decrease in operating expenses in compared to was primarily due to i lower prices charged by the industry s material and service providers for items such as outside services  maintenance  and well workover services  which impacted rig costs  other materials and services  and capital and exploratory costs  ii lower fuel and utility rates  and iii the successful renewal of lower priced service and supply contracts negotiated by our co segment since the end of the overall decrease in other tax expenses  relative to  was driven by a decrease in severance tax expenses  related both to the decrease in natural gas liquids and crude oil sales revenues discussed following and to a million favorable adjustment to our accrued severance tax liabilities due to prior year overpayments 
the overall million decline in oil and gas related revenues in versus was driven by a million decrease in natural gas liquids sales revenues  but partly offset by a million increase in crude oil sales revenues  due to a increase in crude oil sales volumes 
the decrease in liquids sales revenues was due entirely to a decrease in the realized weighted average price per barrel of liquids in  however  the decrease in revenues caused by lower natural gas liquids realizations in was partly offset by higher revenues resulting from a increase in natural gas liquids sales volumes in  due in part to the negative impact on sales volumes in from hurricane ike 
our realized weighted average price per barrel of oil was essentially flat across both and  although average industry price levels for crude oil have increased since the beginning of because prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids are subject to external factors over which we have no control  and because future price changes may be volatile  our co business segment is exposed to price risk related to the price volatility of these commodities 
to some extent  however  we are able to mitigate this risk through a long term hedging strategy that is intended to generate more stable realized prices by using derivative contracts as hedges to the exposure of fluctuating expected future cash flows produced by changes in commodity sales prices 
nonetheless  decreases in the prices of crude oil and natural gas liquids will have a negative impact on the results of our co segment  and we have exposure on all unhedged sales volumes  the majority of which are natural gas liquids volumes 
had we not used energy derivative contracts to transfer commodity price risk  our crude oil sales prices would have averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in the million decrease in the segment s sales and transportation earnings for versus was due primarily to the million drop in revenues  which included both a million decrease in carbon dioxide sales revenues and a million decrease in carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues 
the decrease from carbon dioxide sales revenues was entirely price related  as the segment s average price received from carbon dioxide sales in decreased compared to last year  reducing revenues by million 
the decrease in carbon dioxide sales revenues resulting from the unfavorable price change more than offset a million increase in sales revenues resulting from higher sales volumes  which increased in  primarily due to carbon dioxide expansion projects completed since the end of  and to a continued strong demand for carbon dioxide from tertiary oil recovery projects 
although we purchase certain volumes of carbon dioxide on an intercompany basis for use  we do not recognize profits on carbon dioxide sales to ourselves 

table of contents the overall decrease in carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues in versus was mainly due to lower carbon dioxide transportation revenues from our central basin pipeline and to lower crude oil transportation revenues from our wink pipeline 
although its deliveries of carbon dioxide volumes increased in and combined segment delivery volumes increased central basin s revenues were negatively impacted by lower weighted average transportation rates  due partly to the fact that a portion of its carbon dioxide transportation contracts were indexed to lower oil prices in  when compared to last year 
the decrease in delivery revenues from our wink crude oil pipeline was primarily due to lower pipeline loss allowance revenues in  resulting from lower market prices for crude oil relative to last year 
the segment s overall million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in  when compared to  was driven almost evenly by higher earnings from its carbon dioxide sales and transportation activities and its oil and gas producing activities 
the earnings increase was largely revenue related  driven by increased crude oil  carbon dioxide  and natural gas liquids sales revenues  due primarily to increases in average crude oil which also impacts the price of carbon dioxide and natural gas plant product prices during the first three quarters of the year over year increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from the segment s sales and transportation activities in was driven by an million increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues and a million increase in carbon dioxide and crude oil pipeline transportation revenues 
the increase in carbon dioxide sales revenues was due to both a increase in average sales prices and a increase in average sales volumes  when compared to the increase in total pipeline transportation revenues was chiefly due to a increase in carbon dioxide delivery volumes in  relative to the prior year 
the increase in average carbon dioxide sales prices in versus was due both to continued customer demand for carbon dioxide for use in oil recovery projects throughout the permian basin area in and to the positive impact on the portion of our carbon dioxide sales contracts that are tied to crude oil prices  which increased since the end of the increases in carbon dioxide sales and delivery volumes were largely due to the january  start up of the doe canyon carbon dioxide source field located in dolores county  colorado 
we hold an approximately working interest in doe canyon and since mid year  we invested approximately million to develop this source field 
in addition  investments were also made to drill additional carbon dioxide wells at the mcelmo dome unit  increase transportation capacity on the cortez pipeline  and extend the cortez pipeline to the new doe canyon deep unit 
the year over year increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization from the segment s oil and gas producing activities in was also driven by higher revenues and generally  our oil and gas related revenues are closely aligned with our realized price levels for crude oil and natural gas liquids products 
revenues from crude oil sales and natural gas plant products sales increased million and million  respectively  in compared to  driven by increases of and  respectively  in the realized weighted average price per barrel 
compared to the previous year  crude oil sales volumes increased in  but natural gas liquids sales volumes dropped  due primarily to the effects from hurricane ike  and in part to operational issues on a third party owned pipeline which resulted in pro rationing production allocation 
hurricane ike  which made landfall at galveston  texas  on september   temporarily shut down third party fractionation facilities  which caused a decline in liquids production volumes in and around the permian basin area through the end of november for more information on our ownership interests in the net quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and our measures of discounted future net cash flows from oil and gas reserves  please see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

the segment s remaining million increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to  and its remaining million increase in compared to  were driven by a combination of internal asset growth and strategic business acquisitions 
we have made and continue to seek terminal acquisitions in order to gain access to new markets and to complement and or enlarge our existing terminal operations and since the beginning of  we have invested approximately million in cash to acquire both terminal assets and equity interests in terminal operations

the terminal also recognized a million property casualty gain on a vessel dock that was damaged in march in the second quarter of the increase in earnings from our gulf coast terminals reflects favorable results from our two large liquids terminal facilities located along the houston ship channel in pasadena and galena park  texas 
the earnings increase was driven by higher liquids warehousing revenues  mainly due to new and incremental customer agreements at higher rates and to additional storage capacity  and also to additional ancillary terminal services 
combined  our pasadena and galena park terminals brought an incremental million barrels of liquids tankage capacity online during including incremental truck loading capacity 
for all terminals combined  total liquids throughput volumes were higher than  primarily due to both completed expansion projects and to continued strong demand for distillate and ethanol volumes 
expansion projects completed since the end of increased our liquids terminals leasable capacity to million barrels  up from a capacity of million barrels at the end of at the same time  our overall liquids utilization capacity rate the ratio of our actual leased capacity to our estimated potential capacity decreased by only since the end of the increase in earnings in from our west region terminals was driven by incremental contributions from our kinder morgan north terminal  the crude oil tank farm we constructed near edmonton  alberta  canada  and from our vancouver wharves bulk marine terminal  located on the north shore of vancouver  british columbia  canada s main harbor 
we completed construction and placed our north terminal into service in the second quarter of the increase in earnings from our vancouver wharves terminal was chiefly due to higher liquids revenues  due in part to expanded liquids facilities that began operating in april  and to continued strong ship traffic during at the port metro vancouver 

table of contents the increase in earnings from our texas petroleum coke operations was chiefly due to higher earnings realized from our port of houston  port of beaumont and houston refining operations 
the combined earnings increase from these operations was driven by higher petroleum coke throughput and production volumes and higher handling rates in the higher volumes in was due in part to a new petroleum coke customer contract that boosted volume at our port of houston bulk facility  and in part to the negative impacts caused by hurricane ike in the third quarter of the overall increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in compared to from terminals owned in both comparable years was partly offset by lower earnings from our mid river  ohio valley and materials management terminals 
the decrease in earnings from these facilities was due primarily to decreased import export activity  and to lower business activity at various owned and or operated rail and terminal sites that are primarily involved in the handling and storage of steel and alloy products 
due to the economic downturn that intensified in the last half of  we experienced significant year over year volume and revenue declines at various owned or operated terminal facilities in  when compared to for our terminals segment combined  bulk traffic tonnage decreased by million tons in versus and relatedly  revenues from terminals owned in both years decreased by million 
however  while the overall volume and revenue declines in have generally been broad based across all of our bulk terminals  the rate of decline has slowed bulk tonnage decreased in the first half of compared to the first half of and since the start of the year the segment has taken actions to manage costs and increase productivity 
for all terminals owned in both years  combined operating expenses decreased million in versus in addition to the effects from the declines in bulk tonnage volumes described above  the expense reductions were generated by a combination of aggressive cost management actions related to operating expenses  certain productivity initiatives at various terminal sites  and year over year declines in commodity and fuel costs

the increase was due mainly to higher liquids throughput volumes and increased liquids storage capacity as a result of terminal expansions completed since the end of the increase in earnings from our mid atlantic terminals was driven by higher earnings and revenues from our pier ix bulk terminal  located in newport news  virginia  and our fairless hills  pennsylvania bulk terminal 
the increase from pier ix was mainly due to higher year over year coal transfer volumes in  due largely to an almost million capital improvement project  completed in the first quarter of  that involved the construction of a new ship dock and the installation of additional terminal equipment 
the increase from our fairless hills terminal was largely due to incremental earnings from a new import fertilizer facility that began operations in the second quarter of the import fertilizer facility cost approximately million to build  and included the construction of two storage domes  conveying equipment  and outbound loading facilities for both rail and truck 
the increase in earnings in compared to from our northeast terminals was largely due to higher earnings from our new york harbor liquids terminals  which include our perth amboy  new jersey terminal  our carteret  new jersey terminal  and our staten island  new york terminal 
the year over year increase in earnings from these terminals was driven by a combined increase in liquids throughput volumes resulting both from incremental business driven by strong demand for imported fuel and from tank expansions completed since the end of  higher transfer and storage rates  and incremental revenues from ancillary terminal services

the increase in earnings from trans mountain in was driven by both higher pipeline transportation revenues and higher net currency gains included within other  net income  and partially offset by higher year over year income tax expenses and lower income from allowances for capital funds used for pipeline system construction costs 
in  trans mountain s operating revenues increased million compared to  driven by an increase in mainline delivery volumes resulting from both a significant increase in ship traffic during at the port metro vancouver and the completion of the trans mountain pipeline anchor loop expansion project in october the overall million decrease in earnings from our express and jet fuel operations for the same comparable periods in and was driven by a million decrease in equity earnings from our ownership interest in the express pipeline system in the decrease was due to lower year over year revenues  higher power expenses and higher income tax expenses in the express operating companies  when compared to the same periods in when comparing the segment s operating results for with  the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above accounted for an increase in earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization of million 
the remaining million increase in segment earnings before depreciation  depletion and amortization in versus consisted of higher earnings of million from the trans mountain pipeline assets we owned in the same periods in both years may through december  and incremental earnings of million from periods we owned assets in only trans mountain for the period january through april  and express and jet fuel for the period september through december 

table of contents the increase in earnings from trans mountain during the same periods in both and was driven primarily by higher operating revenues  due largely to the completion of the trans mountain pipeline anchor loop expansion project 
the anchor loop project boosted pipeline capacity from  to  barrels per day and resulted in higher period to period average toll rates 
the higher tariffs became effective in june  and more than offset an decline in mainline throughput volumes in  which resulted primarily from lower demand for water borne exports out of vancouver  british columbia

amount includes a million increase in expense related to imputed interest on our cochin pipeline acquisition  and a million expense for trans mountain expenses for periods prior to our acquisition date of april  c  and amounts include decreases of million  million and million  respectively  in net income attributable to our noncontrolling interests  related to the effect from all of the  and items previously disclosed in the footnotes to the tables included in results of operations 
items not attributable to any segment include general and administrative expenses  unallocable interest income and income tax expense  interest expense  and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
our general and administrative expenses include such items as salaries and employee related expenses  payroll taxes  insurance  office supplies and rentals  unallocated litigation and environmental expenses  and shared corporate services including accounting  information technology  human resources and legal services 
we report our interest expense as net  meaning that we have subtracted unallocated interest income from our total interest expense to arrive at one interest amount 

table of contents combined  the certain items described in the footnotes to the table above increased our general and administrative expenses million in  million in  and million in  and after taking into effect these certain items  our general and administrative expenses increased million and million  respectively  in and  when compared to the respective prior year 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses in versus included a combined million increase due to higher employee benefits and payroll tax expenses in  and a million increase due to a drop in capitalized overhead expenses other than benefits and payroll taxes  relative to the increase in benefits and payroll taxes was due mainly to cost inflation increases on work based health and insurance benefits  lower returns on our pension plan assets  higher wage rates in  and a larger year over year labor force 
the increase due to lower capitalized expenses was due in part to lower overall spending on capital projects in versus  and to fewer overhead expenses meeting the criteria for capitalization 
the overall increase in general and administrative expenses in versus was driven by a million increase in employee benefits and payroll tax expenses and a million increase from incremental expenses and higher corporate overhead associated with the trans mountain  express one third interest and jet fuel pipeline systems we acquired from kmi since the beginning of the increases in benefits and payroll taxes were primarily due to our larger asset base in  including increases associated with the acquired bulk and liquids terminal operations that are described above in terminals 
after taking into effect the certain items described in footnote b to the table above  our unallocable interest expense  net of interest income and capitalized interest  increased million in compared to  and increased million compared to for both comparable periods  the increase in interest expense was attributable to higher average borrowings  and partly offset by lower effective interest rates 
our average debt balances increased in and in  when compared to the respective prior years 
the increases in average borrowings were largely due to the capital expenditures  joint venture contributions  and external business acquisitions we have made since the beginning of generally  we initially fund both our discretionary capital spending including payments for asset expansion and improvement projects  including additional pipeline construction costs and our acquisition outlays from borrowings under our long term revolving bank credit facility 
from time to time  we issue senior notes and equity in order to refinance our credit facility borrowings 
for more information on our capital expansion and acquisition expenditures  see liquidity and capital resources investing activities 
the overall year over year increases in interest expense in both and were partially offset by decreases in expense resulting from lower average interest rates in both years  when compared to the respective prior years  due primarily to a general drop in variable interest rates since the beginning of  including decreases in the variable interest rate we paid on the borrowings made under our revolving bank credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings decreased in compared to  and decreased in compared to we use interest rate swap agreements to transform a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities senior notes into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt  and in periods of falling interest rates  these swaps result in period to period decreases in our interest expense 
as of december   approximately of our  million consolidated debt balance excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements was subject to variable interest rates either as short term or long term variable rate debt obligations or as fixed rate debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps 
as of december   approximately of our  million consolidated debt balance excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements was subject to variable interest rates 
for more information on our interest rate swaps  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
unallocable income tax expenses relate to corporate income tax accruals for the texas margin tax  an entity level tax initiated january  and imposed on the amount of our total revenue that is apportioned to the state of texas 
both the decrease in expense  in  and the increase in expense  in  was due to higher margin tax expense accruals in  relative to both and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests  which represents the allocation of our consolidated net income attributable to all outstanding ownership interests in our operating limited partnerships and their consolidated subsidiaries that are not held by us  increased in both and  when compared to the respective prior years 
the increases in income attributable to our noncontrolling interests were due to our higher overall net income in each succeeding year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we believe our balance sheet and liquidity position remained strong 
we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and we had approximately billion of borrowing capacity available under our billion senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility discussed below in short term liquidity 
we have consistently generated strong cash flows from operations generating billion and billion in cash from operations for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and we demonstrated continued access to the equity market by raising billion in cash from the public offering of additional common units in our primary cash requirements  in addition to normal operating expenses  are for debt service  sustaining capital expenditures defined as capital expenditures which do not increase the capacity of an asset  expansion capital expenditures and quarterly distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholder and general partner 
in general  we expect to fund cash distributions and sustaining capital expenditures with existing cash and cash flows from operating activities  expansion capital expenditures and working capital deficits with retained cash resulting from including i units in the determination of cash distributions per unit but paying quarterly distributions on i units in additional i units rather than cash  additional borrowings  and the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr  interest payments with cash flows from operating activities  and debt principal payments with additional borrowings  as such debt principal payments become due  or by the issuance of additional common units or the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr 
in addition to our results of operations  our debt and capital balances are affected by our financing activities  as discussed below in financing activities 
as described under items and business and properties environmental matters climate change  passage of any climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives that regulate or restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could increase our costs related to operating and maintaining our facilities and require us to install new emission controls on our facilities  acquire allowances for our greenhouse gas emissions  pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program 
we are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs  however  they could be significant 
credit ratings and capital market liquidity as part of our financial strategy  we try to maintain an investment grade credit rating  which involves  among other things  the issuance of additional limited partner units in connection with our acquisitions and expansion activities in order to maintain acceptable financial ratios 
currently  our long term corporate debt credit rating is bbb  baa and bbb  respectively  at standard poor s rating services  moody s investor services inc and fitch inc 
as a publicly traded limited partnership  our common units are attractive primarily to individual investors  although such investors represent a small segment of the total equity capital market 
we believe that some institutional investors prefer shares of kmr over our common units due to tax and other regulatory considerations  and we are able to access this segment of the capital market through kmr s purchases of i units issued by us with the proceeds from the sale of kmr shares to institutional investors 
on september   lehman brothers holdings inc filed for bankruptcy protection under the provisions of chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
lehman brothers commercial bank was a lending institution that provided million of the commitments under our billion senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility 
during the first quarter of  we amended our facility to remove lehman brothers commercial bank as a lender  thus reducing the facility by million see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the commitments of the other banks remain unchanged  and the facility is not defaulted 
on october   standard poor s rating services revised its outlook on our long term credit rating to negative from stable but affirmed our long term credit rating at bbb  due to our previously announced expected delay and cost increases associated with the completion of the rockies express pipeline project 
at the same time  standard poor s lowered our short term credit rating to a from a as a result of this revision to our short term credit rating and the current commercial paper market conditions  we are unable to access commercial paper borrowings 
on may   moody s investors service downgraded our commercial paper rating to prime from prime and assigned a negative outlook to our long term credit rating 
the downgrade and negative outlook were primarily related to the increases  since the beginning of  in our outstanding debt balance 
however  we continue to maintain an investment grade credit rating  and all of our long term credit ratings remain unchanged since december  furthermore  we expect that our financing and our short term liquidity needs will continue to be met through borrowings made under our bank credit facility 
nevertheless  our ability to satisfy our financing requirements or fund our planned capital expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the energy and terminals industries and other financial and business factors  some of which are beyond our control 

table of contents additionally  some of our customers are experiencing  or may experience in the future  severe financial problems that have had or may have a significant impact on their creditworthiness 
these financial problems may arise from the current financial crises  changes in commodity prices or otherwise 
we have and are working to implement  to the extent allowable under applicable contracts  tariffs and regulations  prepayments and other security requirements  such as letters of credit  to enhance our credit position relating to amounts owed from these customers 
we cannot provide assurance that one or more of our current or future financially distressed customers will not default on their obligations to us or that such a default or defaults will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  future results of operations  or future cash flows  however  we believe we have provided adequate allowance for such customers 
short term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are our i billion senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility that matures august   and ii cash from operations discussed below in operating activities 
borrowings under our bank credit facility can be used for general partnership purposes and as a backup for our commercial paper program 
the facility can be amended to allow for borrowings of up to billion after reductions for the lending commitments made by lehman brothers commercial bank  which were canceled in connection with the lehman brothers bankruptcy and discussed above in credit ratings and capital market liquidity 
we plan to negotiate a renewal of our credit facility before its maturity date 
our outstanding short term debt as of december  was million  primarily consisting of million in outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility and million in principal amount of senior notes that mature on november  as discussed above in credit ratings and capital market liquidity  there were no borrowings under our commercial paper program 
as of december   our outstanding short term debt was million  primarily consisting of a million principal amount of senior notes that matured and was paid on february  we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility or our commercial paper program as of december  we provide for additional liquidity by maintaining a sizable amount of excess borrowing capacity related to our bank credit facility 
after reduction for i our letters of credit  ii our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility  and iii the lending commitments made by lehman brothers commercial bank  the remaining available borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility was  million as of december  this remaining borrowing capacity allows us to manage our day to day cash requirements and any anticipated obligations and currently  we believe our liquidity to be adequate 
working capital current assets minus current liabilities can also be used to measure how much in liquid assets a company has available to build its business  and we had working capital deficits of million as of december  and million as of december  the unfavorable change from year end was primarily due to our incremental million bank credit facility borrowings as of december  generally  our working capital balance varies due to factors such as the timing of scheduled debt payments  timing differences in the collection and payment of receivables and payables  the change in fair value of our derivative contracts and changes in cash and cash equivalent balances as a result of debt or equity issuances discussed below in long term financing 
as a result  our working capital balance could return to a surplus in future periods 
a working capital deficit is not unusual for us or for other companies similar in size and scope to us  and we believe that our working capital deficit does not indicate a lack of liquidity as we continue to maintain adequate current assets to satisfy current liabilities and maturing obligations when they come due 
we employ a centralized cash management program for our us based bank acounts that essentially concentrates the cash assets of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries in joint accounts for the purpose of providing financial flexibility and lowering the cost of borrowing 
our centralized cash management program provides that funds in excess of the daily needs of our operating partnerships and their subsidiaries are concentrated  consolidated  or otherwise made available for use by other entities within our consolidated group 
we place no material restrictions on the ability to move cash between entities  payment of intercompany balances or the ability to upstream dividends to parent companies other than restrictions that may be contained in agreements governing the indebtedness of those entities 
however  our cash and the cash of our subsidiaries is not concentrated into accounts of kmi or any company not in our consolidated group of companies  and kmi has no rights with respect to our cash except as permitted pursuant to our partnership agreement 

table of contents furthermore  certain of our operating subsidiaries are subject to ferc enacted reporting requirements for oil and natural gas pipeline companies that participate in cash management programs 
ferc regulated entities subject to these rules must  among other things  place their cash management agreements in writing  maintain current copies of the documents authorizing and supporting their cash management agreements  and file documentation establishing the cash management program with the ferc 
long term financing in addition to our principal sources of short term liquidity listed above  we could meet our cash requirements other than distributions to our common unitholders  class b unitholders and general partner through issuing long term notes or additional common units  or by utilizing the proceeds from purchases of additional i units by kmr with the proceeds from issuances of kmr shares 
our equity offerings consist of the issuance of additional common units or the issuance of additional i units to kmr which kmr purchases with the proceeds from the sale of additional kmr shares to institutional investors 
from time to time we issue long term debt securities  often referred to as our senior notes 
all of our senior notes issued to date  other than those issued under our long term revolving credit facility or those issued by our subsidiaries and operating partnerships  generally have the same terms except for interest rates  maturity dates and prepayment premiums 
all of our outstanding senior notes are unsecured obligations that rank equally with all of our other senior debt obligations  however  a modest amount of secured debt has been incurred by some of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries 
our fixed rate senior notes provide that we may redeem the notes at any time at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date plus a make whole premium 
we are subject  however  to conditions in the equity and debt markets for our limited partner units and long term senior notes  and there can be no assurance we will be able or willing to access the public or private markets for our limited partner units and or long term senior notes in the future 
if we were unable or unwilling to issue additional limited partner units  we would be required to either restrict potential future acquisitions or pursue debt financing alternatives  some of which could involve higher costs or negatively affect our credit ratings 
furthermore  our ability to access the public and private debt markets is affected by our credit ratings 
see credit ratings and capital market liquidity above for a discussion of our credit ratings 
as of december  and december   the total liability balance due on the various series of our senior notes was  million and  million  respectively  and the total liability balance due on the various borrowings of our operating partnerships and subsidiaries was million and million  respectively

for information on our and equity issuances  including cash proceeds received from both public offerings of common units and our equity distribution agreement  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
capital structure we attempt to maintain a relatively conservative overall capital structure  financing our expansion capital expenditures and acquisitions with approximately equity and debt 
in the short term  we fund these expenditures from borrowings under our credit facility until the amount borrowed is of a sufficient size to cost effectively offer either debt  or equity  or both 
with respect to our debt  we target a debt mixture of approximately fixed and variable interest rates 
we achieve our variable rate exposure primarily by issuing long term fixed rate debt and then swapping the fixed rate interest payments for variable rate payments 

table of contents capital expenditures our sustaining capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million including approximately million for our proportionate share of rockies express sustaining capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   our sustaining capital expenditures totaled million including approximately million for our proportionate share of rockies express sustaining capital expenditures 
our forecasted expenditures for for sustaining capital expenditures are approximately million including million for our proportionate shares of rockies express and midcontinent express 
generally  we fund our sustaining capital expenditures with our cash flows from operations 
in addition to utilizing cash generated from their own operations  rockies express and midcontinent express can each fund their own cash requirements for capital expenditures through borrowings under their own credit facility  issuing their own long term notes  or with proceeds from contributions received from their equity owners 
all of our capital expenditures  with the exception of sustaining capital expenditures  are discretionary 
the discretionary capital expenditures reflected in our consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december  and  were  million and  million  respectively 
the year to year decrease in discretionary capital expenditures in versus was mainly due to higher capital expenditures made during on our major natural gas pipeline projects and on our trans mountain crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline system 
we forecast million for discretionary capital expenditures in our budget 
in addition to our discretionary capital expenditures  we contributed a combined  million in to the rockies express  midcontinent express and fayetteville express natural gas pipeline projects all three reported as investments on our balance sheet and accounted for under the equity method of accounting  primarily to fund our proportionate share of both construction and or pre construction costs  and the repayment of senior notes by rockies express in august generally  we fund our discretionary capital expenditures and our investment contributions through borrowings under our bank credit facility 
to the extent this source of funding is not sufficient  we generally fund additional amounts through the issuance of long term notes or common units for cash 
during  we used sales of common units and the issuance of senior notes to refinance portions of our short term borrowings under our bank credit facility 
capital requirements for recent transactions for the years ended december  and  our net cash outlays for the acquisition of assets and investments totaled million in versus million in including the million cash contribution we received in april from kmi as a result of a certain true up provision in our trans mountain acquisition agreement

in  we terminated two fixed to variable interest rate swap agreements having a combined notional principal amount of million  and we received an aggregate amount of million for the terminations of these swap agreements  a million increase in cash from overall higher net income after adjusting for depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses 
the year to year increase in income before depreciation  depletion and amortization from our five reportable business segments in compared to is discussed above in results of operations including all of the certain items disclosed in the associated table footnotes  a million increase in cash inflows related to year to year changes in both non current assets and liabilities and other non cash expenses  primarily driven by a million noncash expense associated with adjustments to long term receivables for environmental cost recoveries recognized in the fourth quarter of  and a million increase in cash received from equity investments distributions less earnings from equity investments in chiefly due to incremental distributions received from rockies express pipeline llc 
the additional distributions were mainly due to the incremental earnings attributable to both the rockies express east natural gas pipeline segment  which began initial pipeline service in june  and the rockies express west segment  which began full operations in may investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in the prior year 
the million overall increase in cash utilized in investing activities was primarily attributable to the following a  million increase in cash used due to higher net contributions to equity investments contributions  net of distributions in excess of cumulative earnings in primarily driven by incremental contributions to rockies express pipeline llc  midcontinent express pipeline llc  and fayetteville pipeline llc to partially fund their respective rockies express  midcontinent express  and fayetteville express pipeline construction and or pre construction costs  and the repayment of senior notes by rockies express in august combined  we contributed  million in to partially fund our proportionate share of these three pipeline projects  and in  we contributed a combined million

table of contents similarly  in february  midcontinent express pipeline llc entered into and then made borrowings under a new billion three year  unsecured revolving credit facility due february  midcontinent then made distributions in excess of cumulative earnings to its two member owners to reimburse them for prior contributions made to fund its pipeline construction costs 
our proportionate share of these distributions was million  a million increase in cash used for the acquisition of assets and investments  when compared to the increase was driven by the million we paid to acquire the natural gas treating business from crosstex energy lp and crosstex energy  inc effective october   and the million we paid to acquire a membership interest in endeavor gathering llc effective november   an million increase in cash used primarily due to the return of margin deposits in  which was posted in a prior period 
we deposit margin money with our counterparties in order to maintain certain energy commodity hedging positions  and our margin deposits are associated largely with our utilization of derivative contracts to hedge offset against the volatility of energy commodity price risks

table of contents a million decrease in cash due to higher partnership distributions paid in  when compared to distributions paid in distributions to all partners  consisting of our common and class b unitholders  our general partner and noncontrolling interests  totaled  million in  compared to  million last year 
the increase in distributions to all partners was due to an increase in the per unit cash distributions paid  an increase in the number of units outstanding  and an increase in our general partner incentive distributions 
the increase in our general partner incentive distributions resulted from both increased cash distributions per unit and an increase in the number of common units and i units outstanding  and a million decrease in cash from net changes in cash book overdrafts resulting from timing differences on checks issued but not yet presented for payment 
partnership distributions our partnership agreement requires that we distribute of available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement  to our partners within days following the end of each calendar quarter in accordance with their respective percentage interests 
available cash consists generally of all of our cash receipts  including cash received by our operating partnerships and net reductions in reserves  less cash disbursements and net additions to reserves and amounts payable to the former general partner of sfpp  lp in respect of its remaining interest in sfpp 
our general partner is granted discretion by our partnership agreement  which discretion has been delegated to kmr  subject to the approval of our general partner in certain cases  to establish  maintain and adjust reserves for the proper conduct of our business  which might include reserves for matters such as future operating expenses  debt service  sustaining capital expenditures and rate refunds  and for distributions for the next four quarters 
these reserves are not restricted by magnitude  but only by type of future cash requirements with which they can be associated 
when kmr determines our quarterly distributions  it considers current and expected reserve needs along with current and expected cash flows to identify the appropriate sustainable distribution level 
for  and  we distributed approximately   and  respectively  of the total of cash receipts less cash disbursements calculations assume that kmr unitholders received cash instead of additional i units 
the difference between these numbers and of distributable cash flow reflects net changes in reserves 
our general partner and owners of our common units and class b units receive distributions in cash  while kmr  the sole owner of our i units  receives distributions in additional i units 
we do not distribute cash to i unit owners but instead retain the cash for use in our business 
however  the cash equivalent of distributions of i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to our general partner 
each time we make a distribution  the number of i units owned by kmr and the percentage of our total units owned by kmr increase automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement 
pursuant to our partnership agreement  distributions to unitholders are characterized either as distributions of cash from operations or as distributions of cash from interim capital transactions 
this distinction affects the distributions to owners of common units  class b units and i units relative to the distributions to our general partner 
cash from operations 
cash from operations generally refers to our cash balance on the date we commenced operations  plus all cash generated by the operation of our business  after deducting related cash expenditures  net additions to or reductions in reserves  debt service and various other items 
cash from interim capital transactions 
cash from interim capital transactions will generally result only from distributions that are funded from borrowings  sales of debt and equity securities and sales or other dispositions of assets for cash  other than inventory  accounts receivable and other current assets and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business 
rule for characterizing distributions 
all available cash distributed by us from any source will be treated as distributions of cash from operations until the sum of all available cash distributed equals the cumulative amount of cash from operations actually generated from the date we commenced operations through the end of the calendar quarter prior to that distribution 
any distribution of available cash which  when added to the sum of all prior distributions  is in excess of the cumulative amount of cash from operations  will be considered a distribution of cash from interim capital transactions until the initial common unit price is fully recovered as described under allocation of distributions from interim capital transactions 
for purposes of calculating the sum of all distributions of available cash  the total equivalent cash amount of all distributions of i units to kmr  as the holder of all i units  will be treated as distributions of available cash  even though the distributions to kmr are made in additional i units rather than cash 
we retain this cash and use it in our business 
to date  all our cash distributions have been treated as distributions of cash from operations 
allocation of distributions from operations 
cash from operations for each quarter will be distributed effectively as follows first  to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  second  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  third  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata and to our general partner until the owners of all classes of units have received a total of per unit in cash or equivalent i units for such quarter  and fourth  of any available cash then remaining to the owners of all classes of units pro rata  to owners of common units and class b units in cash and to owners of i units in the equivalent number of i units  and to our general partner 
incentive distributions are generally defined as all cash distributions paid to our general partner that are in excess of of the aggregate value of cash and i units being distributed 
our general partner s incentive distribution that we declared for and was million and million  respectively  while the incentive distribution paid to our general partner during and was million and million  respectively 
the difference between declared and paid distributions is due to the fact that our distributions for the fourth quarter of each year are declared and paid in the first quarter of the following year 

table of contents on february   we paid a quarterly distribution of per unit for the fourth quarter of this distribution matched the distribution per unit we paid for the fourth quarter of we paid this distribution in cash to our common unitholders and to our class b unitholders 
kmr  our sole i unitholder  received additional i units based on the cash distribution per common unit 
we believe that future operating results will continue to support similar levels of quarterly cash and i unit distributions  however  no assurance can be given that future distributions will continue at such levels 
allocation of distributions from interim capital transactions 
any distribution by us of available cash that would constitute cash from interim capital transactions would be distributed effectively as follows to all owners of common units and class b units pro rata in cash and to the holders of i units in equivalent i units  and to our general partner  until we have distributed cash from this source in respect of a common unit outstanding since our original public offering in an aggregate amount per unit equal to the initial common unit price of  as adjusted for splits 
as cash from interim capital transactions is distributed  it would be treated as if it were a repayment of the initial public offering price of the common units 
to reflect that repayment  the first three distribution levels of cash from operations would be adjusted downward proportionately by multiplying each distribution level amount by a fraction  the numerator of which is the unrecovered initial common unit price immediately after giving effect to that distribution and the denominator of which is the unrecovered initial common unit price immediately prior to giving effect to that distribution 
for example  assuming the unrecovered initial common unit price is per common unit and if cash from the first interim capital transaction of per unit was distributed to owners of common units  then the amount of the first three distribution levels would each be reduced to of its then current level 
the unrecovered initial common unit price generally is the amount by which the initial common unit price exceeds the aggregate distribution of cash from interim capital transactions per common unit 
when the initial common unit price is fully recovered  then each of the first three distribution levels will have been reduced to zero 
thereafter all distributions of available cash from all sources will be treated as if they were cash from operations and available cash will be distributed to all classes of units pro rata with the distribution to i units being made instead in the form of i units and to our general partner

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk generally  our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be other than trading 
our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions 

table of contents energy commodity market risk we are exposed to energy commodity market risk and other external risks  such as weather related risk  in the ordinary course of business 
however  we take steps to hedge  or limit our exposure to  these risks in order to maintain a more stable and predictable earnings stream 
stated another way  we execute a hedging strategy that seeks to protect us financially against adverse price movements and serves to minimize potential losses 
our strategy involves the use of certain energy commodity derivative contracts to reduce and minimize the risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
the derivative contracts we use include energy products traded on the new york mercantile exchange and over the counter markets  including  but not limited to  futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps and basis swaps 
fundamentally  our hedging strategy involves taking a simultaneous position in the futures market that is equal and opposite to our position  or anticipated position  in the cash market or physical product in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change 
for example  as sellers of crude oil and natural gas  we often enter into fixed price swaps and or futures contracts to guarantee or lock in the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery  thereby directly offsetting any change in prices  either positive or negative 
a hedge is successful when gains or losses in the cash market are neutralized by losses or gains in the futures transaction 
our policies require that we only enter into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors  and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties credit ratings 
while we enter into derivative transactions only with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings  it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future 
the credit ratings of the primary parties from whom we transact in energy commodity derivative contracts based on contract market values are as follows credit ratings per standard poor s rating services credit rating j 
aron company goldman sachs a morgan stanley a bnp paribas aa as discussed above  our principal use of energy commodity derivative contracts is to mitigate the market price risk associated with anticipated transactions for the purchase and sale of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil 
using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide us increased certainty with regard to our operating cash flows and helps us undertake further capital improvement projects  attain budget results and meet distribution targets to our partners 
we categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain 
cash flow hedges are defined as hedges made with the intention of decreasing the variability in cash flows related to future transactions  as opposed to the value of an asset  liability or firm commitment  and we are allowed special hedge accounting treatment for such derivative contracts 
in accounting for cash flow hedges  gains and losses on the derivative contracts are reported in other comprehensive income  outside net income reported in our consolidated statements of income  but only to the extent that the gains and losses from the change in value of the derivative contracts can later offset the loss or gain from the change in value of the hedged future cash flows during the period in which the hedged cash flows affect net income 
that is  for cash flow hedges  all effective components of the derivative contracts gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss  pending occurrence of the expected transaction 
other comprehensive income loss consists of those financial items that are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets but not included in our net income 
thus  in highly effective cash flow hedges  where there is no ineffectiveness  other comprehensive income changes by exactly as much as the derivative contracts and there is no impact on earnings until the expected transaction occurs 
all remaining gains and losses on the derivative contracts the ineffective portion are included in current net income 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts is the difference between the gain or loss from the change in value of the derivative contract and the effective portion of that gain or loss 
in addition  when the hedged forecasted transaction does take place and affects earnings  the effective part of the hedge is also recognized in the income statement  and the earlier recognized effective amounts are removed from accumulated other comprehensive loss 
if the forecasted transaction results in an asset or liability  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss should be reclassified into earnings when the asset or liability affects earnings through cost of sales  depreciation  interest expense  etc 

table of contents the accumulated components of other comprehensive income are reported separately as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet 
for us  the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets primarily include i the effective portion of the gains and losses on cash flow hedging derivatives which are primarily related to the derivative contracts associated with our hedging of anticipated future cash flows from the sales and purchases of natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil and ii foreign currency translation adjustments which result from translating all of our foreign denominated assets and liabilities at current exchange rates  while equity is translated by using historical or weighted average exchange rates 
the total accumulated other comprehensive loss balance included within the partners capital section of our accompanying balance sheets as of december  included both a cumulative debit amount unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging derivatives of million and a cumulative credit amount unrealized gain associated with foreign currency translation of million 
the total accumulated other comprehensive loss included within the partners capital section of our accompanying balance sheets as of december  included a cumulative debit amount unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging derivatives of million and a cumulative debit amount unrealized loss of million from foreign currency translation adjustments 
in future periods  as the hedged cash flows from our actual purchases and sales of energy commodities affect our net income  the related gains and losses included in our accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of our hedging are transferred to the income statement as well  effectively offsetting the changes in cash flows stemming from the hedged risk 
we measure the risk of price changes in the natural gas  natural gas liquids and crude oil markets utilizing a value at risk model 
value at risk is a statistical measure estimating the probability of portfolio losses over a given holding period  within a certain level of statistical confidence 
we utilize a closed form model to evaluate risk on a quarterly basis 
the value at risk computations utilize a confidence level of for the resultant price movement and a holding period of one day is chosen for the calculation 
the confidence level used means that there is a probability that the mark to market losses for a single day will not exceed the value at risk number presented 
for each of the years ended december  and  our value at risk reached a high of million and million  respectively  and a low of million and million  respectively 
value at risk as of december  was million  and averaged million for value at risk as of december  was million  and averaged million for the increase in value at risk during largely results from our increased use of options to hedge crude oil production 
our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of the reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our combined portfolio of derivative contracts including commodity futures and options contracts  fixed price swaps  basis swaps and over the counter options and corresponding physical commodities assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates  and is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated 
actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year 
in addition  as discussed above  we enter into these derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities and  therefore both in the value at risk calculation and in reality  the change in the market value of our portfolio of derivative contracts is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions 
for more information on our risk management activities  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
interest rate risk in order to maintain a cost effective capital structure  it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
the market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
generally  we do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 

table of contents as of december  and  the carrying values of our fixed rate debt were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
these amounts compare to  as of december  and  fair values of  million and  million  respectively 
fair values were determined using quoted market prices  where applicable  or future cash flow discounted at market rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
a hypothetical change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt for and  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair values of these instruments 
the carrying value and fair value of our variable rate debt  including associated accrued interest and excluding the value of interest rate swap agreements discussed below  was million as of december  and million as of december  a hypothetical change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings approximately basis points in  when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december  and  including adjustments for notional swap amounts  would result in changes of approximately million and million  respectively  in our and annual pre tax earnings 
as of december  and  we were a party to interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of billion and billion  respectively 
an interest rate swap agreement is a contractual agreement entered into between two counterparties under which each agrees to make periodic interest payments to the other for an agreed period of time based upon a predetermined amount of principal  which is called the notional principal amount 
normally at each payment or settlement date  the party who owes more pays the net amount  so at any given settlement date only one party actually makes a payment 
the principal amount is notional because there is no need to exchange actual amounts of principal 
we entered into our interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of transforming a portion of the underlying cash flows related to our long term fixed rate debt securities into variable rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
since the fair value of our fixed rate debt varies with changes in the market rate of interest  we enter into swap agreements to receive a fixed and pay a variable rate of interest 
such swap agreements result in future cash flows that vary with the market rate of interest  and therefore hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt due to market rate changes 
as of both december  and  all of our interest rate swap agreements represented fixed for variable rate swaps  where we agreed to pay our counterparties a variable rate of interest on a notional principal amount  comprised of principal amounts from various series of our long term fixed rate senior notes 
in exchange  our counterparties agreed to pay us a fixed rate of interest  thereby allowing us to transform our fixed rate liabilities into variable rate obligations without the incurrence of additional loan origination or conversion costs 
we monitor our mix of fixed rate and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or vice versa or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements 
in general  we attempt to maintain an overall target mix of approximately fixed rate debt and variable rate debt 
as of december  and  our cash and investment portfolio included approximately million and million  respectively  in fixed income debt securities 
because our investment in debt securities was made and will be maintained in the future to directly offset the interest rate risk on a like amount of long term debt  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
also  since we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information related to our debt instruments  for more information on our interest rate swap agreements  see note
