on january   we acquired racal acoustics global ltd 
racal acoustics 
racal acoustics develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense and avionics market 
racal acoustics is included in our avionics controls segment 
during fiscal  our income from continuing operations was million or per diluted share compared with million or per diluted share during fiscal  reflecting strong sales and earnings from avionics controls and advanced materials and improved results from sensors systems 
sales and operating earnings of avionics controls increased and  respectively  over fiscal and reflected strong sales and margins of avionics systems  interface technologies systems and communication systems 
only control systems sales and earnings declined against fiscal advanced materials results reflected strong sales and earnings from countermeasures  partially offset by weaker performance from sales of engineered materials 
sensors systems earnings improved over fiscal but are still weak due to the downturn in commercial aviation  particularly business jets 
continuing operations in fiscal were impacted by a foreign currency loss of million relating to the pound sterling denominated funding of racal acoustics 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with for fiscal the lower income tax rate in fiscal primarily reflected the tax benefits associated with the million foreign currency exchange loss and higher r d tax credits 
income from discontinued operations was per diluted share  compared with per diluted share in fiscal  reflecting the gain on sale of psi in september and the sale of muirhead and traxsys in november net income was million or per diluted share  compared with net income of million or per diluted share in fiscal results of continuing operations fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal increased over the prior year 
sales by segment were as follows dollars in thousands increase decrease from prior year avionics controls sensors systems advanced materials total the increase in avionics controls reflected increased sales volumes of avionics systems of million  interface technologies systems of million  and communication systems of million 
the increase in avionics systems principally reflected strong cockpit integration sales volumes 
the increase in interface technologies systems mainly reflected increased sales volumes of input devices for casino gaming and medical applications 
the increased sales of communication systems principally reflected million in incremental sales from the racal acoustics acquisition completed in the first fiscal quarter of these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes of control systems of million  principally cockpit controls for commercial and military applications 
the decrease in sensors systems mainly reflected decreased sales volumes of advanced sensors of million and power systems of million 
the decrease in advanced sensors principally reflected lower oem sales volumes of temperature and pressure sensors due to the downturn in commercial aviation and in particular business jets 
additionally  fiscal benefited from a million retroactive price adjustment and settlement with certain customers 
the decrease in power systems sales was due to the downturn in commercial aviation and was partially offset by a million increase in retrofit sales for commercial aviation 
sales in the first six months of fiscal reflected a stronger pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar and a weaker pound sterling and euro relative to the us dollar during the second six months of the fiscal year 
the increase in sales of advanced materials principally reflected an increase in sales volumes of defense technologies and a decrease in sales of engineered materials 
the increase in sales of defense technologies mainly reflected higher sales volumes of countermeasures of million  principally related to low sales volume in the prior year period due to the delays in the processing of and scheduling shipments of our international customers 
the million decrease in sales of engineered materials reflected lower demand for elastomer materials due to the downturn in commercial aviation and industrial commercial markets 
foreign sales  including export sales by domestic operations  totaled million and million  and accounted for and of our sales in fiscal and  respectively 
overall  gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million compared to million in the prior year period 
about of the increase in segment gross profit was due to strong sales of avionics systems  reflecting increased sales volumes of cockpit integration for the t b military trainer and a military transport cockpit retrofit program 
the remaining increase in segment gross profit reflected strong sales volumes of interface technologies systems and communication systems  partially offset by an million decrease in control systems 
the increase in interface technologies gross profit is due to higher sales volumes of input devices for casino gaming applications and higher sales volumes for medical applications 
the increase in communication systems gross profit mainly reflects incremental gross profit from the acquisition of racal acoustics in the first fiscal quarter of the decrease in gross profit on control systems is mainly due to weaker gross margin of controls for commercial and military applications  as well as higher operating costs from our new control systems facility 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit is principally due to the effect of a decrease in advanced sensors sales volume in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in gross margin 
the increase in gross margin was mainly due to a million inventory write off in fiscal power systems gross profit improved slightly due to retrofits for commercial aviation applications and strong cost control  partially offset by lower sales volumes 
advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
segment gross profit was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  principally reflecting an increase in defense technologies offset by a small decrease in engineered materials 
the increased gross profit on defense technologies reflected a million increase on countermeasures  partially offset by decreased gross profit on combustible ordnance 
the increase in gross profit on countermeasures was principally due to sales volume with additional benefits from improved sales mix and efficiency from longer production runs 
fiscal countermeasures gross profit was impacted by delays in the processing of and scheduling shipments of our international customers 
the decrease in gross profit on engineered materials principally reflected million in costs associated with closing a facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses which include corporate expenses increased to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense principally reflected incremental selling  general and administrative expense from the acquisition of racal acoustics and nmc of million  a million increase in corporate expense mainly due to incentive compensation and professional fees  and the effect of exchange rates on operating expenses at our non us operations of million 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal and  respectively 
research  development and related engineering spending increased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in research  development and related engineering expense principally reflects million in higher spending on communication systems and million on control systems 
segment earnings which exclude corporate expenses and other income and expense increased during fiscal to million compared to million in the prior year 
segment earnings as a percent of sales were and in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  principally reflecting a million increase in avionics systems 
avionics systems benefited from strong gross profit  partially offset by a million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  principally due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
segment earnings also benefited from increased earnings of interface technologies systems and communication systems of million and were partially offset by a million decrease in control systems 
interface technologies benefited from strong gross profit from sales of input devices for casino gaming and medical applications 
the increase in communication systems earnings was due to incremental earnings from the racal acoustics acquisition of million and improved gross margin 
control systems earnings were impacted by decreased gross profit and million in increased development costs 
sensors systems segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  mainly reflecting a million decrease in advanced sensors gross profit  offset by decreased selling  general and administrative expenses  principally due to the million impairment on a subsidiary trade name recorded in fiscal advanced materials segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  primarily reflecting a million increase in defense technologies  partially offset by decreased earnings from sales of engineered materials 
defense technologies principally reflected a million increase in earnings for countermeasures operations and decreased earnings of combustible ordnance 
the increase in countermeasures earnings reflected strong gross profit and a turnaround from a million operating loss incurred in fiscal the decrease in combustible ordnance is due to decreased gross profit 
the reduction in engineered materials earnings reflected million in costs associated with closing a facility and a million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains  principally on forward contracts which are marked to market each period 
interest expense increased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting increased senior debt and higher borrowings under capitalized lease obligations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid off million in senior subordinated debt and incurred a loss of million due to the extinguishment of debt 
on january   we acquired racal acoustics for million or million 
racal acoustics develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense market segment 
the acquisition was funded with cash proceeds from the sale of uk based muirhead and traxsys and our line of credit 
to facilitate the acquisition of racal acoustics  we executed a million us dollar denominated intercompany loan with a wholly owned subsidiary  for which its functional currency is the pound sterling 
due to our holding of pounds sterling to fund the acquisition during a period of foreign exchange volatility  we incurred a million foreign currency transaction loss in january  which was recorded in other expense 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
the tax rate for fiscal was significantly lower due to enhanced tax benefits associated with specific foreign exchange losses and higher r d tax credits 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million discrete tax benefits were the result of four events 
the first event was a million benefit as a result of the release of tax reserves for uncertain tax positions mainly associated with losses on disposition of assets 
this release of tax reserves resulted from the expiration of a statute of limitations 
the second event was a million net reduction in deferred income tax liabilities  which was the result of the enactment of tax laws reducing the uk statutory income tax rate 
the third event was a million tax expense related to tax liabilities associated with an examination of the us federal and state income tax returns 
the fourth event was a million reduction of valuation allowances related to net operating losses and foreign tax credits that were generated in prior years 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million discrete tax benefits were the result of five events 
the first event was a million tax benefit for the reduction of previously recorded withholding tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of a us canadian tax treaty 
the second event was a million expense resulting from the reversal of previously recorded tax benefits associated with the implementation of cmc s sadi program 
the third event was a million tax benefit associated with the reconciliation of the prior year s us income tax return to the us income tax provision 
the fourth event was an adjustment that resulted in a reclassification of million of tax benefits from discontinued operations to continued operations offset by a million tax expense to establish a valuation allowance for us foreign tax credits that are not expected to result in a current or future reduction in us income taxes 
the fifth event was a million tax expense associated with the reconciliation of the prior year s foreign income tax returns to the foreign income tax provisions 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
we use forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these hedges qualify under us gaap  the amount of gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the related sale occurs 
also  we are subject to foreign currency gains or losses from embedded derivatives on backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our operating companies or its customers 
gains and losses on forward contracts  embedded derivatives  and revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the company for fiscal and are as follows in thousands forward foreign currency contracts gain loss forward foreign currency contracts reclassified from aoci embedded derivatives gain loss revaluation of monetary assets liabilities gain loss total new orders for fiscal were billion compared with billion for fiscal orders increased at our avionics controls and advanced materials and declined at sensors systems due to the downturn in commercial aviation 
backlog at the end of both fiscal and was billion 
approximately million is scheduled to be delivered after fiscal backlog is subject to cancellation until delivery 
fiscal compared with fiscal sales for fiscal decreased over the prior year 
fiscal contained weeks  while fiscal contained weeks 
sales by segment were as follows dollars in thousands increase decrease from prior year avionics controls sensors systems advanced materials total the increase in avionics controls reflected incremental sales from the racal acoustics acquisition and higher sales of cockpit avionics systems for military aviation 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of cockpit controls for commercial aviation oem and after market customers 
stronger sales of interface technologies devices to the casino gaming industry partially offset weakness in the medical market 
the decrease in sensors systems principally reflected the effect of foreign currency exchange rates at our non us operations  lower oem sales of temperature sensors and certain power system devices 
the decline in sensors systems sales for commercial aviation was partially offset by increased sales for military aviation 
sales through much of fiscal reflected a weaker euro relative to the us dollar 
the average exchange rate for the euro decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the average exchange rate for the pound sterling to the us dollar decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in advanced materials reflected weak sales across the segment due to lower commercial aviation build rates  weakened industrial commercial demand  delays in shipments at our us and us countermeasure flare operations and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
these decreases were partially offset by incremental sales from the acquisition of nmc 
the decrease in sales at our us countermeasure flare operations reflected a one month factory shutdown resulting from an incident in a cross blending facility 
the factory resumed operation in august but was further impacted by the delay in issuance of a multi year flare order from the us dod 
foreign sales  including export sales by domestic operations  totaled million and million  and accounted for and of our sales for fiscal and  respectively 
overall  gross margin as a percentage of sales was and in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
avionics systems gross margins in fiscal were enhanced by t b production sales and a military transport cockpit retrofit program  which offset weak results from our commercial aviation business 
control systems gross margins benefited from strong cost control actions taken early in the fiscal year  which offset the impact of lower commercial aviation sales and decreased after market spare sales 
sensors systems segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively 
gross margins were impacted by lower sales of temperature sensors and power systems to commercial aviation customers and a million write off of inventory due to the bankruptcy of eclipse 
advanced materials segment gross margin was and for fiscal and  respectively  principally reflecting reduced gross margins at our us and us countermeasure flare operations 
our us countermeasure flare operations gross margin was impacted by a one month shutdown of the factory due to an incident referred to above and a delayed receipt of a multi year flare order 
our uk countermeasure flare operations gross margin was impacted by a delayed shipment to an international customer 
accordingly  our recovery of fixed expenses at both our us and us operations decreased compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses which include corporate expenses increased slightly to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from the racal acoustics and nmc acquisitions and higher pension cost was substantially offset by the effect of exchange rates at our non us operations as well as lower incentive compensation expense  professional fees and effective cost control 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and in fiscal and  respectively 
research  development and related engineering spending decreased to million  or of sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal the decrease in research  development and engineering principally reflected decreased spending on the development of the integrated cockpit system for the t b military trainer  the am  increased customer and government assistance and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
segment earnings which exclude corporate expenses and other income and expense decreased during fiscal to million compared to million in the prior year 
segment earnings as a percent of sales were and in fiscal and  respectively 
avionics controls segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  reflecting strong earnings from our avionics systems operations and incremental earnings from our racal acoustics acquisition 
the improvement in avionics systems operating earnings principally reflected lower research  development and engineering expense for the t b military trainer 
our avionics systems business also benefited from strong earnings from production sales of our t b military trainer and a military transport cockpit retrofit program  which offset weakness in commercial aviation 
approximately of avionics systems canada based operations sales are denominated in us dollars and about of these sales are covered by forward contracts 
accounts receivable and the accounts payable denominated in us dollars and backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the company or its customer embedded derivatives are marked to market each period 
while the average exchange rate for the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  our canadian operations were not favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange in fiscal to the extent our sales were covered by foreign currency forward contracts executed before the drop in the canadian dollar 
fiscal was favorably impacted by the significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar from the end of our third fiscal quarter of to the end of our fourth quarter from marking to market our monetary assets and embedded derivatives 
control systems earnings benefited from cost control actions and strong earnings from sales of military aviation applications  which partially offset weak earnings from commercial aviation 
earnings from our interface technologies operations decreased from the prior year period due to lower earnings from a new product development with introductory pricing for a limited number of shipments and reduced earnings from our medical business 
sensors systems segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal the decrease in segment earnings principally reflected lower gross margins at our temperature and pressure sensors operations  start up costs at our mexico operation  a million inventory write off  and a million impairment on a subsidiary trade name 
management determined that a certain trade name useful life was no longer indefinite as a result of further integration of advanced sensors units and promotion of the advanced sensors brand name 
advanced sensors successfully negotiated a retroactive price increase in fiscal  however  the business continues to be impacted by a very competitive business environment in a down commercial aircraft market 
management has taken actions to reduce costs including but not limited to setting up operations in mexico 
our power systems earnings were consistent with fiscal lower gross margins at our power systems operations were substantially offset by decreased research  engineering and development due to increased governmental assistance and customer development funding and decreased am program development expenses 
advanced materials segment earnings were million or of sales in fiscal compared with million or of sales in fiscal  principally reflecting lower earnings from our countermeasure flare and engineered materials operations 
as stated above  our us countermeasure flare operations were impacted by a one month factory closure due to an incident in the cross blending facility and a delay in a multi year flare order 
additionally  earnings at our uk countermeasure flare operations were impacted by a delayed shipment to an international customer 
our us and us countermeasure flare operations incurred operating losses in both fiscal and accordingly  management is focused on improving margins on existing products 
the decrease in earnings at our engineered materials operations mainly reflected lower sales volumes and gross margins due to sales mix and a decreased recovery of fixed costs in a very competitive market in a down business cycle 
interest expense decreased to million during fiscal compared with million in the prior year  reflecting a lower interest rate 
on january   we acquired racal acoustics for million or million 
racal acoustics develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense market segment 
the acquisition was funded with cash proceeds from the sale of uk based muirhead and traxsys and our line of credit 
to facilitate the acquisition of racal acoustics  we executed a million us dollar denominated intercompany loan with a wholly owned subsidiary  for which its functional currency is the pound sterling 
due to our holding of pounds sterling to fund the acquisition during a period of foreign exchange volatility  we incurred a million foreign currency transaction loss in january  which was recorded in other expense 
the income tax rate for fiscal was compared with in fiscal the tax rate was lower than the statutory rate  as both years benefited from various tax credits and certain foreign interest expense deductions 
the tax rate for fiscal was significantly lower due to enhanced tax benefits associated with specific foreign exchange losses 
in fiscal  we recognized million in net discrete tax benefits 
the million discrete tax benefits were the result of five events 
the first event was a million tax benefit for the reduction of previously recorded withholding tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of a us canadian tax treaty 
the second event was a million expense resulting from the reversal of previously recorded tax benefits associated with the implementation of cmc s sadi program 
the third event was a million tax benefit associated with the reconciliation of the prior year s us income tax return to the us income tax provision 
the fourth event was an adjustment that resulted in a reclassification of million of tax benefits from discontinued operations to continued operations offset by a million tax expense to establish a valuation allowance for us foreign tax credits that are not expected to result in a current or future reduction in us income taxes 
the fifth event was a million tax expense associated with the reconciliation of the prior year s foreign income tax returns to the foreign income tax provisions 
in fiscal  we recognized million in discrete tax benefits 
the million in discrete tax adjustments were the result of five items 
the first item was the settlement of an examination of the us income tax returns for fiscal years through  which resulted in a million reduction of previously estimated income tax liabilities 
the second item was the enactment of tax laws reducing the canadian statutory corporate income tax rate  which resulted in a million net reduction of deferred income tax liabilities 
the third item was the accrual of million of tax reserves and interest related to the finalization of cmc s uncertain tax position analysis 
the fourth item was recording million of tax expense associated with the reconciliation of fiscal s us income tax return provision for income taxes 
the fifth item was the recording of million of tax benefits associated with the extension of the us research experimentation tax credit 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating unit  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
we use forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that these hedges qualify under us gaap  the amount of gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci until the related sale occurs 
also  we are subject to foreign currency gains or losses from embedded derivatives on backlog denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of our operating companies or its customers 
gains and losses on forward contracts  embedded derivatives  and revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the company for fiscal and are as follows in thousands forward foreign currency contracts gain loss forward foreign currency contracts reclassified from aoci embedded derivatives gain loss revaluation of monetary assets liabilities gain loss total new orders for fiscal were billion compared with billion for fiscal orders in fiscal include million in backlog acquired from the racal acoustics and nmc acquisitions 
new orders declined by million if racal acoustics and nmc acquired backlog is excluded 
avionics controls orders for fiscal decreased from the prior year period  excluding acquired backlog from the racal acoustics acquisition 
the decrease in avionics controls reflects a million order for a military transport cockpit upgrade booked in october and reduced requirements for commercial aviation 
sensors systems orders for fiscal decreased from the prior year period  principally reflecting reduced requirements for commercial aviation and the effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
advanced materials orders for fiscal decreased from the prior year period  excluding acquired backlog from the nmc acquisition 
the decrease principally reflected reduced requirements for defense  commercial aviation and industrial commercial requirements 
backlog at the end of both fiscal and was billion 
liquidity and capital resources working capital and statement of cash flows cash and cash equivalents at the end of fiscal totaled million  an increase of million from the prior year 
net working capital increased to million at the end of fiscal from million at the end of the prior year 
sources of cash flows from operating activities principally consist of cash received from the sale of products offset by cash payments for material  labor and operating expenses 
cash flows from operating activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase principally reflected higher operating earnings and lower cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans  partially offset by increased payments for interest and income taxes 
cash flows used by investing activities were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
cash flows used by investing activities in fiscal principally reflected the use of cash for capital assets of million  partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of pressure systems  inc of million 
the use of cash for investing activities in fiscal mainly reflected cash paid for acquisitions of million and capital expenditures of million  partially offset by cash proceeds from the sale of muirhead and traxsys of million 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million in fiscal and cash flows provided by financing activities were million in fiscal cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal principally reflected proceeds from the issuance of million in senior notes  partially offset by the repayment of our million senior subordinated debt due in cash flows provided by financing activities in fiscal mainly reflected a million us term loan due in to finance the racal acoustics acquisition  offset by million in repayments on our uk term loan 
capital expenditures net property  plant and equipment was million at the end of fiscal compared with million at the end of the prior year 
capital expenditures for fiscal and were million and million  respectively excluding acquisitions and included facilities  machinery and equipment and enhancements to information technology systems 
capital expenditures for fiscal and also included million and million  respectively  under a capitalized lease obligation related to a new facility for an avionics controls operation and a facility expansion for an interface technologies facility 
capital expenditures are anticipated to approximate million for fiscal we will continue to support expansion through investments in infrastructure including machinery  equipment  and information systems 
acquisitions on december   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of nmc group  inc nmc for approximately million in cash  including acquisition costs 
nmc designs and manufactures specialized light weight fasteners principally for commercial aviation applications 
nmc is included in our advanced materials segment 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of racal acoustics global ltd 
racal acoustics for million or million in cash  including acquisition costs 
racal acoustics develops and manufactures high technology ruggedized personal communication equipment for the defense and avionics market segment 
racal acoustics is included in our avionics controls segment 
debt financing total debt increased million from the prior year to million at the end of fiscal total debt outstanding at the end of fiscal consisted of million senior notes due in  million of senior notes due in  million of the us term loan  million under capital lease obligations  and million in borrowings under our secured credit facility and various foreign currency debt agreements and other debt agreements 
on august   the company issued million in senior notes due requiring semi annual interest payments in march and september of each year until maturity 
the net proceeds from the sale of the notes  after deducting million of debt issuance cost  were million 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the senior notes 
the senior notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company at any time prior to august   at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of redemption and a make whole provision 
in addition  before august   the company may redeem up to of the principal amount at plus accrued interest with proceeds of one or more public equity offerings 
the senior notes are also subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after august   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning august   and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on or after august  the company also has million outstanding of senior notes due in  with an interest rate of 
the senior notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the company 
the senior notes are guaranteed  jointly and severally on a senior basis  by all the existing and future domestic subsidiaries of the company unless designated as an unrestricted subsidiary  and those foreign subsidiaries that executed related subsidiary guarantees under the indenture covering the senior notes 
the senior notes are subject to redemption at the option of the company at any time prior to march   at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued interest to the date of redemption and a make whole provision 
the senior notes are also subject to redemption at the option of the company  in whole or in part  on or after march   at redemption prices starting at of the principal amount plus accrued interest during the period beginning march   and declining annually to of principal and accrued interest on or after march  in april  we amended our secured credit facility to provide for a million us term loan 
we used the proceeds from the loan to repay our outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and provide for enhanced liquidity 
borrowings under the us term loan facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a the libor rate plus or b the base rate defined as the higher of wachovia bank  national association s prime rate and the federal funds rate plus plus 
the loan is accruing interest at a variable rate based on libor plus and was on october  the principal amount of the us term loan facility is payable quarterly commencing on march   the first four payments equal to of the original loan balance  the following four payments equal to  with a final payment equal to on march  during fiscal  we repaid the remaining balance of million of our million uk term loan 
during fiscal we paid down million  or million  of our million uk term loan and terminated an interest rate swap for a gain of million 
the interest rate swap exchanged the variable interest rate for a fixed interest rate of plus an additional margin amount determined by reference to our leverage ratio 
we believe cash on hand  funds generated from operations and other available debt facilities are sufficient to fund operating cash requirements and capital expenditures through fiscal current conditions in the capital markets are uncertain  however  we believe we will have adequate access to capital markets to fund future acquisitions 
pension and other post retirement benefit obligations our pension plans principally include a us pension plan maintained by esterline and non us plans maintained by cmc 
our principal post retirement plans include non us plans maintained by cmc  which are non contributory health care and life insurance plans 
we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date and we make actuarially computed contributions to our pension plans as necessary to adequately fund benefits 
our funding policy is consistent with the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
in fiscal and  operating cash flow included million and million  respectively  of cash funding to these pension plans 
we expect pension funding requirements for the plans maintained by esterline and cmc to be approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal the rate of increase in future compensation levels is consistent with our historical experience and salary administration policies 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on long term target asset allocations of equity and fixed income 
we periodically review allocations of plan assets by investment type and evaluate external sources of information regarding long term historical returns and expected future returns for each investment type and  accordingly  believe a to assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is appropriate 
current allocations are consistent with the long term targets 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our pension obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate rate of increase in future compensation levels assumed long term rate of return on plan assets we use a discount rate for expected returns that is a spot rate developed from a yield curve established from high quality corporate bonds and matched to plan specific projected benefit payments 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased by basis points in  pension liabilities in total would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
if all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal pension expense from a hypothetical basis points increase or decrease in both the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would not have a material effect on our pension expense 
we made the following assumptions with respect to our post retirement obligation in and principal assumptions as of fiscal year end discount rate initial weighted average health care trend rate ultimate weighted average health care trend rate the assumed health care trend rate has a significant impact on our post retirement benefit obligations 
our health care trend rate was based on the experience of our plan and expectations for the future 
a basis points increase in the health care trend rate would increase our post retirement benefit obligation by million 
a basis points decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease our post retirement benefit obligation by million 
assuming all other assumptions are held constant  the estimated effect on fiscal post retirement benefit expense from a hypothetical basis points increase or decrease in the health care trend rate would not have a material effect on our post retirement benefit expense 
research and development expense for the three years ended october   research and development expense has averaged of sales 
we estimate that research and development expense in fiscal will be to of sales for the full year 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of fiscal year end 
liabilities for income taxes were excluded from the table  as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments 
in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt credit facilities operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations seasonality the timing of our revenues is impacted by the purchasing patterns of our customers and  as a result  we do not generate revenues evenly throughout the year 
moreover  our first fiscal quarter  november through january  includes significant holiday vacation periods in both europe and north america 
this leads to decreased order and shipment activity  consequently  first quarter results are typically weaker than other quarters and not necessarily indicative of our performance in subsequent quarters 
disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our debt includes fixed rate and variable rate obligations at october  we are not subject to interest rate risk on the fixed rate obligations 
we are subject to interest rate risk on the us term loan

currency risks we own significant operations in canada  france and the united kingdom 
to the extent that sales are transacted in a foreign currency  we are subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk 
furthermore  we have assets denominated in foreign currencies that are not offset by liabilities in such foreign currencies 
at october   we had the following monetary assets subject to foreign currency fluctuation risk us dollar denominated backlog with customers whose functional currency is other than the us dollar  us dollar denominated accounts receivable and payable  and certain forward contracts  which are not accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the foreign exchange rate for the dollar relative to the euro increased to at october   from at october   the dollar relative to the uk pound increased to from  and the dollar relative to the canadian dollar decreased to from 
foreign currency transactions affecting monetary assets and forward contracts resulted in a million gain in fiscal  a million loss in fiscal  and a million gain in fiscal the million loss in fiscal was principally due to our holding of pounds sterling to fund the racal acoustics acquisition during a period of foreign exchange volatility  resulting in a million foreign currency transaction loss in january our policy is to hedge a portion of our forecasted transactions using forward exchange contracts with maturities up to months 
the company does not enter into any forward contracts for trading purposes 
at october   and october   the notional value of foreign currency forward contracts was million and million  respectively 
the net fair value of these contracts was an million asset and a million asset at october   and october   respectively 
if the us dollar increased or decreased by a hypothetical  the effect on the fair value of the foreign currency contracts would be million

critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may differ from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by our application of accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  accounting for inventories at the lower of cost or market  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets in business combinations  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for pension benefits  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is determinable  and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize product revenues at the point of shipment or delivery in accordance with the terms of sale 
sales are net of returns and allowances 
returns and allowances are not significant because products are manufactured to customer specification and are covered by the terms of the product warranty 
revenues and profits on fixed price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the achievement of contractual milestones and the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to total estimated costs for each contract cost to cost method 
we review cost performance and estimates to complete on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly 
the impact of revisions of profit estimates are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period they become evident 
amounts representing contract change orders are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable  and are determined on a percentage of completion basis measured by the cost to cost method 
claims are included in revenue only when they are probable of collection 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses expected to be incurred on accounts receivable balances 
judgment is required in estimation of the allowance and is based upon specific identification  collection history and creditworthiness of the debtor 
inventories we account for inventories on a first in  first out or average cost method of accounting at the lower of its cost or market 
the determination of market requires judgment in estimating future demand  selling prices and cost of disposal 
judgment is required when determining inventory cost adjustments 
inventory cost adjustments are recorded when inventory is considered to be excess or obsolete based upon an analysis of actual on hand quantities on a part level basis to forecasted product demand and historical usage 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we are also required to test goodwill for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value below its book value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  including a significant sustained decline in an entity s market value  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business  or other factors 
goodwill is tested for impairment in a two step process 
the first step step one of the goodwill impairment test involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit 
fair value fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or incurred or sold or settled in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced liquidation sale 
a reporting unit is generally defined at the operating segment level or at the component level one level below the operating segment  if said component constitutes a business 
the fair value of a reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value  which is defined as the book basis of total assets less total liabilities 
in the event a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  evidence of potential impairment exists 
in such a case  the second step step two of the impairment test is required  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  with the excess of fair value over allocated net assets representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of goodwill and million of indefinite lived intangible assets out of total assets of billion at october  the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
we performed our impairment review for fiscal as of july   and our step one analysis indicates that no impairment of goodwill or other indefinite lived assets exists at any of our reporting units 
during fiscal  management determined that the trade name useful life was no longer indefinite as a result of further integration of advanced sensors units and promotion of the advanced sensors brand name 
an impairment test was required to be performed to value the trade name at fair value  which resulted in the impairment charge of million 
the valuation of reporting units requires judgment in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and estimated product life cycles 
in making these judgments  we evaluate the financial health of the business  including such factors as industry performance  changes in technology and operating cash flows 
we used available market data and a discounted cash flow analysis in completing our annual impairment test 
we believe that our cash flow estimates are reasonable based upon the historical cash flows and future operating and strategic plans of our reporting units 
in addition to cash flow estimates  our valuations are sensitive to the rate used to discount cash flows and future growth assumptions 
the fair value of all but one of our reporting units exceeds its book value by greater than 
the fair value of one of our reporting units exceeds its book value by approximately 
a change in the discount rate used in the cash flow analysis would result in a change in the fair value of our reporting units of approximately million 
a change in the growth rate assumed in the calculation of the terminal value of cash flows would result in a change in the fair value of our reporting units by million 
none of these changes would have resulted in any of our reporting units to be impaired 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets that are to be disposed of are required to be reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
an asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is considered impaired when estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event the carrying amount of such asset is not deemed recoverable  the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
as we have grown through acquisitions  we have accumulated million of definite lived intangible assets 
the amount of any annual or interim impairment could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results for the period in which the charge is taken 
contingencies we are party to various lawsuits and claims  both as plaintiff and defendant  and have contingent liabilities arising from the conduct of business 
we are covered by insurance for general liability  product liability  workers compensation and certain environmental exposures  subject to certain deductible limits 
we are self insured for amounts less than our deductible and where no insurance is available 
an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
pension and other post retirement benefits we account for pension expense using the end of the fiscal year as our measurement date 
we select appropriate assumptions including discount rate  rate of increase in future compensation levels and assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and expected annual increases in costs of medical and other health care benefits in regard to our post retirement benefit obligations 
our assumptions are based upon historical results  the current economic environment and reasonable expectations of future events 
actual results which vary from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  accordingly  are recognized in expense in these periods 
significant differences between our assumptions and actual experience or significant changes in assumptions could impact the pension costs and the pension obligation 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position and results of operations
