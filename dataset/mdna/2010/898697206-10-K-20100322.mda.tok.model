please see information concerning forward looking statements on page 
table of contents overview our mission is to provide simple  useful services that help people unlock the power of the internet 
we accomplish this by reducing the complexity our customers experience as they acquire  deliver or use internet services such as domain name registration  email and other internet services 
our primary distribution channel is a global network of more than  resellers in more than countries who typically provide their customers  the end users of the internet  with a critical component for establishing and maintaining an online presence 
our primary focus is serving the needs of this network of resellers by providing superior services  easy to use interfaces  proactive and attentive customer service  reseller oriented technology and agile design and development processes 
we seek to provide superior customer service to our resellers by anticipating their business needs and technical requirements 
this includes providing easy to use interfaces that enable resellers to quickly and easily integrate our services into their individual business processes  and offering brandable end user interfaces that emphasize simplicity and visual appeal 
we also provide second tier support to our resellers by email and phone in the event resellers experience issues or problems with our services 
in addition  our network operating center provides proactive support to our resellers by monitoring all services and network infrastructure to address deficiencies before customer services are impacted 
we believe that the underlying platforms for our services are one of the most mature  reliable and functional reseller oriented provisioning and management platforms in our industry  and we continue to refine  evolve and improve these services for both resellers and end users 
to assist us in forecasting growth and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our operational strategies  we categorize our revenue into the following services opensrs  our wholesale service  manages over nine million domain names  millions of mailboxes and tens of thousands of digital certificates through a network of over  web hosts  internet service providers  or isps  and other resellers around the world 
platypus  our billing service  provides isps with an industry specific solution for billing  service provisioning and customer account management 
hover  our retail service  offers services similar to those of opensrs to consumers and small businesses 
yummynames  our domain portfolio service  manages tens of thousands of domain names  most of which generate advertising revenue and many of which we offer for resale via our reseller network and other channels 
included in the yummynames domain portfolio are over  domains that allow over two thirds of americans to purchase a domain or email address based on their name 
butterscotch  our content service  operates two advertising supported websites  butterscotch 
com and tucows 
com  which provide content to help consumers overcome the complexity of modern technology and the internet  in the form of over  videos and over  software and mobile listings and articles 
additionally  butterscotch provides custom video production services for technology manufacturers and isps 
we periodically acquire companies or technology when we determine that the related products or technology are strategic or complementary to our current or future service offerings  as opportunities arise 
for example on july   we acquired innerwise  inc  or iyd  a privately held icann accredited registrar offering domain services through a worldwide wholesale affiliate network 
on june   we acquired mailbank 
com  inc doing business as netidentity 
we use the assets from this acquisition to offer personalized internet services directly to end users through 
table of contents hover and to resellers through opensrs personal names service  as well as to generate income from the parked page of each domain address 
to expand our presence in the email market  on january   we acquired all of the hosted messaging assets of critical path  inc our business model is characterized by non refundable  up front payments  which lead to recurring revenue and positive operating cash flow 
we are an icann accredited registrar and manage over eight million domains 
net revenues opensrs we derive revenue from our reseller network by providing them with reseller services that comprise a domain services  b email services and c other services 
these other services currently consisting of secure sockets layer  or ssl  certificates  blogware and website building tools that are used by our resellers to create bundles of internet services for their end users along with billing solutions for isps 
opensrs domain service historically  the domain services provided by opensrs domain service have been the largest portion of our business and encompasses all of our services as an accredited registrar related to the registration  renewal  transfer and management of domain names 
in addition  this service fuels other revenue categories as it often is the initial service for which a customer will engage us  enabling us to follow on with other services and allowing us to add to our domain portfolio by purchasing names registered through us upon their expiration 
we also provide resellers with the ability to sell personal names 
this service allows resellers the opportunity to sell email addresses based on our domain portfolio of surname domain names 
on august   in advance of the announced october registry fee increases  we modified our pricing structure for domain names to provide greater visibility into the various fees that make up the cost of a domain name  by breaking out the cost of the registry and icann fees separately from our management fee 
the management fee provides our resellers with access to our provisioning and management tools to enable them to register and administer domain names and access to additional services like whois privacy and dns services  enhanced domain name suggestion tools and access to our premium domain name services

except for certain large customers with whom we have negotiated alternative arrangements  payments for the full term of service  or billed revenue  is received at the time of activation of service 
all fees received in connection with domain name registration are non refundable  and where appropriate  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service

this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
yummynames we derive revenue from our portfolio of domain names by displaying advertising on the domains and by making them available for sale or lease 
in addition we display advertising on parked pages within opensrs 
parked pages are domain names registered with us that do not yet contain an active website 
when a user types one of these domain names into a web browser  they are presented with dynamically generated links that are pay per click advertising 
every time a user clicks on one of these links  it generates revenue for us through our partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay per click advertising 
portfolio names are sold through our premium domain name service  auctions or in negotiated sales 
the size of our domain name portfolio varies over time  as we acquire and sell domains on a regular basis to maximize the overall value and revenue generation potential of our portfolio 
in evaluating names for sale  we consider the potential foregone revenue from pay per click advertising  as well as other factors 
the name will be offered for sale if  based on our evaluation  the name is deemed non essential to our business and management believes that deriving proceeds from the sale is strategically more beneficial to the company 
portfolio names that have been acquired from third parties or through acquisition are included as intangible assets with indefinite lives on our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we also offer the same services to our customers  allowing them to make available names registered by them for monetization on a similar basis 
for customer names  we earn a referral fee for premium names or names sold or leased  and participate on a revenue share basis for names offered through our pay per click advertising program 

table of contents we recognize revenue from these services  net of any fees payable to resellers or customers  immediately upon completion of the service  or in the case of advertising revenue  on a monthly basis once the advertising has been served 
hover we generate revenues from the provisioning and management of internet services  on a retail basis  to consumers and small businesses through our hover 
com website 
these services include domain registration and other internet services such as email and personalized email through our portfolio of surname based domain names  as well as an easy to use interface that allows users to connect domain names to websites and email addresses through a unique dns forwarding system 
depending on the service offered  we typically receive fees for our services 
our customers generally purchase services for terms of one to ten years  with a majority of services purchased for a one year term 
certain services are also offered on a monthly basis 
payments for the full term of all services  or billed revenue  are received at the time of service activation and  where appropriate  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during quarterly and annual periods 
butterscotch we also generate advertising and other revenue through two ad support content sites  butterscotch 
com and tucows 
com 
butterscotch 
com derives revenue from banner and text advertising on the site  as well as from video advertising and product placement within the videos that make up the bulk of the site 
in addition  revenue is earned through custom video production for technology manufacturers and internet services customers 
tucows 
com advertising revenue is generated from third party advertisers and from software developers who rely on us as a primary source of distribution 
software developers use our author resource center to submit their products for inclusion on our site and to purchase promotional placement of their software 
software developers may also purchase other promotional services on a cost per click or flat rate basis 
software developers are able to promote their software through advertising services including keyword search placements  banners  promotional placements  expedited reviews and premium data services 
revenue is also generated from companies that contract with us to provide them with co branded content 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
to the extent that we do not meet the minimum number of impressions that we guarantee to customers post presentation  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
custom video production revenue is recognized on acceptance of the completed video by the customer 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and methods 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties made by management that may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   or fiscal  includes further information on the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the application of these estimates  including those related to the recoverability of investments  useful lives and valuation of intangible assets  valuation of goodwill  fair value measurement of assets and liabilities  product development costs  revenue recognition and deferred revenue and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition policy we earn revenues from the following services  opensrs domain  email and other services  yummynames  hover  and butterscotch 
with respect to the sale of domain registrations and other internet services  we earn registration fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to resellers and registrars on a monthly basis 
we also enter into revenue arrangements in which a reseller may purchase a combination of services multiple element arrangements 
when fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
fair value is established by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for arrangements where fair value exists only for the undelivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue related to the delivered items  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
payments for the full term of all services  or billed revenue  are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
revenue from the sale of domain names consists primarily of amounts earned for the transfer of rights to domain names that are currently under the company s control 
collectability of revenues generated is subject to a high level of uncertainty  accordingly revenues are recognized only when payment is received 
we also generate advertising and other revenue through our online libraries of shareware  freeware and online services presented at our websites  tucows 
com and butterscotch 
com 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
to the extent that the minimum number of impressions we guarantee to customers is not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved 
custom video production revenue is recognized on acceptance of the completed video by the customer 
changes to contractual relationships in the future could impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 
in those cases where payment is not received at the time of sale  additional conditions for recognition of revenue apply 
the conditions are i that the collection of sales proceeds is reasonably 
table of contents assured and ii that we have no further performance obligations 
we record expected refunds  rebates and credit card charge backs as a reduction of revenues at the time of the sale based on historical experiences and current expectations 
should these expectations not be met  adjustments will be required in future periods 
we establish reserves for possible uncollectible accounts receivable and other contingent liabilities which may arise in the normal course of business 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by taking into account factors such as our historical collection and write off experience  the number of days the customer is past due and the status of the customer s account with respect to whether or not the customer is continuing to receive service 
the contingent liability estimates are based on management s historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the reported amounts of liabilities and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  credit losses have been within our expectations and the reserves we have established have been appropriate 
however  we have  on occasion  experienced issues which have led to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
should these issues occur more frequently  additional reserves may be required 
valuation of intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired in business combinations 
intangible assets consist of acquired technology  brand  customer relationships  non competition agreements  surname domain names and direct navigation domain names 
intangible assets  comprising technology  brand value  customer relationships and non competition arrangements related to the acquisition of boardtown corporation in april  the acquisition of the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january  the acquisition of mailbank 
com inc in june and the acquisition of innerwise  inc 
in july  are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods of two to seven years 
goodwill and indefinite life intangibles are not be amortized  but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  through a comparison of fair value to carrying amount 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we review goodwill at least annually for possible impairment in the fourth quarter of each year 
we have other finite life intangible assets consisting of patented and non patented technologies 
these intangible assets are amortized over their expected economic lives 
the lives are determined based upon the expected use of the asset  the estimated average life of the replacement parts of the reporting units products  the stability of the industry  expected changes in and replacement value of distribution networks and other factors deemed appropriate 
with regards to property  equipment and definite life intangible assets  we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite life intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable 
there was no impairment recorded on definite life intangible assets and property and equipment during and determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
the long term financial forecast 
table of contents represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
however  actual performance in the near term and longer term could be materially different from these forecasts  which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
we apply a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit that is more than likely to be realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
as we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical and future levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event that it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period that such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of a recorded net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period that such determination would be made 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the probability that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered to assess its realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  impacting net income or net loss in the period when such determinations are made 

table of contents results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net revenues the following table presents our net revenues  by revenue source year ended december  opensrs domain services email services other services total opensrs services yummy names hover butterscotch increase over prior period increase percentage the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  opensrs domain services email services other services total opensrs services yummy names hover butterscotch total net revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december   or fiscal deferred revenue from domain name registrations and other internet services at december  increased to million from million at december  no customer accounted for more than of revenue during fiscal and  at december   one customer accounted for of accounts receivable 
significant management judgment is required at the time of recording of revenue to assess whether the collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
on an ongoing basis  we assess the ability of our customers to make required payments 
based on this assessment  we expect the carrying amount of our outstanding receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to be fully collected 

table of contents opensrs during fiscal  opensrs revenue increased by million to million when compared to fiscal the main contributor to this increase was domain services revenue  which increased by million to million  primarily as a result of the impact of the registry price increase that was levied by some of our domain name suppliers in october and from our continuing to aggressively compete to attract new clients and retain existing customers 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in email services revenue of million to million when compared to fiscal as previously disclosed  this decrease in email service revenue is primarily attributable to two factors our decision to eliminate certain enterprise customers acquired as part of the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january that were not part of our strategic focus and who were receiving pricing that was not competitive in the marketplaces  and certain of our email customers  who are media portal companies and for whom email is only a small component of their overall service offerings  have chosen to include their email services as part of larger supply contracts for competitive and cost control reasons 
the last of these customers migrated away from our hosted email platform during the three months ended december  as our marketing efforts to date have not yet been successful in offsetting these customer losses  these customer losses have had a material impact on our results of operations for email services for fiscal during fiscal  the total new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations that we processed increased by million to million registrations as compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from our continuing to aggressively compete to attract new clients and retain existing customers 
while we anticipate that the number of new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations will continue to incrementally increase  the volatility in the market could affect the growth of domain names that we manage 
as of december   the total domain names under our management had increased by million to million domain names  as compared to the total domain names under our management as of december  in addition  we provide provisioning services on a monthly basis to accredited registrars who use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their own accreditation 
as of december   we managed million domain names on behalf of other accredited registrars  an increase of million domain names compared to the million as of december  yummynames net revenues from our yummynames domain portfolio service for fiscal increased by million  or  to million compared to fiscal during fiscal  we earned million by making domain names in our portfolio available for sale or lease  compared to million during fiscal in addition we earned million from our pay per click advertising or parked pages program during fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase primarily reflects the timing of larger portfolio sales of domain names as well as the improved performance we are currently experiencing with our auction initiatives 
these increases have been partially offset by the decrease in the delivery of third party advertisements on parked pages of million as a result of the impact our domain name sales have on our advertising revenue and the general economic conditions resulting in a generally slower advertising environment 

table of contents the market for monetization of domain names is rapidly evolving and there is no guarantee that we will be able to grow revenue at the rate achieved during fiscal  nor that we will be able to continue to acquire the same caliber of names for our portfolio from future expiring domains or that names we acquire in future will provide the same revenue impact as we have experienced from past acquisitions 
in addition  the revenue we derive from domain portfolio services is driven by general macroeconomic factors that affect internet advertising 
our advertising expenditures are typically sensitive to economic conditions and tend to decline in recessionary periods and other periods of economic uncertainty 
a slowing economy may thus be accompanied by a decrease in advertising spending which could adversely impact our ability to grow or maintain our domain portfolio services revenue 
hover net revenues from hover for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease primarily resulted from the impact of the sale of our retail hosting assets during fiscal on current year revenues 
to a lesser extent  our decisions to reclassify certain retail customers acquired in the iyd acquisition that did not meet our definition of retail customers to opensrs and de emphasize new customer acquisitions while we transitioned our retail customers from our domain direct  netidentity and iyd services to hover also contributed to this decrease 
butterscotch net revenues from butterscotch for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease is primarily a result of the contraction in the yields from our syndicated google feeds  and decreased revenue from our author resource center of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in advertising and video revenue of million 
cost of revenues opensrs opensrs domain service cost of revenues for domain registrations represents the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are initially recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the period 
opensrs email service cost of revenues for email services are payable to third party providers for licensing and royalty costs related to the provision of certain components of our email services 
fees payable for these components are included in the cost of revenues in the month they are incurred 
other opensrs services costs of revenues for other reseller services include fees paid to third party service providers  primarily for ssl certificates and for printing services in connection with platypus 
fees payable for ssl certificates are amortized on a basis consistent with the provision of service  generally one year  while monthly printing fees are included in cost of revenues in the month they are incurred 

table of contents yummynames costs of revenues for our domain portfolio service represent the amortization of registry fees for domains added to our portfolio over the renewal period  which is generally one year  the value attributed under intangible assets to any domain name sold and any impairment charges that may arise from our assessment of our domain name intangible assets

hover costs of revenues for our provision and management of internet services on a retail basis include the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service and includes the amortization of registry fees payable to renew the domains in our surname 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
butterscotch costs of revenues for our ad supported content sites include the fees paid to third party service providers  primarily for digital certificates sold through our content sites and content license fees 
general as a significant portion of our expenses are incurred in canadian dollars  the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar has positively impacted network costs  sales and marketing expenses  technical operations and development expenses and general and administrative expenses during fiscal when compared to fiscal exchange rates are  however  subject to significant and rapid fluctuations  and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
network costs network costs include personnel and related expenses  depreciation and amortization  communication costs  equipment maintenance  stock based compensation and employee and related costs directly associated with the management and maintenance of our network

table of contents yummynames costs for yummynames for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased by million  to million  as a result of the registry price increases 
this was partially offset as a result of the total number of names in our portfolio declining  primarily as a result of the sale of domain names 
hover costs for hover for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by million  to million  and primarily reflects the lower revenue experienced during the year as well as the impact that the sale of our retail hosting assets during the fiscal year has had on our retail cost structure 
network costs network costs before depreciation and amortization for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  primarily as a result of lower bandwidth  support contract and workforce costs 
the decrease is primarily attributable to the lower co location costs stemming from the closure and relocation of our us based co location facilities during september and the restructuring we implemented in november network depreciation and amortization costs for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million  primarily as a result of certain of our older computer hardware being fully depreciated and not requiring replacement

in addition to these decreases  we recognized a foreign exchange loss of million during fiscal as compared to a foreign exchange loss of million during fiscal this million decrease was primarily due to the impact of translating our canadian dollar net assets on hand at december   to our functional currency of us dollars 
this impact has resulted from the significant weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar compared to fiscal in addition  these decreases were offset by general and administrative expenses increasing by million as a result of additional public listing and workforce related costs incurred during the period

loss gain in fair value of forward exchange contracts although our functional currency is the us dollar  a major portion of our fixed expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our goal with regard to foreign currency exposure is  to the extent possible  to achieve operational cost certainty  manage financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations and to neutralize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements 
accordingly  we enter into foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk on portions of our canadian dollar exposure 
as we did not comply with the documentation requirements for hedge accounting  we account for the fair value of the derivative instruments within the consolidated balance sheet as a derivative financial asset or liability and the corresponding change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
year ended december  loss gain in fair value of forward contracts decrease increase over prior period we have entered into forward exchange contracts to meet a portion of our future canadian dollar requirements through april the impact of the fair value adjustment on unrealized foreign exchange on these contracts for fiscal was a net gain of million  as compared to a net loss of million for fiscal this net gain in fair value of forward contracts results from a combination of the impact from the change in foreign exchange rates over time  as well as from the impact of the settlement of forward exchange contracts as they mature

other income and expenses year ended december  other income  net decrease over prior period decrease percentage other income  net  decreased by million  or  to million from million as compared to fiscal the net decrease in other income during fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily the result of our recording a profit of million on the sale of certain of our hover shared hosting assets during fiscal as well as our receiving dividends of million during fiscal from afilias  a company in which we held an investment 
afilias did not pay any dividends during fiscal effective september  we completed the sale of our investment in afilias back to afilias and no longer hold any interest in the company 
this net decrease in other income was partially offset by our recording an incremental gain on the sale of our investment in afilias of million during fiscal when compared to fiscal 
table of contents in addition  in june we received an additional payment of million in connection with the infonautics patents that we assigned in to a third party 
in connection with the assignment of these patents  we retained the right to share in certain revenue relating to any cash flow received by the third party with respect to the commercialization of these patents 
this revenue is comparable to the million we recognized in june in connection with these patents 
as the third party s costs of commercializing the patents are expected to increase in the future  we do not expect any future revenue received to be material 
also  net interest expense decreased during fiscal when compared to the fiscal by million  primarily as a result of the monthly capital repayments of million and the annual cash sweep payment of million we made in april pursuant to the terms of our bank of montreal credit facility

the reduction in the deferred tax liability relates to the rate at which the company expects the temporary differences resulting form its unlimited life intangibles to reverse 
this change in estimate arose as a result of the company no longer being subject to material state tax in the united states given the change in the jurisdictions in which the company now operates 
we operate in various tax jurisdictions  and accordingly  our income is subject to varying rates of tax 
losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot be used to offset income taxes payable in another period 
our ability to use income tax loss carryforwards and future income tax deductions is dependent upon our operations in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arise 
our provision for income taxes primarily relates to our estimate for federal alternative minimum tax obligations for fiscal and pennsylvania state franchise tax related to prior years 
no provision for income taxes other than for alternative minimum tax and pennsylvania franchise tax was recorded during the year because we had net operating losses to offset against our operating income in our major operating jurisdictions

the unrecognized tax benefit for the research and development claim is not expected to be significant 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to taxes in tax expense 
we did not have significant interest and penalties accrued as of december  and december  respectively

table of contents opensrs during fiscal  opensrs revenue increased by million to million when compared to fiscal the main contributor to this increase was domain services revenue  which increased by million to million 
this increase was primarily as a result of increased volumes from new and existing customers 
the market for domain name and other internet services remains intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
effective august  as part of our ongoing initiatives to improve our competitive position and to provide wholesale domain resellers a transparent cost breakdown  we invested in a new cost plus domain pricing structure and a reduction in our domain name pricing 
these steps have contributed to our average selling price declining and are likely to adversely impact our revenue and profitability in the short term 
they also may or may not result in increased volumes  which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability in the longer term 
during fiscal  the number of domain names that we processed increased by million to million new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations  compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from our continuing to compete aggressively to attract new clients and retain existing customers and from the incremental registrations we generated as a result of our acquisition of its your domain  or iyd  in july while we anticipate that the number of new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations will continue to incrementally increase  the volatility in the market could affect the growth of domain names under our management 
at december   the total number of domain names under our management increased by million to million  compared to the total number of domain names under our management as at december   partly as a result of the names we acquired in our acquisition of iyd in july as of december   we provided provisioning services on a monthly basis to accredited registrars who use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their own accreditation 
as of december   we managed an incremental million domain names on behalf of other accredited registrars  compared to million for accredited registrars at december  this increase was partially offset by a decrease in email services revenue of million to million when compared to fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from our elimination of certain enterprise customers that were acquired as part of the hosted messaging business of critical path in january that were not part of our strategic focus and who were receiving pricing that was not competitive in the marketplace 
since our primary interest is in the reseller customers in the critical path  inc customer base  we felt the proper course of action would be for us to continue to support enterprise customers for as long as they choose to utilize our service and to assist any enterprise customer who wished to migrate either in house or to another supplier 
in addition  during fiscal  we began investing in the re architecture of our email service due to the inefficiencies in the older platform we had purchased from critical path  inc these inefficiencies were undermining our customers experience  were increasing our customer support incidents and were limiting our ability to close new business 
as a result of the above factors  during fiscal  we lost four significant customers  who contributed approximately to our current monthly email service revenue 
three of these customers are media portal companies who have become more focused on controlling costs 
email is a small component of their service offerings and for competitive and cost control reasons they are choosing to allow their email services to be included in larger supply contracts 
this resulted in one of these customers migrating off of our hosted email platform during the three months ended september  and two of the other customers notifying us of their intention to leave our platform in the near future 
while the loss of our customer in september did not materially impact our results for fiscal  if our efforts to actively market our email service to new customers are not successful in 
table of contents offsetting these customer losses  we expect that the loss of these customers may have a material impact on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  or fiscal yummynames net revenues from our yummynames domain portfolio service for fiscal decreased by million  or  to million compared to fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from sales of names from our portfolio of domain names amounting to million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal these fiscal sales included  during the fiscal quarter ended june   an atypically large sale of million representing approximately  domain names 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in the revenue we earned from the delivery of third party advertisements on parked pages during fiscal compared to fiscal the market for monetization of domain names is rapidly evolving and there is no guarantee that we will be able to grow revenue  nor that we will be able to continue to acquire the same caliber of names for our portfolio from future expiring domains or that names we acquire in future will provide the same revenue impact as in past acquisitions 
hover net revenues from retail services for fiscal compared to fiscal increased by million  or  to million 
the primary contributors to this increase were the recognition of million of deferred revenue as a result of the sale of our remaining retail hosting customers  an increase of million from our provisioning of personalized email through our portfolio of surname based domain names through the netidentity website and an increase of million from retail domain registration and other internet services as a result of the iyd acquisition 
butterscotch net revenues from butterscotch for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased by million  or  to million

based on the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material interest rate risk exposure at december  although we have a functional currency of us dollars  a major portion of our fixed expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our policy with respect to foreign currency exposure is to manage financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations with the objective of neutralizing some of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements 
accordingly  we have entered into numerous foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk on portions of our canadian dollar exposure 
the following contracts were entered into in in order to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on march   we entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts  whereby amounts of  are converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis from january to june at a foreign exchange rate of 
on april   we entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts  whereby amounts of  are converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis from july to september at a foreign exchange rate of 
on june   we entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts  whereby amounts of   and  are converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis from january to december at a foreign exchange rate of 
on june   we entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts  whereby amounts of  are converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis from january to may at a foreign exchange rate of 
on october   we entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts  whereby amounts of  are converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis from january to march at a foreign exchange rate of 
on october   we entered into a forward foreign exchange contract  whereby an amount of  is converted into canadian dollars in april at a foreign exchange rate of 
on october   we entered into a forward foreign exchange contract  whereby an amount of  is converted into canadian dollars in april at a foreign exchange rate of 
on october   we entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts  whereby amounts of   and  are converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis from may to december at a foreign exchange rate of 
as we do not comply with the documentation requirements for hedge accounting  we account for the fair value of the derivative instruments within the consolidated balance sheet as a derivative financial asset or liability and the corresponding change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have no other freestanding or embedded derivative instruments 
the impact of the fair value adjustment on unrealized foreign exchange forward contracts for fiscal was a net gain of approximately million  and for fiscal  the impact was a net loss of approximately million  which is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of 
table of contents million 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with a notional value of million 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis model for foreign exchange exposure over fiscal the analysis used a modeling technique that compares the us dollar equivalent of all expenses incurred in canadian dollars  at the actual exchange rate  to a hypothetical adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on the market rates in effect during fiscal the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a decrease in net income for fiscal of approximately million 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the actions to hedge or mitigate these risks 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents  marketable securities  foreign exchange contracts and accounts receivable 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions whom we have evaluated as highly creditworthy and commercial paper 
similarly  we enter into our foreign exchange contracts with major banks and financial institutions 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers  generally granting uncollateralized credit terms to our customers  and maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical experience and our expectation of future losses
