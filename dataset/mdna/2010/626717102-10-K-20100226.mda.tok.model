item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview murphy oil corporation is a worldwide oil and gas exploration and production company with refining and marketing operations in the united states and united kingdom 
a more detailed description of the company s significant assets can be found in item of this form k report 
murphy generates revenue primarily by selling oil and natural gas production and refined petroleum products to customers at hundreds of locations in the united states  canada  malaysia  the united kingdom and other countries 
the company s revenue is highly affected by the prices of oil  natural gas and refined petroleum products that it sells 
also  because crude oil is purchased by the company for refinery feedstocks  natural gas is purchased for fuel at its refineries and oil production facilities  and gasoline is purchased to supply its retail gasoline stations in the us that are primarily located at walmart supercenters  the purchase prices for these commodities also have a significant effect on the company s costs 
in order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business  revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products  amortization of capital expenditures and expenses related to exploration and administration 
profits and generation of cash in the company s refining and marketing operations are dependent upon achieving adequate margins  which are determined by the sales prices for refined petroleum products less the costs of purchased refinery feedstocks and gasoline and expenses associated with manufacturing  transporting and marketing these products 
murphy also incurs certain costs for general company administration and for capital borrowed from lending institutions 
worldwide oil and north american natural gas prices were significantly lower on average in than in the sales price for a barrel of west texas intermediate crude oil in averaged  lower than in the nymex natural gas price averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu in  down from crude oil and north american natural gas prices fell precipitously with the economic decline in late the year began with quite low demand for hydrocarbons and consequently very weak prices for oil and natural gas 
crude oil and natural gas prices generally rose as progressed as the worldwide economy began a slow recovery from the significant downturn 
changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the company  especially the price of crude oil as oil represented approximately of the total hydrocarbons produced on an energy equivalent basis by the company in in  the percentage of hydrocarbon production represented by oil is expected to decline to about due to higher natural gas production at kikeh and block sk in malaysia  tupper in british columbia and at the eagle ford shale area in south texas 
if the prices for crude oil and natural gas should weaken in or beyond  the company would expect this to have an unfavorable impact on operating profits for its exploration and production business 
such lower oil and gas prices could  but may not  have a favorable impact on the company s refining and marketing operating profits 
results of operations the company generated net income in of million per diluted share compared to net income in of billion per diluted share 
in the company s net income was million per diluted share 
the large decline in net income in comparison to was attributable to lower earnings in both the exploration and production and refining and marketing operations 
weaker oil and natural gas sales prices were the primary reasons for lower earnings in the exploration and production business  while lower retail gasoline margins in the us and weaker refining margins in the uk led to the earnings decline for refining and marketing 
the significant increase in net income compared to was caused by improved earnings for exploration and production operations in  primarily due to higher sales prices for the company s oil and natural gas production  higher crude oil production volumes and gains on sale of two assets in canada 
the earnings for the company s refining and marketing operations were an annual record in  with the improvement from primarily in the uk and mostly caused by strong margins at the milford haven  wales refinery following the company s purchase of the remaining of this asset in december the net cost of corporate activities not allocated to the operating segments was lower in than in  after rising in compared to the prior year 
further explanations of each of these variances are found in the following sections 
income from continuing operations  excluding results from ecuador operations which are reported as discontinued operations  was million per diluted share in  billion per diluted share in  and million per diluted share in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements vs 
net income in totaled million per diluted share compared to billion per diluted share in net income included income from discontinued operations of million per diluted share in and a loss of million per diluted share in discontinued operations are associated with the company s former operations in ecuador which were sold in march the favorable result from discontinued operations in was mostly attributable to an after tax gain of million from disposal of the ecuador properties 
income from continuing operations amounted to million per diluted share in  down from billion per diluted share in the lower earnings in from continuing operations was attributable to lower income in the exploration and production e p and refining and marketing r m businesses 
e p income from continuing operations was million lower in compared to  primarily attributable to weaker sales prices for crude oil  which were down about per barrel for the company s production 
other unfavorable impacts in included a million charge after taxes to effect an anticipated reduction in the company s working interest in the terra nova oil field offshore newfoundland  lower north american natural gas sales prices  gains on sale of canadian assets in that did not repeat in  and higher extraction costs for oil and gas produced in e p results in benefited from higher volumes of oil and gas produced  lower exploration expenses and after tax income of million from an anticipated recovery of federal royalties paid between and on certain leases in the gulf of mexico 
income from r m operations was million lower in compared to  essentially attributable to two factors weaker retail gasoline marketing margins in the us and weaker refining margins in the uk the net cost of corporate activities was million less in than primarily due to gains from transactions denominated in foreign currencies in compared to losses on such transactions in during the us dollar generally weakened in comparison to the british pound sterling  which provided a favorable foreign currency impact to the company s earnings 
additionally  the current year benefited from higher interest income  including interest due to the company through december  on the anticipated federal royalty refund  and lower net interest expense 
sales and operating revenues were billion lower in than primarily due to lower prices realized on gasoline and other fuels sold by the company 
crude oil and natural gas sales prices were also lower in than but these lower prices were partially offset by income of million in associated with an anticipated recovery of federal royalties previously paid by the company on certain gulf of mexico properties 
gain on sale of assets classified in continuing operations was million less in than principally due to significant gains on two assets sold in canada in berkana energy and the lloydminster properties 
interest and other income in was million higher than due to a combination of more favorable income effects from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and interest income on the anticipated recovery of federal royalties 
crude oil and product purchases expense was billion less in than due mostly to the lower cost of gasoline purchased for resale in the us retail marketing operations 
operating expenses in were million less than mostly due to lower natural gas and other power costs in the most recent year at synthetic oil operations in canada and at the company s three refineries 
exploration expenses in were million below primarily due to less spending on geophysical data in the us  canada and malaysia  and less amortization expense for undeveloped leasehold costs in the tupper area in western canada 
selling and general expenses rose million in compared to primarily due to a combination of higher costs for employee compensation and professional services 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was up million in mostly due to higher oil and natural gas production volumes and higher depreciation rates per barrel of oil equivalents produced  with the higher costs mostly caused by new fields that came on stream in impairment of long lived assets of million in was attributable to write off of the remaining net book value for one underperforming natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
accretion of asset retirement obligations increased million in primarily due to future abandonment costs to be incurred on oil and gas wells drilled in malaysia in a charge of million was recorded in to reflect the estimated cash settlement to be paid on an anticipated reduction in the company s working interest in the terra nova field from the present to about 
this redetermination process at terra nova is expected to be completed by the end of interest expense in was million less than primarily due to lower interest rates charged on certain bank loans during the just completed year 
interest capitalized to oil and gas development projects in was million below the level due to commencement of production at the thunder hawk and azurite oil fields in the third quarter income tax expense was million less in than primarily due to lower pretax income in the current year 
the effective tax rate on a consolidated basis increased from in to in due to a larger percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions in and due to higher exploration and other expenses in foreign jurisdictions where no income tax benefit can presently be recognized due to no assurance that these expenses will be realized in future years to reduce taxes owed 
the tax rate in both years was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceed the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the company s uncertain ability to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years 
income from discontinued operations was million higher in than mostly due to an after tax gain of million on sale of ecuador operations in march 
table of contents 
index to financial statements vs 
net income in was billion per diluted share compared to million per diluted share in the consolidated net income improvement of million in was attributable to higher earnings in both e p and r m operations 
the net cost of corporate activities in was higher than in  partially offsetting the improved results in e p and r m 
earnings from continuing e p operations were markedly improved in  increasing by million compared to  as this business benefited from higher sales prices for oil and natural gas  higher sales volumes for crude oil and gains from asset dispositions 
e p earnings were unfavorably affected in compared to by lower sales volumes for natural gas and higher expenses for exploration  production  depreciation  depletion and administration 
the r m business generated record profits in  increasing million compared to the improvement was primarily due to refining profits generated in the uk in following the acquisition of the remaining of the milford haven  wales  refinery in december r m earnings in included an unfavorable impact in the uk from noncash inventory revaluations 
following the milford haven acquisition  the company s uk operations recorded an after tax noncash last in  first out inventory charge of million in to reduce the carrying value of crude oil and refined products inventory to beginning of year prices  which were significantly lower than at the end of the year 
the net costs of corporate activities increased by million in compared to  with the cost increase mostly attributable to higher losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies and higher net expenses for interest and administration 
the foreign currency losses occurred because the us dollar generally strengthened against other significant foreign currencies used in the company s business in  especially compared to the british pound sterling 
the higher net interest expense was mostly caused by lower interest capitalized to e p development projects 
the period included higher corporate administrative costs mostly due to higher expense for employee compensation and community and other support activities 
sales and other operating revenues were billion higher in than in mostly due to higher sales prices and sales volumes for gasoline and other refined products  higher sales prices and sales volumes for crude oil produced by the company  and higher revenues from merchandise sales at retail gasoline stations 
sales prices for natural gas were higher in than  but the favorable price variance was somewhat offset by lower natural gas sales volumes in gain loss on sales of assets in was million higher than in and these realized pretax gains were primarily associated with the sale of interests in berkana energy and the lloydminster area heavy oil properties in canada 
interest and other income was lower by million in due primarily to greater losses on foreign currency exchange  which were mostly attributable to a stronger us dollar compared to the british pound sterling 
crude oil and product purchases expense increased by billion in compared to due to a combination of higher purchase prices and throughput volumes of crude oil and other feedstocks at the company s refineries  higher prices and volumes of refined petroleum products purchased for sale at retail gasoline stations  and higher levels of merchandise purchased for sale at the gasoline stations 
the higher crude oil purchase volumes in were caused by a full year of operations at the milford haven  wales refinery following the december acquisition of the remaining interest 
operating expenses increased by million in compared to and included higher refinery and retail station costs  and higher costs for oil field operations in malaysia and synthetic oil operations at syncrude 
refining costs increased due to both higher natural gas and other fuel costs and the full year of operations at milford haven following the acquisition 
exploration expenses were million higher in than in and were primarily associated with higher leasehold amortization expenses at the tupper area in western canada  more dry hole expense in malaysia and australia  and higher geophysical expenses in suriname 
exploration expenses in included costs for settlement of two work commitments on leases formerly held on the scotian shelf offshore eastern canada 
selling and general expenses were million higher in than in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million higher in compared to due mostly to higher crude oil production volumes  but also due to higher barrel equivalent unit rates for depreciation for virtually all e p segments and higher depreciation for the remaining of the milford haven  wales refinery acquired in december impairment of long lived assets of million in primarily related to closing underperforming gasoline stations in the us and canada 
accretion of asset retirement obligations increased by million in due to additional abandonment obligations incurred as additional kikeh development wells were drilled during the year and higher estimated costs of future abandonment obligations at syncrude 
net costs associated with hurricanes of million in was due to a downward adjustment of anticipated insurance recoveries at the meraux refinery following hurricane katrina based on updated loss limits communicated in by the company s primary property insurer 
interest expense incurred in was million less than in due to lower average debt levels during compared to the prior year 
the amount of interest costs capitalized to property  plant and equipment decreased by million in due to lower levels of interest allocable to worldwide e p development projects 
income tax expense was million higher in than in and was mainly attributable to a higher level of pretax earnings 
the effective income tax rate for consolidated earnings increased from in to in the tax rate in both years was higher than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements combination of us state income taxes  certain foreign tax rates that exceed the us federal tax rate  and certain exploration and other expenses in foreign taxing jurisdictions for which no income tax benefit is currently being recognized because of the uncertain ability of the company to obtain tax benefits for these costs in future years 
the results of discontinued operations in were unfavorable to by million primarily due to a higher revenue sharing with the government of ecuador 
during  the government claimed a share of block realized sales prices that exceeded a benchmark price that escalated with the monthly us consumer price index 
this government revenue sharing claim increased from above the benchmark price to in october at year end  the benchmark oil price for block was approximately per barrel 
the average realized sales price after revenue sharing with the ecuadorian government for block oil was per barrel during  a decrease of from the higher revenue sharing led to unprofitable operating results in for operations in ecuador 
the company sold the ecuador properties in march segment results in the following table  the company s results of operations for the three years ended december  are presented by segment

crude oil  condensate and gas liquids sales volumes from continuing operations were higher in compared to  compared to an increase in oil production volumes of in oil sales volumes did not rise as much as oil production volumes during primarily due to the timing of oil tanker liftings at the kikeh field offshore malaysia 
sales volumes at kikeh were below production levels in due to an increase in the volume of unsold barrels at the field at year end and a higher percentage of such unsold inventory barrels at the field being attributable to the company s account 
during  kikeh sales volumes exceeded production  which effectively reduced the company s unsold inventory balance from year end higher us crude oil sales volume in was primarily attributable to a partial year of production at the gulf of mexico thunder hawk field  which started up in july  and less downtime in the gulf of mexico for hurricanes 
lower crude oil sales volumes in canada in were mostly attributable to the sale of the lloydminster heavy oil field in early and production declines at the maturing hibernia and terra nova fields 
lower crude oil sales volume in the uk in was primarily due to no lifting at the schiehallion field in the current year 
damage to sales equipment at the schiehallion production facility caused the company s scheduled lifting in december to be deferred until crude oil sales volumes at kikeh in rose compared to due to higher annual production 
natural gas sales volumes increased in and the improvement was partially attributable to higher gas volumes produced during in the gulf of mexico  the tupper area in western canada and at kikeh  and partially due to new production at the sarawak gas fields offshore malaysia following start up in september the company s realized crude oil sales prices averaged less in than and north american natural gas sales prices averaged below levels 

table of contents 
index to financial statements e p earnings improved million in compared to with the significant increase primarily due to higher realized sales prices for the company s oil and natural gas production  higher crude oil production volumes and gains on disposals of canadian assets 
results in were favorably impacted by income tax benefits associated with tax rate reductions in canada 
the results were unfavorably affected compared to by lower natural gas sales volumes and higher expenses for exploration  production  depreciation  depletion  administration and accretion of discounted abandonment liabilities 
crude oil sales volumes from continuing operations in were higher than in  compared with a increase in crude oil production from continuing operations in compared to crude oil sales volumes grew more than production in due to the timing of sale transactions as the company had a lower inventory of unsold crude oil at year end compared to a year earlier 
the significant unsold crude oil inventory at year end was mostly at kikeh where sales volumes lagged production in late during the start up phase of this field 
during  oil sales volumes were higher than in as larger volumes produced at the kikeh field were partially offset by lower oil sales volumes at most other producing areas 
lower us crude oil sales volumes in were primarily due to reduced production levels at several gulf of mexico fields following hurricanes gustav and ike 
certain gulf of mexico facilities owned by other companies downstream of our producing fields were shut down for repairs for an extended period of time in the fourth quarter lower oil sales volumes in canada were attributable to field decline at hibernia  field decline and a higher royalty rate at terra nova  sale of the lloydminster heavy oil property in western canada and more downtime at syncrude 
lower crude oil sales volumes in the uk and at the west patricia field  offshore sarawak malaysia  were mostly caused by production declines as these fields mature 
natural gas sales volumes were lower in than and the reduction was mostly due to the sale of berkana energy in january additionally  several of the company s gulf of mexico fields were either shut in or had curtailed gas production in late while downstream facilities owned by others were repaired following third quarter hurricanes 
the company s average realized oil sales price was higher in than  and the average north american natural gas sales price was higher in the results of operations for oil and gas producing activities for each of the last three years are shown by major operating areas on pages f and f of this form k report

production of heavy oil in the western canada sedimentary basin was  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in  primarily due to the sale of the lloydminster property in early and due to decline at properties operated by a third party in the seal area 
oil production offshore canada fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in due to field decline at terra nova and field decline and a higher net profit royalty rate at hibernia 
synthetic oil operations at syncrude had net production of  barrels per day in  up from  barrels per day in  with the increase caused by a lower royalty 
table of contents 
index to financial statements rate in due to sales prices significantly below those of the prior year 
oil production in malaysia increased from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  with the increase primarily due to higher production at the kikeh field  which recorded peak production levels in the current year 
oil production in malaysia was also favorably affected in by condensate produced at the sarawak gas fields that started up in september and higher net production at the west patricia field 
a higher portion of production at west patricia was allocated to the company s account in as costs incurred for development of sarawak gas fields increased the level of west patricia oil used to recover costs under the production sharing contract for blocks sk and sk oil production in the uk was  barrels per day in  down from  barrels per day in  with the decline primarily due to more downtime at the schiehallion field  most of which was caused by damage to the export hose that required production to be shut in for nearly all of the fourth quarter 
the azurite field offshore republic of the congo came on production in august and averaged  barrels per day for the full year 
the company sold its interest in block and other areas in ecuador in march and has accounted for ecuador as discontinued operations 
oil production in ecuador averaged  barrels per day in and  barrels per day in production of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids in increased by  barrels per day  or compared to  primarily due to continued ramp up of the kikeh field 
light oil production in canada declined from barrels per day in to barrels per day in due to sale of berkana energy in january heavy oil production in western canada fell from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  due to sale of the lloydminster property in and lower production volumes at the seal field in alberta 
oil production at hibernia  offshore newfoundland  was  barrels per day in  up slightly from  barrels per day in oil production decreased at terra nova  offshore newfoundland  from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in the reduction at terra nova was attributable to natural field decline plus a higher royalty rate 
syncrude production totaled  barrels per day in compared to  barrels per day in  with the decline caused by more downtime for repairs and maintenance in oil production declined in the us from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in the reduction was primarily at gulf of mexico fields where production was curtailed while awaiting repairs to downstream facilities owned by other companies that were damaged by third quarter hurricanes 
oil production in the uk was down from  barrels per day in to  barrels per day in  with the reduction caused by declining production at the company s primary fields in the north sea 
the west patricia field  offshore sarawak malaysia  had net production of  barrels per day in after production levels of  barrels per day in west patricia experienced declining production and a smaller portion of production was allocated to the company s account under the production sharing contract 
oil production from discontinued operations in ecuador totaled  barrels per day in  compared to  barrels per day in due to a shut down of the block development drilling program during following an arbitrary decision by the government to impose a revenue sharing provision starting in late on all sales prices exceeding a benchmark price that averaged about per barrel during the year 
worldwide sales of natural gas were million cubic feet mmcf per day in  mmcf per day in and mmcf per day in natural gas production in the us averaged mmcf per day in  compared to mmcf per day in the higher volume in was primarily attributable to the mondo nw field that reached peak production in the current year  start up of the thunder hawk field in july and less downtime in the gulf of mexico due to hurricanes 
natural gas production in canada rose from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in due to ramp up of tupper area production in western canada 
tupper started up in december natural gas production in malaysia also rose significantly as the sarawak gas development started up in september and kikeh gas production  which started up in december  was onstream for a full year in natural gas production during at sarawak and kikeh averaged mmcf per day and mmcf per day  respectively 
natural gas production in the uk fell from mmcf per day in to mmcf per day in primarily due to the amethyst field being shut in for the first four months of for equipment repairs 
natural gas sales volumes in the united states averaged mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in the increase of mmcf per day in would have been significantly higher but for the reduced gas production associated with hurricane damage to downstream facilities late in the year 
natural gas sales volumes in canada averaged mmcf per day in  down from mmcf per day in in january  the company sold berkana energy  formerly its largest gas producing asset in canada 
natural gas sales volumes in the uk averaged mmcf per day in compared to mmcf per day in the higher uk gas sales volumes were mostly attributable to more gas volumes sold at the mungo and monan fields in the north sea 
natural gas production commenced from the kikeh field offshore sabah malaysia in december and sales volumes averaged mmcf per day for the year

index to financial statements the company s average worldwide realized sales price for crude oil  condensate and gas liquids from continuing operations fell from per barrel in to per barrel in the decline of was attributable to lower average prices in for crude oil and matches the decline in the average price of west texas intermediate wti crude oil during the year 
crude oil prices began to weaken in late as the economic downturn worsened 
crude oil prices started at low levels due to a weakening worldwide demand for energy 
but oil prices improved as the year progressed and in december wti averaged per barrel 
compared to  the company s average crude oil sales prices fell in the us to per barrel  heavy oil prices in canada fell to per barrel  offshore canada oil was sold for less and averaged per barrel  synthetic crude oil sold for less at per barrel  crude oil in malaysia was down and averaged per barrel  and uk crude oil production sold for less at per barrel

uk oil prices increased to per barrel in in malaysia  oil produced at the kikeh field sold for less in than in  with an average of per barrel for kikeh came on stream in august and all sales during that year occurred in the fourth quarter when prices were at the strongest point during at the west patricia field offshore sarawak the average sales price of per barrel was above the average price 
the company s natural gas sales prices fell significantly in compared to as weaker demand for energy led to an oversupply of natural gas inventories 
the company s average realized north american natural gas sales prices were per thousand cubic feet mcf in  a decline of from the per mcf realized in in the uk the average sales price fell from per mcf in to per mcf in natural gas produced in offshore sarawak was sold at an average price of per mcf during the year 
the company s natural gas sales prices rose in compared to the company s average realized north american natural gas sales prices increased by in to per thousand cubic feet mcf 
in the uk  the average natural gas price rose to per mcf 
based on sales volumes and deducting taxes at marginal rates  each per barrel and per mcf fluctuation in prices would have affected earnings from exploration and production continuing operations by million and million  respectively 
the effect of these price fluctuations on consolidated net income cannot be measured precisely because operating results of the company s refining and marketing segments could be affected differently

table of contents 
index to financial statements synthetic oil operations was mostly caused by lower natural gas fuel costs 
the increase in production costs per barrel for synthetic oil in compared to was due to higher costs for fuel and repairs and lower production levels 
production cost per unit in malaysia was lower in compared to due to higher oil production at kikeh  and new natural gas production offshore sarawak and higher natural gas production at kikeh that collectively altered the production mix toward lower cost natural gas in the current year 
the lower average cost per barrel in malaysia in compared to was attributable to higher production at kikeh where unit costs per equivalent barrel are lower than at west patricia 
higher per barrel production expense in the uk in compared to was primarily attributable to lower production levels at the schiehallion and amethyst fields  both of which were offline for repairs for a portion of the increase in the average cost per barrel in the uk in versus was caused by lower overall production levels and higher repair costs 
the high per unit production cost in republic of the congo in is expected to be significantly lower in future years due to higher production associated with a full year of operations at the azurite field beginning in exploration expenses from continuing operations for each of the last three years are shown in total in the following table  and amounts are reported by major operating area on pages f and f on this form k report 
expenses other than leasehold amortization are included in the capital expenditures total for exploration and production activities 
millions of dollars dry holes geological and geophysical other undeveloped lease amortization total exploration expenses dry hole expense was million lower in than due to more successful exploratory drilling results during a year with higher drilling capital expended 
during  lower dry hole costs in malaysia and the us was somewhat offset by higher costs in australia and republic of the congo 
dry hole expense was million more in than in and was attributable to more exploration drilling capital expenditures in with mostly new e p management in  much of that year was spent reevaluating the company s worldwide exploration drilling prospects 
the higher costs for dry holes in was mostly in the offshore waters of malaysia and western australia 
geological and geophysical g g expenses were million lower in compared to the reduction in g g in was attributable to less spending on seismic in the gulf of mexico  the tupper area in western canada  and offshore sabah in malaysia  but included higher spending for seismic covering the semai ii concession  offshore indonesia 
g g expenses were million higher in mostly due to a d seismic program at block  offshore suriname  and more seismic activities in the tupper area in western canada 
other exploration costs were million lower in compared to mostly due to less office costs allocable to republic of the congo exploration activities in the current year 
other exploration expense in was million lower than mostly due to a million settlement in for unfulfilled work commitments on two expiring scotian shelf leases  offshore eastern canada 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense was million lower in compared to mostly due to lower amortization for tupper and tupper west area leases in western canada  but partially offset by higher lease amortization cost at eagle ford shale leases in south texas in the current year 
undeveloped leasehold amortization expense rose million in compared to  primarily due to amortization of undeveloped land acquisition costs at the tupper property where the company aggressively added undeveloped acreage in recent years 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in to write off the remaining costs of a poorly performing natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
a million charge in the exploration and production business for asset impairment in related to write down of an unused e p administrative office to estimated fair value 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for exploration and production continuing operations totaled million in  million in and million in the million increase in compared to was primarily attributable to a combination of higher overall hydrocarbon production levels and start up of new fields in the gulf of mexico  western canada and republic of the congo that had higher per unit depreciation rates than older fields already on production 
the increase in expense of million in compared to was mostly caused by a much higher production level at the kikeh field  offshore sabah  malaysia 
the exploration and production business recorded expenses of million in  million in and million in for accretion on discounted abandonment liabilities 
because the abandonment liability is carried on the balance sheet at a discounted fair value  accretion must be recorded annually so that the liability will be recorded at full value at the projected time of abandonment 
the increase in accretion costs in compared to was mostly attributable to additional wells drilled in the current year at the kikeh and sarawak fields  offshore malaysia 
the increase in accretion costs in was associated with higher estimated abandonment costs at syncrude and additional development wells drilled at the kikeh field

index to financial statements the effective income tax rate for exploration and production continuing operations was in  in and in the effective tax rate was higher in than due to both higher expenses in foreign tax jurisdictions where no tax benefit can be currently recognized due to lack of sufficient revenue to realize a current benefit and a higher percentage of profits in malaysia where the effective tax rate of is higher than the effective rates in the us and canada 
the effective tax rate was higher in than the previous year as included net tax benefits from an enacted reduction of the federal tax rate in canada 
the net benefit from the canadian tax rate reduction  which effectively reduced recorded deferred tax liabilities  was million in the effective tax rates in and exceeded the us statutory tax rate of due to higher overall foreign tax rates and exploration activities in areas where current tax benefits cannot be recorded by the company 
the effective tax rate in was slightly below the us statutory tax rate primarily due to the enacted canadian federal tax rate reduction during the year 
a million us tax benefit was realized in for a charitable building donation 
tax jurisdictions with no current tax benefit on expenses primarily include non revenue generating areas in malaysia  suriname  australia and indonesia 
each main exploration area in malaysia is currently considered a distinct taxable entity and expenses in certain areas may not be used to offset revenues generated in other areas 
no tax benefits have thus far been recognized for costs incurred for blocks h  p  l and m  offshore sabah  and blocks pm  offshore peninsula malaysia 
at december   approximately of the company s us proved oil reserves and of the us proved natural gas reserves are undeveloped 
virtually all of the total us undeveloped reserves on a barrel of oil equivalent basis are associated with the company s various deepwater gulf of mexico fields 
further drilling  facility construction and well workovers are required to move undeveloped reserves to developed 
in block k malaysia  virtually all oil reserves of million barrels for the kakap field are undeveloped pending completion of facilities and development drilling directed by another company

the company s north american r m operations generated earnings of million in  million in and million in north american operations include refining activities in the united states  marketing activities in the united states and canada  and ethanol production operations in the us north american r m earnings fell significantly in compared to primarily due to weaker margins in the company s retail gasoline chain 
fuel margins in the retail chain were hurt in by both lower demand for gasoline and diesel due to the weak economy and generally rising wholesale fuel costs caused by crude oil prices that rose gradually during the year 
results for the refining business in the us was slightly improved in compared to primarily due to insurance proceeds at the meraux  louisiana plant  and higher asphalt sales volumes and better asphalt margins at the superior  wisconsin plant 
final insurance settlements at the meraux refinery for hurricane katrina related property damage and a crude oil spill and damages caused by a fire provided pretax benefits of million during on october   the company acquired an ethanol production facility in hankinson  north dakota 
the ethanol facility generated profitable operations in the fourth quarter due to the favorable spread between corn prices and ethanol sales prices 
north american r m earnings were down slightly in compared to as lower profits generated by the us refining operations were not fully offset by significantly stronger retail marketing profits in demand for gasoline declined in the us in compared to due to higher costs and a weakening economy 
this lower demand led to much tighter crack spreads for us refineries in compared to crack spreads represent the uplift of gasoline and distillate prices over the cost of crude oil feedstocks 
the operating results for the company s north american refining business were negatively impacted by hurricane katrina related costs of million  which was caused by a downward adjustment of expected insurance recoveries based on an updated loss limit estimated by the company s primary insurer 
the company s refinery in superior  wisconsin also generated

the refining margin was hurt by weak demand for refined products during the period  which led to an industry wide oversupply of gasoline and diesel products in the area during the improved uk earnings in compared to were mostly related to profits generated by the milford haven refinery as the refinery generated stronger margins in and the period included a significant inventory charge 
the company acquired of the milford haven  wales refinery on december   after having a interest in the asset prior to that date 
in association with the late milford haven acquisition  the company built a significant additional layer of crude oil and refined products inventory 
the period included a million after tax non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of these higher inventory levels to early prices 
under the company s lifo inventory accounting policy  inventory volume increases are priced at the first purchase prices during the year  and the prices of crude oil and refined products were at a much lower level in early compared to the price at the time these products were acquired near year end the lifo inventory charge reduced the average carrying value for these additional inventories in the uk by approximately per barrel 
in late  the company purchased six existing fuel stations and leased stations in england and scotland 
unit margins in the united kingdom averaged per barrel in  per barrel in and per barrel in overall sales of refined products in the uk declined to  barrels per day in  essentially due to lower production of finished products at the company s milford haven  wales refinery 
sales of refined products in the uk increased more than in compared to the prior year  which was attributable to additional quantities of refined products produced and sold throughout at the milford haven refinery following the company s acquisition of the remaining interest in december corporate the after tax costs of corporate activities  which include interest income  interest expense  foreign exchange gains and losses  and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions  were million in  million in and million in the net cost of corporate activities in was million lower than in  primarily due to more favorable effects of foreign currency exchange  which is associated with transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the respective operation s predominant functional currency 
the effect of foreign currency exchange after taxes in the corporate segment was a gain of million in compared to a cost of million in the favorable effects in were primarily associated with the company s uk downstream operations where a significant amount of transactions for this sterling functional currency business are denominated in us dollars

index to financial statements environmental matters murphy and other companies in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations dealing with the environment 
compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations affects our overall cost of business 
areas affected include capital costs to construct  maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities  in concert with ongoing operating costs for environmental compliance 
anticipated and existing regulations affect our capital expenditures and earnings  and they may affect our competitive position to the extent that regulatory requirements with respect to a particular production technology may give rise to costs that our competitors might not bear 
environmental regulations have historically been subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities  and we are unable to predict the ongoing cost to us of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of such regulations on our operations 
violation of federal or state environmental laws  regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties  injunctions and construction bans or delays 
a discharge of hazardous substances into the environment could  to the extent such event is not insured  subject us to substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable regulations and claims by neighboring landowners and other third parties for any personal injury and property damage that might result 
the most significant of those laws and the corresponding regulations affecting our us operations are the us clean air act  which regulates air emissions the us clean water act  which regulates discharges into us waters the us comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  which addresses liability for hazardous substance releases the us federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  which regulates the handling and disposal of solid wastes the us federal oil pollution act of opa  which addresses liability for discharges of oil into navigable waters of the united states the u 
s safe drinking water act  which regulates disposal of wastewater into underground wells regulations of the us department of the interior governing offshore oil and gas operations 
these laws and their associated regulations establish limits on emissions and standards for quality of air  water and solid waste discharges 
they also generally require permits for new or modified operations 
many states and foreign countries where the company operates also have or are developing similar statutes and regulations governing air and water as well as the characteristics and composition of refined products  which in some cases impose or could impose additional and more stringent requirements 
we are also subject to certain acts and regulations  including legal and administrative proceedings  governing remediation of wastes or oil spills from current and past operations  which include but may not be limited to leaks from pipelines  underground storage tanks and general environmental operations 
cercla commonly referred to as the superfund act  and comparable state statutes primarily address historic contamination and impose joint and several liability upon potentially responsible parties prp  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
cleanup of contaminated sites is the responsibility of the owners and operators of the sites that released  disposed  or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
cercla also authorizes the us environmental protection agency epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible persons 
in the course of our ordinary operations  we generate waste that falls within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
we may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been disposed of or released into the environment 
cercla also requires reporting of releases to the environment of substances defined as hazardous or extremely hazardous and must be reported to the national response center  if they exceed an epa established reportable quantity 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the epa currently considers us to be a prp at two superfund sites 
the potential total cost to all parties to perform necessary remedial work at these sites may be substantial 
however  based on current negotiations and available information  we believe that we are a de minimis party as to ultimate responsibility at these superfund sites 
we have not recorded a liability for remedial costs on superfund sites 
we could be required to bear a pro rata share of costs attributable to nonparticipating prps or could be assigned additional responsibility for remediation at these sites or other superfund sites 
we believe that our share of the ultimate costs to clean up the superfund sites will be immaterial and will not have a material adverse effect on murphy s net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
we currently own or lease  and have in the past owned or leased  properties at which hazardous substances have been or are being handled 
although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control 
these properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws 
under such laws we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination 
while some of these historical properties are in various stages of negotiation  investigation  and or cleanup  we are investigating the extent of any such liability and the availability of applicable defenses and believe costs related to these sites will not have a material adverse affect on murphy s net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
rcra and comparable state statutes govern the management and disposal of solid wastes  with the most stringent regulations applicable to treatment  storage or disposal of hazardous wastes 
we generate non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to the requirements of rcra and comparable state statutes 
our operating sites also incur costs to handle and dispose of hazardous waste and other chemical substances 
the types of waste and substances disposed of generally fall into the following categories spent catalysts usually hydrotreating catalysts  spent used filter media  tank bottoms and api separator sludge  contaminated soils  laboratory and maintenance spent solvents  and industrial debris 
the costs of disposing of these substances are expensed as incurred and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during operations  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
such changes in the regulations could result in additional capital expenditures and operating expenses 
murphy allocates a portion of its capital expenditure program to comply with environmental laws and regulations  and such capital expenditures were million in and are projected to be million in our liability for remedial obligations includes certain amounts that are based on anticipated regulatory approval for proposed remediation of former refinery waste sites 
although regulatory authorities may require more costly alternatives than the proposed processes  the cost of such potential alternative processes is not expected to exceed the accrued liability by a material amount 
certain environmental expenditures are likely to be recovered by us from other sources  primarily environmental funds maintained by certain states 
since no assurance can be given that future recoveries from other sources will occur  we have not recorded a benefit for likely recoveries as of december  we are also involved in personal injury and property damage claims  allegedly caused by exposure to or by the release or disposal of materials manufactured or used in our operations 
under our accounting policies  an environmental liability is recorded when such an obligation is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
if there is a range of reasonably estimated costs  the most likely amount will be recorded  or if no amount is most likely  the minimum of the range is used 
recorded liabilities are reviewed quarterly 
actual cash expenditures often occur one or more years after a liability is recognized 
under opa  owners and operators of tankers  owners and operators of onshore facilities and pipelines  and lessees or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located are liable for removal and cleanup costs of oil discharges into navigable waters of the united states 
to the best of our knowledge  there has been no such opa claims made against murphy 
the epa has issued several standards applicable to the formulation of motor fuels  primarily related to the level of sulfur found in highway diesel and gasoline  which are designed to reduce emissions of certain air pollutants when the fuel is used 
several states have passed similar or more stringent regulations governing the formulation of motor fuels 
the epa s mandated requirements for low sulfur gasoline became effective in and both of our us refineries are now capable of producing the required low sulfur 
table of contents 
index to financial statements gasoline 
each of the us refineries must begin to produce the epa required ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd beginning in the meraux refinery is currently capable of producing this ulsd for all of its diesel production  and at the superior refinery equipment is being installed which will make the refinery capable of meeting the ulsd standard by the june compliance date 
the energy independence and security act eisa was signed into law in december the eisa through epa regulation requires refiners and gasoline blenders to obtain renewable fuel volume or representative trading credits as a percentage of their finished product production 
eisa greatly increases the renewable fuels obligation defined in the renewable fuels standard which began in september murphy is actively blending renewable fuel volumes through its retail and wholesale operations and trading corresponding credits known as renewable identification numbers rins to meet its obligation 
the federal water pollution control act of fwpca imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the fwpca imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation and damages 
we maintain wastewater discharge permits for our facilities where required pursuant to the fwpca and comparable state laws 
we have also applied for all necessary permits to discharge storm water under such laws 
we believe that compliance with existing permits and foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
our us operations are subject to the federal clean air act and comparable state and local statutes 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with these statutes in all states in which we operate 
amendments to the federal clean air act enacted in late require or will require most refining operations in the us to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the epa and state environmental agencies 
under the epa s clean air act authority  the national petroleum refinery npr initiative global consent decree was initiated as a national priority to investigate four marquee compliance areas for refinery operations i new source review prevention of significant deterioration for fluidized catalytic cracking units  heaters and boilers  ii new source performance standards for flares  sulfur recovery units  fuel gas combustion devices including heaters and boilers  iii leak detection and repair requirements  and iv benzene national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants 
murphy began negotiations with the epa in  but was interrupted by the events of hurricane katrina 
the states of louisiana and wisconsin are both parties to the npr 
negotiations with epa resumed in and are continuing 
while substantial progress has been made in these negotiations  the company expects to conclude npr negotiations in and will at that time have estimates of any additional capital and operating costs and penalty assessments  if any  which may be required because of the epa s findings 
our meraux  louisiana refinery is also currently negotiating with the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq regarding three compliance order notice of proposed penalty co nopp notifications regarding air and water discharges 
while we are in various stages of negotiations and or settlement  the company has proposed a settlement offer related to these co nopp negotiations 
the company does not expect the settlement of this matter to have a material adverse effect on company s net income  financial condition or liquidity in a future period 
world leaders have held numerous discussions about the level of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions 
as part of these discussions  the kyoto agreement was adopted in and was ratified by certain countries in which we operate or may operate in the future  with the united states being the primary country that has yet to ratify the agreement 
the agreement became effective for ratifying countries in and these countries have implemented regulations or are in various stages of developing regulations to address its contents that ultimately target a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions 
we are unable to predict how us regulations if any associated with the kyoto agreement will impact costs in future years 
the european union has adopted an emissions trading scheme in response to the kyoto agreement in order to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
our refining operations at milford haven currently have the most exposure to these requirements and may require purchase of emission allowances to maintain compliance with environmental permit requirements 
these environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred 
currently  various national and international legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions including carbon dioxide  methane and nitrous oxides are in various phases of discussion or implementation 
these include a recently promulgated epa regulation  mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases  which became effective december   and existing proposed us federal legislation cap and trade legislation  epa s greenhouse gas endangerment finding  epa s prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  low carbon fuel standards  etc 
and various state actions to 
table of contents 
index to financial statements develop statewide or regional programs  each of which have or could impose mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 
the impact of existing and pending climate change legislation  regulations  international treaties and accords could result in increased costs to i operate and maintain our facilities  ii install new emission controls on our facilities  and iii administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions trading program 
these actions could also impact the consumption of refined products  thereby affecting our refinery operations 
the physical impacts of climate change present potential risks for severe weather floods  hurricanes  tornadoes  etc 
at our meraux  louisiana refinery in southern louisiana and our offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico 
commensurate with this risk is the possibility of indirect financial and operational impacts to the company from disruptions to the operations of major customers or suppliers caused by severe weather 
the company has repositioned itself to take advantage of potential climate change opportunities by acquiring a renewable energy source through the acquisition of an ethanol production facility in hankinson  north dakota  thereby achieving a lower carbon footprint and an enhanced capability to meet governmental fuel standards 
the company is unable to predict at this time how much the cost of compliance with any future legislation or regulation of greenhouse gas emissions  or the cost impact of natural catastrophic events resulting from climate change  if it occurs  will be in future periods 
the company recognizes the importance of environmental stewardship as a core component of its mission as a responsible international energy company and has implemented sufficient disclosure controls and procedures to process climate change related information 
indeed  our environmental  health  and safety committee is a standing committee of the board of directors created to oversee and monitor the company s environmental  health  and safety ehs policies and practices 
further  in february  our board approved a worldwide environmental  health  and safety policy the ehs policy  which is available on the company s web site 
in addition to requiring that the company comply with all applicable ehs laws and regulations  the ehs policy includes a directive that the company will continue to minimize the impact of our operations  products and services on the environment by implementing economically feasible projects that promote energy efficiency and use natural resources effectively 
we likewise apply this conscientious approach to the issue of climate change 
as a companion to the ehs policy  the company s web site also contains a statement on climate change 
not only does this statement on climate change include our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions on an absolute basis while growing our upstream and downstream operations  the information on our web site describes actions we have already taken to move towards that goal 
while we are admittedly at the beginning of a process that will grow over time  the company has formed an internal climate change workgroup to address emerging climate change issues and improve energy efficiencies via the development of an energy efficiency forum 
this climate change workgroup is developing a comprehensive climate change plan aimed at preparing the company to succeed in a world challenged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
the plan includes incorporating climate change into our planning processes  reducing our own emissions  pursuing new opportunities and engaging legislative and regulatory entities externally 
greenhouse gas inventories have been conducted since moreover  a low carbon fuel standard sub committee was formed in to monitor  evaluate and develop implementation plans that may arise in connection with state climate change consortiums to legislate fuel standards 
although the initiatives cited above demonstrate the company s focus on environmental issues at the forefront of today s global public policy dialogue  the company s commitment in this area is nothing new 
for example  in the company completed its clean fuels project at the meraux refinery  making it one of the first refineries able to produce percent low sulfur gasoline  thereby reducing emissions and meeting or bettering current sulfur fuels standards 
as a result of this clean fuels initiative  the company estimates that the meraux refinery s low sulfur gasoline reduces vehicle emissions by more than  tons per year

safety matters we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local government authorities and citizens

osha conducted an inspection of our meraux  louisiana refinery from july september and on december  osha issued several compliance related citations and a proposed penalty 
the matter was settled with osha through payment of a  penalty with many of the osha items abated and agreement of a compliance schedule that calls for all items to be abated in other matters impact of inflation general inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the company operates  however  the company s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation 
crude oil and petroleum product prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand  with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to opec production levels and or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the near future 
natural gas prices are affected by supply and demand  which to a significant extent are affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas 
prices for oil field goods and services have generally risen with certain of these price increases such as drilling rig day rates having been significant during the last few years primarily driven by high demand for such goods and services when oil and gas prices were strong 
as noted earlier  oil and natural gas prices were considerably weaker in late and early  however  the prices for oil goods and services did not generally decline as significantly as oil and gas prices 
oil prices  and to a lesser extent natural gas prices  rebounded somewhat in from the low levels experienced in late and early should a low price environment for oil and gas return  the company anticipates that prices for certain equipment and services will decline due to falling demand for such items 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is not possible to determine what effect these prices will have on the future cost of oil field goods and services

significant accounting policies in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies requires significant estimates 
the most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below 
proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic method or probabilistic method is used for the estimation 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well  or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
sec rules require that we use an unweighted average of the oil and gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining proved reserve quantities 
these historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future 
the company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations 
estimated reserves are subject to future revision  certain of which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the company s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations 
the company s proved reserves of oil and gas are presented on pages f and f of this form k 
a favorable oil reserve revision in in the united states was attributable to favorable performance of the thunder hawk and front runner fields and federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields 
a favorable conventional oil revision in canada in was caused by performance of the terra nova field and improved heavy oil pricing which added reserves in the seal area 
due to changes in the sec s definition of proved oil reserves  which were first effective as of december   synthetic oil reserves are now included as proved oil reserves 
consequently  total synthetic oil reserves as of january  of million barrels have been added to total oil reserves in the positive revision to synthetic oil reserves during was attributable to lower royalties compared to a year ago 
an unfavorable revision to oil reserves in malaysia in was due to current year drilling results for a well in the kikeh field  along with reduced entitlements at kikeh and west patricia due to increased prices as compared to year end oil reserves in the uk reflected an unfavorable revision in because of an anticipated reduction in life expectancy for major equipment at the schiehallion project 
an unfavorable us oil revision in resulted from updated reservoir modeling of one field in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
an unfavorable revision in canada in was related to low heavy oil prices at year end  but this was partially offset by a favorable impact from better field performance in at hibernia 
a favorable oil reserve revision in malaysia in was attributable to better than anticipated drilling results and additional drilling opportunities in the main reservoir at the kikeh field  coupled with better reservoir performance and artificial lift improvements at the west patricia field 
an unfavorable oil reserve revision in the us in was mostly related to poor performance at one deepwater field in the gulf of mexico 
favorable oil reserve revisions in in canada related primarily to better performance at the hibernia

favorable oil revisions in malaysia related to west patricia and kikeh well performances 
in the us  a positive gas reserve revision in was caused by favorable performance of the thunder hawk  front runner and mondo nw fields as well as federal royalty relief for various deepwater fields 
in malaysia  a combination of increased entitlements due to pricing and drilling performance at the sarawak gas project led to positive gas revisions in gas reserves in the uk were favorably revised in because of the amethyst field gas compression project and better mungo field performance 
an unfavorable natural gas reserve revision in malaysia in was related to entitlement adjustments under the sarawak blocks sk and sk production sharing contract and gas volumes lost due to operational delays that restricted sales volumes at the kikeh field  offshore sabah 
the downward revisions to us natural gas reserves in was mostly caused by unfavorable production performance for gas wells at various fields in the gulf of mexico and onshore south louisiana 
the favorable natural gas reserve revision in canada in was mostly attributable to well performance at the natural gas field owned by a consolidated subsidiary 
the downward revision to natural gas reserves in malaysia is based on higher contractual sales prices at year end compared to the company cannot predict the type of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on net income 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
in some cases  a determination of whether a drilled well has found proved reserves cannot be made immediately 
this is generally due to the need for a major capital expenditure to produce and or evacuate the hydrocarbon s found 
the determination of whether to make such a capital expenditure is  in turn  usually dependent on whether additional exploratory wells find a sufficient quantity of additional reserves 
under current accounting rules  the company holds well costs in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
based on the time required to complete further exploration and appraisal drilling in areas where hydrocarbons have been found but proved reserves have not been booked  dry hole expense may be recorded one or more years after the original drilling costs are incurred 
there were no dry holes in  or that were drilled in prior years 
impairment of long lived assets the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment and goodwill in the consolidated balance sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  future capital and abandonment costs  future margins on refined products produced and sold  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable reserve revisions  expected deterioration of future refining and or marketing margins for refined products  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these same factors must be considered when evaluating a property s carrying value for possible impairment 
in making its impairment assessments involving exploration and production property and equipment  the company must make a number of projections involving future oil and natural gas sales prices  future production volumes  and future capital and operating costs 
due to the volatility of world oil and gas markets  the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been quite different from the company s projections 
estimates of future oil and gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves 
although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain  the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  however  there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection 
the company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available 
the company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long term inflation rates and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements known or expected changes in future operations 
although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable  at times  costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated 
in assessing potential impairment involving refining and marketing assets  the company evaluates its properties when circumstances indicate that carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events  which include projections of future margins  future capital expenditures and future operating expenses 
future marketing or operating decisions  such as closing or selling certain assets  and future regulatory or tax changes could also impact the company s conclusion about potential asset impairment 
impairment expense of million was recorded in to write off the remaining carrying value of one underperforming natural gas field in the gulf of mexico 
based on an evaluation of expected future cash flows from properties at year end  the company does not believe it had any other significant properties with carrying values that were impaired at that date 
the expected future sales prices for crude oil and natural gas used in the evaluation were based on quoted future prices for the respective production periods 
these quoted prices often reflect higher expected prices for oil and natural gas in the future compared to the existing spot prices at the time of assessment 
if quoted prices for future years had been lower  the smaller projected cash flows for properties could have led to significant impairment charges being recorded for certain properties in in addition  one or a combination of factors such as lower future sales prices  lower future production  higher future costs  lower future margins on refining and marketing sales  or the actions of government authorities could lead to impairment expenses in future periods 
based on these unknown future factors as described herein  the company cannot predict the amount or timing of impairment expenses that may be recorded in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its annual accounting period  b tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the company 
the company has deferred tax assets mostly relating to basis differences for property  equipment and inventories  and dismantlements and retirement benefit plan liabilities 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization 
a valuation allowance has been recognized for deferred tax assets related to basis differences for blocks h  pm  p  l and m in malaysia  exploration licenses in republic of the congo  suriname and australia  and certain basis differences in the uk due to management s belief that these assets cannot be deemed to be realizable with any degree of confidence at this time 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities  gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans murphy oil and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering most of its full time employees 
the company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired us employees 
the expense associated with these plans is determined by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third party actuaries 
the most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
for the retiree medical and insurance plans  the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate 
discount rates are based on the universe of high quality corporate bonds that are available within each country 
cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans 
the discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country 
expected plan asset returns are based on long term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics 
anticipated health care cost trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the company and an assessment of near term and long term trends for medical and drug costs 
based on bond yields at year end  the company has used a discount rate of in and beyond for the primary us plans 
although the company presently assumes a return on plan assets of for the primary us plan  it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions 
the smoothing effect of current accounting regulations tends to buffer the current year s pension expense from wide swings in liabilities and asset valuations 
the company s normal annual retirement and postretirement plan expenses are expected to increase slightly in compared to based on the effects of a growing employee base 
in  the company paid million into various retirement plans and million into postretirement plans 
the retirement plan contribution included a voluntary contribution 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of million to the primary us retirement plan 
in  the company is expecting to fund payments of approximately million into various retirement plans and million for postretirement plans 
approximately million of these anticipated payments in are not mandatory 
the company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years 
future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines  the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed  or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected 
as described above  the company s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions  primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets 
a decline in the discount rate would increase annual retirement and postretirement expenses by million and million  respectively  and a decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase retirement expense by million 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and other contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
the company s management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters  and makes its best estimate of the amount of losses and when they should be recorded based on information available to the company 
contractual obligations and guarantees the company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements  operating leases  purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure commitments  and other long term liabilities 
in addition  the company expects to extend certain operating leases beyond the minimum contractual period 
total payments due after under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown below 
amount of obligation millions of dollars total after total debt including current maturities operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total the company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields 
in addition  the company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section 
the company s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above 
in the normal course of its business  the company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide financial guarantees or letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the company fails to perform under those contracts 
the amount of commitments as of december  that expire in future periods is shown below 
amount of commitment millions of dollars total after financial guarantees letters of credit total material off balance sheet arrangements the company occasionally utilizes off balance sheet arrangements for operational or funding purposes 
the most significant of these arrangements at year end includes operating leases of floating  production  storage and offloading vessels fpso for the kikeh and azurite oil fields  an operating lease for a production facility at the thunder hawk field  a natural gas transportation contract for the tupper area in western canada and a hydrogen purchase contract for the meraux refinery 
the leases call for future monthly net lease payments through at kikeh  through at azurite  and through at thunder hawk 
the tupper transportation contract requires minimum monthly payments through the meraux refinery contract to purchase hydrogen ends in the hydrogen contract requires a monthly minimum base facility charge whether or not any hydrogen is purchased 
future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table shown above 

table of contents 
index to financial statements outlook prices for the company s primary products are often quite volatile 
a strong global economy during and the first half of  which fueled demand for energy  led to high prices for crude oil and refined petroleum products 
beginning in the second half of and continuing into early  crude oil prices fell precipitously from the highs at mid year as the worldwide economy started to show signs of improvement in  crude oil prices began to strengthen 
the change in the prices for crude oil is primarily attributable to the level of demand for energy 
in january  west texas intermediate crude oil traded in a band between and per barrel 
nymex natural gas has traded in a band of to per mmbtu 
refining and marketing margins were very weak in january and these operations in the us and uk were showing operating losses during this time 
the company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending based on these prices 
the company s capital expenditure budget for was prepared during the fall of and based on this budget capital expenditures are expected to be slightly above levels 
since the budget was approved by the company s board of directors  crude oil prices have generally been above the levels assumed in the budget  but north american natural gas prices have generally trailed the budgeted prices 
based on a recent review of capital expenditure projects  capital expenditures in are projected to total approximately billion 
of this amount  billion or about  is allocated for the exploration and production program 
geographically  e p capital is spread approximately as follows for the united states  for malaysia  for canada and for all other areas 
spending in the us is primarily associated with continued development of producing and nonproducing deepwater fields as well as for the company s gulf of mexico and eagle ford shale exploration programs 
in malaysia  the majority of the spending is for continued development of natural gas fields in blocks sk and sk offshore sarawak and at the kikeh and kakap fields in block k 
the bulk of canadian spending in will relate to natural gas developments at the tupper and tupper west areas in western canada 
other spending is primarily in republic of the congo for continued development of the azurite offshore field 
refining and marketing expenditures in should be about million  or of the company total  including funds for construction of additional us retail gasoline stations and final costs for an expansion of crude throughput capacity at the milford haven  wales refinery 
capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed during and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year 
capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases  which often are not anticipated at the time the budget is prepared 
the company will primarily fund its capital program in using operating cash flow  but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities 
the company s budget calls for no increase in long term debt during the year  but if oil and or natural gas prices weaken or refining and marketing margins remain weak actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced to such a level that borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the company s ongoing development projects 
as noted earlier  north american natural gas prices in early were below the levels assumed in the budget 
also  through early  margins within the company s refining and marketing operations were significantly below amounts assumed in the company s budget 
the company currently expects production in to average slightly more than  barrels of oil equivalent per day 
a key assumption in projecting the level of company production is the anticipated ramp up of natural gas production from fields at tupper in western canada and sarawak  offshore malaysia  and ramp up of oil production from the thunder hawk field in the gulf of mexico and the azurite field offshore republic of the congo 
in addition  continued reliability of production at significant fields such as kikeh  syncrude  hibernia and terra nova are necessary to achieve the anticipated production levels

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates  prices of crude oil  natural gas and petroleum products  and foreign currency exchange rates 
as described in note a to the consolidated financial statements  murphy makes limited use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
there were short term derivative foreign exchange contracts in place at december  to hedge the value of us dollars against two foreign currencies 
a strengthening of the us dollar against these foreign currencies would have reduced the recorded net asset associated with these contracts by approximately million  while a weakening of the us dollar would have increased the recorded net asset by approximately million 
changes in the fair value of these derivative contracts generally offset the financial statement impact of an equivalent volume of foreign currency exposures associated with other assets and or liabilities
