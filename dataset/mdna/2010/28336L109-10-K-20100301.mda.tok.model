item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our management s discussion and analysis md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying footnotes 
md a includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may result in actual results differing from the statements we make 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed further in item a  risk factors 
listed below is a general outline of our md a our business includes a summary of our business purpose and description  factors influencing profitability  a summary of our performance and an outlook for  results of operations includes a year over year analysis of the results of our business segments  our corporate activities and other income statement items  including trends that may impact our business in the future  liquidity and capital resources includes a general discussion of our sources and uses of cash  available liquidity  our liquidity outlook for  an overview of cash flow activity during  and additional factors that could impact our liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations  and commodity based derivative contracts includes a discussion of our i off balance sheet arrangements  including guarantees and letters of credit  ii other contractual obligations  and iii derivative contracts used to manage the price risks associated with our natural gas and oil production  and critical accounting estimates includes a discussion of accounting estimates that involve the use of significant assumptions and or judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
our business our business purpose is to provide natural gas and related energy products in a safe  efficient and dependable manner 
we own or have interests in north america s largest interstate natural gas pipeline systems  which provide a stable base of earnings and cash flow with a significant backlog of committed expansion projects 
we are also a large independent natural gas and oil producer focused on generating competitive financial returns through disciplined capital allocation and portfolio management  cost control and marketing and selling our natural gas and oil production at optimal prices while managing associated price risks 
factors influencing our profitability 
our pipeline operations are rate regulated and accordingly we generate profit based on our ability to earn a return in excess of our costs through the rates we charge our customers 
our exploration and production operations generate profits dependent on the prices for natural gas and oil  our costs to explore  develop  and produce natural gas and oil  and the volumes we are able to produce  among other factors 
our long term profitability in each of our operating segments will be primarily influenced by the following factors pipelines successfully executing on our remaining backlog of committed expansion projects on time and on budget and developing new growth projects in our market and supply areas  contracting and recontracting pipeline capacity with our customers  maintaining or obtaining approval by the ferc of acceptable rates  terms of service  and expansion projects  and improving operating efficiency 

table of contents exploration and production growing our natural gas and oil proved reserve base and production volumes through successful drilling programs  finding and producing natural gas and oil at a reasonable cost  and managing price risks to optimize realized prices on our natural gas and oil production 
in addition to these factors  our future profitability will also be affected by any impacts of the volatility in the financial and commodity markets  our debt level and related interest costs  the successful resolution of our historical contingencies and completing the orderly exit of our remaining power assets  historical derivative contracts and other remaining non core assets 
summary of financial and operational performance during  we generated significant operating cash flows from our core pipeline and exploration and production businesses while executing on our plan outlined in late to respond to the volatility in the financial markets  energy industry and the global economy 
during  we placed several pipeline expansion projects into service  obtained a partner on our ruby project and secured financing for a portion of our remaining pipeline backlog 
in our exploration and production business  despite a lower level of drilling activity  lower natural gas prices and lower capital spending in  we expanded our resource inventory with low risk onshore reserves  lowered our operating costs  and managed our exposure to a volatile commodity price environment through an expanded hedging program through however  due to lower natural gas prices at the end of the first quarter of  we recorded approximately billion of non cash ceiling test charges  primarily on our domestic full cost pool  which significantly impacted our overall financial results 
we believe the stability of our pipeline earnings coupled with the hedging program in our exploration and production business will continue to protect our earnings base and cash flows from operations 
additionally  we believe we have managed our capital program to provide for our pipeline backlog while retaining substantially all of our existing natural gas and oil resource positions for future exploration and production activities 
the following table provides operational highlights in our core businesses area of operations significant highlights pipelines continued to make progress on our backlog of expansion projects placing four growth projects in service on budget  including the carthage expansion  the totem gas storage project  the wic piceance lateral expansion  and the concord lateral expansion obtained a percent partner for our ruby pipeline project and completed billion of financings to partially fund our pipeline backlog successfully settled the sng rate case with contract extensions through august and a rate moratorium until september exploration and production achieved an overall domestic drilling success rate of percent shifted focus to more unconventional resource plays domestically including the haynesville shale in northwest louisiana and east texas  the eagle ford shale in south texas and the altamont bluebell cedar rim field fractured tight sands in utah brought camarupim project on line in brazil and found hydrocarbons in two wells drilled in egypt managed price risk through derivative contracts on  and natural gas production as well as our and oil production in our non core power segment  we completed the sale of our interests in the porto velho power generation facility and the argentina to chile pipeline to our partners in these projects 
in october  we also announced our re entry into the midstream business where we believe that the movement to more unconventional supply basins will present future opportunities 

table of contents outlook for we expect that our pipeline operations will continue to provide a strong base of earnings and operating cash flow in we expect to have relatively stable rates within our pipeline group  with the majority of our pipelines not having any outstanding rate cases pending before the ferc 
we have also increased our capital expenditure program for this business to approximately billion and have a backlog of growth projects which we will remain focused on implementing both on time and on budget 
we currently plan to place three more projects in service by the end of however  the largest portion of our capital program is related to the anticipated construction of our ruby pipeline project 
finally  we will consider additional opportunities with our master limited partnership mlp  epb  as the markets permit 
in our exploration and production business  we also expect to generate significant operating cash flow and earnings  although additional non cash ceiling test charges could impact our earnings in the future as a result of future declines in natural gas and oil prices 
we anticipate spending approximately billion in capital expenditures in this business during  with approximately one half of the domestic capital program targeted for our haynesville  altamont and eagle ford areas and million planned for our brazil and egypt programs 
our planned average daily production for is expected to range between mmcfe d and mmcfe d  including approximately mmcfe d to mmcfe d from our ownership interest in the production of four star 
although commodity prices remain at lower levels  we have expanded our financial derivative contracts in place for providing average floors on approximately percent of our estimated consolidated natural gas production and average floors on approximately percent of our estimated consolidated oil production 
these contracts also allow for potential upside 
as of december   we had approximately billion of available liquidity 
in  we have an estimated billion capital program which provides for funding our pipeline backlog as well as exploration and production reserves growth 
our capital program consists of billion related to our pipeline business including of ruby pipeline capital and approximately billion related to our exploration and production business 
while our pipeline capital requirements are significant  our requirements decline significantly and by the end of most of our backlog will be placed in service 
accordingly  in  we expect to benefit from the earnings generated from our substantially completed pipeline backlog and greater exploration and production volumes 
in  our debt maturities are nominal 
we believe we are well positioned to meet our obligations based on the anticipated performance of our core businesses  our financing actions taken to date and planned for  and the additional steps noted below to enhance our liquidity 
for a further discussion  see liquidity and capital resources 
in november  we announced additional steps we would take to further improve our financial flexibility to fund our core businesses 
the additional steps are designed to i provide incremental funding for our capital programs focused on our industry leading pipeline backlog of growth opportunities and growing our unconventional natural gas drilling inventory in our exploration and production business  ii improve our overall cost structure  iii protect our credit profile  iv manage commodity risk and v enhance overall shareholder returns 
these steps were a reduction of million in annual operating and administrative expenses achieved primarily by reducing internal costs and improving efficiencies from leveraging a consolidated supply chain organization  a portion of which was realized in the sale of million to million of assets during in february  we entered into an agreement to sell our interest in mexican pipeline and compression assets for approximately million  and a reduction in our quarterly dividend from per share to per share  which will result in annual cash savings of approximately million 
we will continue to assess and take further actions where prudent to meet our long term objectives and capital requirements as well as address further changes in the financial and commodity markets 

table of contents results of operations overview as of december   our core operating business segments were pipelines and exploration and production 
we also have a marketing segment that markets our natural gas and oil production and manages our legacy trading activities and a power segment that has interests in power and pipeline assets in south america and asia 
our segments are managed separately  provide a variety of energy products and services  and require different technology and marketing strategies 
our corporate activities include our general and administrative functions  as well as other miscellaneous businesses  contracts and assets all of which are immaterial 
our management uses earnings before interest expense and income taxes ebit as a measure to assess the operating results and effectiveness of our business segments  which consist of both consolidated businesses and investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
we believe ebit is useful to our investors because it allows them to evaluate more effectively our operating performance using the same performance measure analyzed internally by our management 
we define ebit as net income loss adjusted for items such as i interest and debt expense  ii income taxes  and iii net income attributable to noncontrolling interests so that our investors may evaluate our operating results without regard to our financing methods or capital structure 
ebit may not be comparable to measures used by other companies 
additionally  ebit should be considered in conjunction with net income loss  income loss before income taxes and other performance measures such as operating income or operating cash flows 
below is a reconciliation of our ebit by segment to our consolidated net income loss for each of the three years ended december in millions segment pipelines exploration and production marketing power segment ebit corporate and other consolidated ebit interest and debt expense income tax benefit expense discontinued operations  net of income taxes net income loss attributable to el paso corporation net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income loss ebit represents ebit from continuing operations 
the discussions that follow provide additional analysis of the year over year results of each of our business segments  our corporate activities and other income statement items 

table of contents pipelines segment overview our pipelines segment operates primarily in the united states and consists of interstate natural gas transmission  storage and lng terminalling related services 
we face varying degrees of competition in this segment from other existing and proposed pipelines and proposed lng facilities  as well as from alternative energy sources used to generate electricity  such as hydroelectric power  nuclear energy  wind  solar  coal and fuel oil 
our revenues from transportation  storage  lng terminalling and related services consist of two types percent of type description revenues reservation reservation revenues are from customers referred to as firm customers that reserve capacity on our pipeline systems  storage facilities or lng terminalling facilities 
these firm customers are obligated to pay a monthly reservation or demand charge  regardless of the amount of natural gas they transport or store  for the term of their contracts 
usage and other usage revenues are from both firm customers and interruptible customers those without reserved capacity that pay usage charges based on the volume of gas actually transported  stored  injected or withdrawn 
we also earn revenues from the processing and sale of natural gas liquids and other miscellaneous sources 
the ferc regulates the rates we can charge our customers 
these rates are generally a function of the cost of providing services to our customers  including a reasonable return on our invested capital 
because of our regulated nature and the high percentage of our revenues attributable to reservation charges  our revenues have historically been relatively stable 
however  our financial results can be subject to volatility due to factors such as changes in natural gas prices  changes in supply and demand  regulatory actions  competition  weather and declines in the creditworthiness of our customers 
we also experience earnings volatility at certain pipelines when the amount of natural gas used in our operations differs from the amounts we receive for that purpose 
historically  much of our business was conducted through long term contracts with customers 
however  many of our customers have shifted from a traditional dependence on long term contracts to a portfolio approach  which balances short term opportunities with long term commitments 
this shift  which can increase the volatility of our revenues  is due to changes in market conditions and competition driven by state utility deregulation  local distribution company mergers  new supply sources  volatility in natural gas prices  demand for short term capacity and new power plant markets 
we continue to manage the process of renewing expiring contracts to limit the risk of significant impacts on our revenues 
our ability to extend existing customer contracts or remarket expiring contracted capacity is dependent on competitive alternatives  the regulatory environment at the federal  state and local levels and the market supply and demand factors at the relevant dates these contracts are extended or expire 
the duration of new or renegotiated contracts will be affected by current prices  competitive conditions and judgments concerning future market trends and volatility 
subject to regulatory requirements  we attempt to recontract or remarket our capacity at the maximum rates allowed under our tariffs  although at times  we enter into firm transportation contracts at amounts that are less than these maximum rates to remain competitive 
we refer to the difference between the maximum rates allowed under our tariff and the contractual rate we charge as discounts 
our existing contracts mature at various times and in varying amounts of throughput capacity 
the weighted average remaining contract term for our active contracts is approximately five years as of december  
table of contents below are the contract expiration portfolio and the associated revenue expirations for our firm transportation contracts on our wholly and majority owned systems as of december   including those with terms beginning in or later contracted capacity percent of total bbtu d percent of total reservation revenue reservation revenue in millions and beyond total summary of operational and financial performance in  we continued to deliver strong operational and financial performance across all pipelines benefitting from several expansion projects placed in service 
these projects included the carthage expansion in may  totem gas storage in june  the wic piceance lateral expansion in september  and the concord lateral expansion in october 
we continue to make significant progress on our remaining backlog of expansion projects 
in  epb issued additional public common units and used the proceeds primarily to acquire additional interests in cig 
at december   our ownership interest in epb consisted of a two percent general partner interest and a percent limited partner interest 
during  we plan to spend billion in capital on our pipeline business  including billion on our backlog of expansion projects 
our most significant projects are listed below grouped by anticipated in service dates

elba expansion iii vaporization and elba express in service dates are march and elba expansion iii storage in service date is august this expansion consists of two projects 
these projects have substantial contractual commitments with customers but are not fully contracted 
amount includes percent of our ruby pipeline project expenditures 
as of december   we have received million and anticipate obtaining approximately million of funding in total from our equity partner on this project 
amounts represent our share of the estimated costs for these unconsolidated affiliates 
amount includes approximately million that we paid to acquire a percent interest in this project 

table of contents listed below is additional information related to our significant backlog projects elba expansion iii elba express cypress phase iii 
during the second quarter of  bg lng services llc bg and sng  elba express and southern lng  inc entered into agreements to delay the in service date of the elba expansion iii phase b project at bg s option  to as late as december   or  in the event certain conditions are unable to be met by bg  to terminate the elba expansion iii phase b project 
in exchange for this delay termination option  bg has committed to subscribe to certain firm phase b capacity on our elba express pipeline and to provide certain rate considerations on an existing transportation contract on our sng pipeline 
in addition  bg has given up its right to proceed with phase iii of the cypress expansion project on sng 
phase a of both the elba expansion iii vaporization facilities and the elba express project are expected to commence commercial operations in march wic expansion 
wic expanded the scope of this project to add a second compressor unit on the kanda lateral due to increased shipper commitments 
this portion of the project will add a  horsepower compressor station on the kanda lateral which will increase the capacity on this lateral to mdth d 
wic also plans to install three miles of pipeline and reconfigure one compressor at its wamsutter station which will provide mdth d natural gas deliveries from the wic mainline into a third party pipeline and onto the opal hub and the proposed ruby pipeline 
ruby pipeline project 
we expect that the ruby pipeline project will consist of approximately miles of pipeline and multiple compressor stations with total horsepower of approximately  however  final sizing will be based on market support 
in september  we received a preliminary determination from the ferc on non environmental issues related to this project 
in january  the ferc issued a final environmental impact statement eis related to our ruby project 
subject to ferc and other approvals  the project is expected to commence construction in the first half of and is anticipated to be placed in service during the first quarter of fgt phase viii project 
in september  the ferc issued a final eis 
we also received the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration special permit from the department of transportation in order to operate the pipeline at higher operating pressures 
in november  the ferc approved this project 
gulf lng 
in february  we completed our acquisition of a percent interest in the gulf lng clean energy project  which is constructing a ferc approved lng terminal in pascagoula  mississippi with a designed sendout capacity of bcf d that is expected to be placed in service in october tgp line expansion 
all of the firm transportation capacity resulting from this project in the northeast us market area is fully subscribed with one shipper based on a precedent agreement which was executed in the third quarter of an environmental assessment is expected to be issued by the ferc in the first quarter of south system ii southeast supply header 
the south system ii expansion project will expand sng s pipeline system in mississippi  alabama and georgia by adding approximately miles of pipeline looping and replacement on sng s south system and  of horsepower compression to serve an existing power generation facility in the atlanta  georgia area 
this project will be completed in three phases with each phase expected to add an additional mmcf d of capacity 
the southeast supply header is expected to provide access through pipeline interconnects to several supply basins  including the barnett shale  bossier sands  arkoma and fayetteville shale basins and is expected to provide sng with an additional mmcf d of supply capacity 
tgp northeast upgrade project 
in february  tgp entered into precedent agreements with two shippers to provide  mmbtu d of additional firm transportation service from receipt points in the marcellus shale basin to an interconnect in new jersey 
in order to accommodate the additional service  we will pursue northeast upgrade project which includes approximately miles of pipeline looping and approximately  horsepower of additional compression 
the expected cost for this project is million and construction is anticipated to be placed in service by november 
table of contents successful execution on our committed pipeline backlog will continue to require effective project management 
in addition to securing a partner for the ruby pipeline project in  we have significantly mitigated the risk associated with our remaining backlog by subscribing approximately percent of the capacity of our aggregate backlog under contract terms of to years primarily with investment grade customers and purchasing or committing to purchase steel at fixed prices for all of our largest projects as well as contracting a significant portion of the construction costs 
in addition to our current backlog of contracted organic growth projects  we have other potential projects that are in various phases of commercial development 
many of these projects involve expansion capacity to serve increased natural gas fired generation loads  as well as new supply projects 
most of our potential expansion projects would have in service dates for and beyond 
if we are successful in contracting for these new projects  the capital requirements could be substantial and would be incremental to our current projects 
although we pursue the development of these and other potential projects from time to time  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating the definitive binding contracts necessary for such projects 
potential power plant loads 
similar to sng s south system iii project  we are pursuing various expansion projects particularly in the southeastern portion of the united states us to serve increased natural gas fired generation loads 
in addition  along the front range of cig s system  utilities have various projects under development that involve constructing new natural gas fired generation in part to provide backup capacity required when renewable generation is not available during certain daily or seasonal periods

expansions 
during and  our reservation revenues and throughput volumes increased due to the projects placed in service 
during and  we placed the carthage expansion project  the totem gas storage facility  the concord lateral expansion  the wic piceance lateral expansion  the wic kanda lateral project  phase ii of the cypress project  the cheyenne plains compression expansion project  phase i of the southeast supply header project  the medicine bow expansion and the high plains pipeline projects in service 
reservation and usage revenues 
during the year ended december  compared with  our reservation and usage revenues were also impacted by increased revenues for the mainline and lateral capacity on our rocky mountain region systems primarily due to new contracts and restructured contract terms  additional capacity sales of approximately million primarily from the marcellus basin in the northeast market area of our tgp system  increased reservation and other services revenues of approximately million primarily on our sng system due to higher tariff rates effective september  pursuant to sng s rate case settlement further discussed below  higher reservation charges of approximately million for capacity on our epng system resulting from increased contracted capacity to primary delivery points in california and an increase in epng s tariff rates effective january   subject to refund  and unfavorable usage revenue of approximately million due to decreased activity under various interruptible services and lower demand at the southeast interconnects resulting from increased competition on our tgp system 

table of contents for the year ended december   our throughput volumes on the tgp and epng systems decreased compared with this was due  in part  to general weakness in natural gas demand in the united states  including in the northeast and southwest 
although fluctuations in throughput on our pipeline systems have a limited effect on our short term results since a material portion of our revenues are derived from firm reservation charges  it can be an indication of the risks we may face when seeking to recontract or renew any of our existing firm transportation contracts 
continuing negative economic impacts on demand  as well as adverse shifting of sources of supply  could negatively impact basis differentials and our ability to renew firm transportation contracts that are expiring on our system or our ability to renew such contracts at current rates 
if we determine there is a significant change in our costs or billing determinants on any of our pipeline systems  we will have the option to file rate cases on certain of our pipelines with the ferc to recover our prudently incurred costs 
for the year ended december  compared with  the increase in our reservation and usage revenues was primarily due to approximately million related to increased demand for off system and mainline capacity on our rocky mountain region systems primarily due to lower natural gas prices in the rocky mountains as compared to other regions in the united states  approximately million related to additional firm capacity sold in the northern and southern regions of our tgp system  partially offset by lower surcharges from certain firm customers on this system  approximately million related to increased reservation and usage revenues on our epng system due to higher amounts charged on recontracted capacity in arizona and california  and approximately million related to additional interruptible and firm commodity services provided in several of our pipeline systems 
gas not used in operations and revaluations 
during the year ended december   our overall ebit was million favorable when compared with  primarily due to retained fuel volumes in excess of fuel used in operations  higher realized prices on operational sales  lower electric compression utilization  and lower index prices related to fuel imbalance revaluations  settlement and other gas balance related items 
in addition  during  cig and wic recorded cost and revenue tracker adjustments associated with the implementation of fuel and related gas cost recovery mechanisms  which the ferc approved subject to the outcome of technical conferences 
the implementation of these mechanisms was protested by a limited number of shippers 
on july  and october   the ferc issued orders to cig and wic  respectively  directing them to remove the cost and revenue components from their fuel recovery mechanisms 
additionally  on october   epng received an order from the ferc directing epng to remove the cost and revenue component of its fuel recovery mechanism 
epng s compliance filing to remove the cost and revenue component was approved in the fourth quarter of our future earnings may be impacted positively or negatively depending on fluctuations in gas prices related to the revaluation of epng s under or over recoveries  imbalances and system encroachments 
epng s tariff continues to provide that the difference between the quantity of fuel retained and fuel used in operations and lost and unaccounted for will be flowed through or charged to shippers 
we continue to explore options to minimize the price volatility associated with these operational pipeline activities 
during the year ended december  compared with the same period in  our ebit was favorably impacted by million due to higher volumes of gas not used in our tgp operations 
bankruptcy proceeds 
during  our revenue increased by million related to calpine corporation s calpine s rejection of its transportation contracts with us primarily associated with distributions received under calpine s approved plan of reorganization 
during and  we recorded income of approximately million and million  net of amounts potentially owed to certain customers  related to amounts recovered from the enron bankruptcy settlement 
in  we received million to settle our bankruptcy claim against usgen new england  inc 
table of contents operating and general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   our operating and general and administrative expenses were lower than in primarily due to million of decreased field repair and maintenance expense on several of our pipeline systems 
partially offsetting these cost reductions were severance costs of approximately million 
during the year ended december   our operating and general and administrative expenses were higher than in primarily due to increased labor costs of approximately million to support our growth and customer activities and approximately million in additional maintenance work required on several of our pipeline systems 
gain loss on long lived assets 
during  we recorded a gain of million related to the sale of cig s natural buttes compressor station and gas processing plant 
during  we recorded impairments of million  including an impairment related to our essex middlesex lateral project due to a prolonged permitting process and an impairment of our epng arizona gas storage projects that we are no longer developing due to declining real estate values 
during  we recorded i a million impairment of certain pipeline assets originally purchased to repair certain offshore hurricane damage following a decision not to use these assets  ii a loss of approximately million on epng s east valley line lateral pursuant to a ferc determination on the accounting treatment for the pending sale of certain transmission facilities and iii a million pre tax gain on the sale of a pipeline lateral 
hurricanes 
during  we incurred damage to sections of our gulf coast and offshore pipeline facilities due to hurricanes ike and gustav 
our ebit was unfavorably impacted by million in due to repair costs and million in related to these hurricanes due to gas loss from various damaged pipelines  lower volume of gas not used in operations  and repair costs that did not exceed self retention levels 
equity earnings from citrus 
in  equity earnings on our citrus investment decreased as compared to primarily due to citrus s favorable settlement in of approximately million for litigation brought against spectra lng sales formerly duke energy lng sales  inc for the wrongful termination of a gas supply contract and citrus sale of a receivable in for approximately million related to the bankruptcy of enron north america 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
our net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased during and due to i the additional public common units issued by our majority owned mlp in july and ii our contribution to our mlp of additional interests in cig percent in july and percent in september and sng percent in september 
as of december   our mlp owned percent of cig  percent of sng and percent of wic and we owned percent of the mlp 
other regulatory matters 
our pipeline systems periodically file for changes in their rates  which are subject to the approval by the ferc 
changes in rates and other tariff provisions resulting from these regulatory proceedings have the potential to positively or negatively impact our profitability 
currently  while certain of our pipelines are expected to continue operating under their existing rates  other pipelines have projected upcoming rate actions with anticipated effective dates from through in january  the ferc approved sng s settlement in which sng i increased its base tariff rates  ii implemented a volume tracker for gas used in operations  iii agreed to file its next general rate case to be effective after august  but no later than september   and iv extended the vast majority of sng s firm transportation contracts until august  in june  epng filed a rate case with the ferc as required under the settlement of its previous rate case 
the filing proposed an increase in epng s base tariff rates 
in august  the ferc issued an order accepting the proposed rates effective january   subject to refund and the outcome of a hearing and a technical conference 
the ferc issued an order in december that generally accepted most of epng s proposals in the technical conference proceeding 
the ferc has appointed an administrative law judge to preside over a hearing if epng is unable to reach a negotiated settlement with its customers on the remaining issues 
settlement negotiations are continuing  however  the hearing has been postponed until may the outcome of the settlement discussions and the hearing is not currently determinable 

table of contents exploration and production segment overview and strategy our exploration and production segment conducts our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities 
the profitability and performance of this segment are driven by the ability to locate and develop economic natural gas and oil reserves and extract those reserves at the lowest possible production and administrative costs 
accordingly  we manage this business with the goal of creating value through disciplined capital allocation  cost control and portfolio management 
our strategy focuses on building and applying competencies in assets with repeatable programs  executing to improve capital and expense efficiency  and maximizing returns by adding assets and inventory that match our competencies and divesting assets that do not 
during  in the us  we shifted our focus to more unconventional resource plays including the haynesville shale in northwest louisiana and east texas  the eagle ford shale in south texas and the altamont bluebell cedar rim field fractured tight sands in utah 
our domestic natural gas and oil reserve portfolio blends lower decline rate  typically longer lived assets in our central and western divisions  with steeper decline rate  shorter lived assets in our gulf coast division 
approximately percent of our capital was spent on domestic projects 
internationally  our portfolio consists of producing fields along with several exploration and development projects in offshore brazil and exploration projects in egypt 
our international capital  primarily in brazil  constituted approximately percent of our total capital program 
success of our international programs in brazil and egypt will require effective project management  strong partner relations and obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
during  the challenging commodity price environment resulted in ceiling test charges totaling billion 
coupled with unprecedented challenges in the credit markets  we also reduced our capital spending during we continue to evaluate acquisition and growth opportunities that are focused on our core competencies and areas of competitive advantage 
strategic acquisitions  like the one we completed in december of natural gas and oil properties in the altamont bluebell cedar rim field in utah  can support our corporate objectives  providing us greater opportunities to achieve our long term performance goals by leveraging operational expertise already possessed in key operating areas  balancing our exposure to regions  basins and commodities  achieving risk adjusted returns competitive with those available within our existing inventory  and increasing our reserves by supplementing our current drilling inventory 
in addition to effectively executing on our strategy  our profitability and performance is impacted by i changes in commodity prices  ii industry wide changes in the cost of drilling and oilfield services  and iii the effect of hurricanes and other weather impacts on our daily production  operating  and capital costs 
to the extent possible  we attempt to mitigate these factors 
as part of our risk management activities  we maintain derivative contracts to reduce the financial impact of downward commodity price movements 

table of contents significant operational factors affecting the year ended december  production 
our average daily production for the year was mmcfe d  including mmcfe d from our equity interest in the production of four star 
below is an analysis of our production by division mmcfe d united states central western gulf coast international brazil total consolidated four star total combined central division our central division production volumes continued to increase as a result of our successful arklatex drilling programs including the haynesville shale 
in the haynesville shale  we drilled wells during the year and had average net production of approximately mmcfe d 
at december   we had operated wells producing at a rate of approximately mmcfe d 
western division our western division production volumes were flat as compared to primarily due to the successful drilling programs in the altamont bluebell cedar rim field offset by natural declines in the rockies 
gulf coast division our gulf coast division production volumes decreased primarily due to sales of assets in and early in this division  our focus was on increasing our eagle ford shale acreage  where we hold approximately  net acres as of december  and drilled our first well which was successful 
brazil in brazil  our production volumes were up slightly from production from natural declines in our pescada arabiana fields was more than offset by new production from our camarupim field  where we began production in the fourth quarter of drilling results central 
we achieved a percent success rate on gross wells drilled 
western 
we achieved a percent success rate on seven gross wells drilled 
gulf coast 
we achieved an percent success rate on gross wells drilled 
brazil 
we achieved a percent success rate on four gross wells drilled 
egypt 
hydrocarbons were found in two of five or percent of the gross exploratory wells we drilled or participated in drilling 
for a further discussion of our activities in brazil and egypt  see part i  item  business  exploration and production segment  international 
cash operating costs 
we monitor cash operating costs required to produce our natural gas and oil production volumes 
cash operating costs is a non gaap measure calculated on a per mcfe basis and includes total operating expenses less depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  ceiling test and other impairment charges  transportation costs and cost of products 
cash operating costs per unit is a valuable measure of operating performance and efficiency for the exploration and production segment 

table of contents during the year ended december   cash operating costs per unit decreased to mcfe as compared to mcfe in the decrease in is primarily due to lower lease operating expenses and production taxes partially offset by lower production volumes in versus reserve replacement ratio reserve replacement costs 
we calculate two primary metrics  i a reserve replacement ratio and ii reserve replacement costs  to measure our ability to establish a long term trend of adding reserves at a reasonable cost in our core asset areas 
the reserve replacement ratio is an indicator of our ability to replenish annual production volumes and grow our reserves 
it is important for us to economically find and develop new reserves that will more than offset produced volumes and provide for future production given the inherent decline of hydrocarbon reserves 
in addition  we calculate reserve replacement costs to assess the cost of adding reserves  which is ultimately included in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
we believe the ability to develop a competitive advantage over other natural gas and oil companies is dependent on adding reserves in our core asset areas at lower costs than our competition 
we calculate these metrics as follows reserve replacement ratio sum of reserve additions actual production for the corresponding period reserve replacement costs mcfe total oil and gas capital costs sum of reserve additions reserve additions include proved reserves and reflect reserve revisions for prices and performance  extensions  discoveries and other additions and acquisitions and do not include unproved reserve quantities or proved reserve additions attributable to investments accounted for using the equity method 
we present these metrics separately  both including and excluding the impact of price revisions on reserves  to demonstrate the effectiveness of our drilling program exclusive of economic factors such as price outside of our control 
all amounts are derived directly from the table presented in
