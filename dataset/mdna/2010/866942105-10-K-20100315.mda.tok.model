the company sells its products globally through wholly owned subsidiaries and independent distributors 
sales outside the united states for the year ended january   were approximately of total net sales 
approximately two thirds of product sales are used by the mobile market  which is characterized by applications where the equipment is not fixed in place  the operating environment is often unpredictable  and duty cycles are generally moderate to low 
some examples of the mobile market include equipment used in off road construction  agriculture  fire and rescue  utilities  oil fields  and mining 
the remaining one third of sales are used by industrial markets  which are characterized by equipment that is fixed in place  typically in a controlled environment  and which operates at higher pressures and duty cycles 
power units  automation machinery  metal cutting machine tools and plastics machinery are some examples of industrial equipment 
the company sells to both markets with a single product line 
industry conditions demand for the company s products is dependent on demand for the capital goods into which the products are incorporated 
the capital goods industries in general  and the fluid power industry specifically  are subject to economic cycles 
according to the national fluid power association the fluid power industry s trade association in the united states  the united states index of shipments of hydraulic products decreased in after increasing and  in and  respectively 
the company s order trend has historically tracked closely to the united states purchasing managers index pmi 
the index increased to in december  from a low of in december pmi increased throughout and moved above in august  indicating an expanding economy 
the index was in february  which was the seventh consecutive month with a pmi above the portions of the index that represent new orders and production have shown growth for eight and nine consecutive months  respectively 
management believes these trends are a strong indication of growing demand 
results for the fiscal year dollars in millions except net income per share january  december  decrease twelve months ended net sales net income net income per share basic diluted three months ended net sales net income net income per share basic diluted the fourth quarter finished strong  resulting in sequential quarterly growth since the second quarter 
sun s order rates  capital goods inventory conditions  and indicators like pmi and capacity utilization are all improving 
this leads management to believe that the worst of last year s recession is over and it expects that the first quarter will show continued improvement 
management is pleased to have remained profitable for  the th consecutive year of profitability  despite a drop in revenues of 
the company did this without sacrificing its capacity or capabilities 
the company continued to make capital investments  develop and release new products  and  perhaps most critical  maintain workforce readiness 
in june  sun initiated rolling furloughs for the production workforce and a salary reduction for non production personnel 
the furloughs allow the company to balance its capacity with current business levels without compromising its ability to respond when demand increases 
the furlough model  was designed so that it is relatively simple to return to normal work schedules as demand recovers 
with the increased demand seen early in  approximately of production employees have been removed from the furloughs 
throughout  the company experienced high levels of expedited order activity of approximately of orders 
management is pleased to report that while expedited orders are still high  they are not as high as last year 
that tells us that inventory has stabilized and things are coming into balance 
management is encouraged by customer inquiries and the prototype activity that it experienced at all sun locations 
some prototypes have led to production orders 
management is confident that its prototype activities will continue to drive new business 
management believes market share gains are taken on the upturn of the cycle by those companies that are able to respond to the market demand and opportunities created 
sun s depth and breadth of products  its ability to provide complete systems solutions  and deliver reliably will allow it to gain share during this recovery 
maintaining the company s strong balance sheet and financial flexibility remains a key strategy 
the company ended with cash and investments of million  up million from the previous year  an unused line of credit of million  and zero dollars of long term debt

critical accounting policies and estimates the company currently only applies judgment and estimates which may have a material effect on the eventual outcome of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses for impairment of long lived assets  accounts receivable  inventory  goodwill  accruals  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
the following explains the basis and the procedure for each account where judgment and estimates are applied 
revenue recognition the company reports revenues  net of sales incentives  when title passes and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
the effect of material non recurring events related to product liabilities is provided for when they become known 
the company has not experienced any material product liabilities in the past 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
accounts receivable the company sells to most of its customers on a recurring basis  primarily through distributors with which the company maintains long term relationships 
as a result  bad debt experience has not been material 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined on a specific identification basis by a review of those accounts that are significantly in arrears 
there can be no assurance that a distributor or a large direct sale customer with overdue accounts receivable balances will not develop financial difficulties and default on payment 
see consolidated balance sheets for allowance amounts 
inventory the company offers a wide variety of standard products and as a matter of policy does not discontinue products 
on an ongoing basis  component parts found to be obsolete through design or process changes are disposed of and charged to material cost 
the company reviews on hand balances of products and component parts against specific criteria 
products and component parts without usage or that have excess quantities on hand are evaluated

there is no assurance that the value of the acquired company will not decrease in the future due to changing business conditions 
see note to the financial statements for goodwill amounts

estimates for employee benefit accruals are based on management s assessment of estimated liabilities related to workers compensation  health care benefits and annual contributions to an employee stock ownership plan esop  established in as part of the company s retirement plan

the company accrues for health care benefit costs under a self funded plan 
the company purchases re insurance for both specific and aggregate stop losses on claims that exceed thousand on an individual basis and approximately million on an aggregate basis 
stock based compensation all share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense in earnings over the requisite service period 
benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs are reported as a financing cash inflow 
income taxes the company s income tax policy provides for a liability approach under which deferred income taxes are provided for based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the taxes become payable 
these differences result from items reported differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes  primarily depreciation  accrued expenses and reserves
