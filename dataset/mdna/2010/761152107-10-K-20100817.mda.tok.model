we are a leading developer  manufacturer and distributor of medical equipment for treating  diagnosing  and managing sleep disordered breathing sdb and other respiratory disorders 
during the fiscal year  we continued our efforts to build awareness of the consequences of untreated sdb and to grow our business in this market 
in our efforts  we have attempted to raise awareness through market and clinical initiatives and by highlighting the increasing link between the potential effects sdb can have on cardiovascular diseases and type diabetes 
in september  the european society of cardiologists published guidelines for the treatment of acute and chronic heart failure 
the guidelines noted that patients with symptomatic heart failure frequently have sleep related disorders central or obstructive sleep apnea and recommended treatment with continuous positive airway pressure  or cpap  for patients diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnea 
in june  the international diabetes federation issued a consensus statement on sleep disordered breathing and type diabetes  where the substantial value of identifying and treating diabetic patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing was recognized and recommended 
the national institutes of health released a clinical study in april reporting that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of stroke in middle aged and older adults  especially men 
in a recently released study in circulation  it was reported that obstructive sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk of incident heart failure in a general community of middle aged and older men 
specifically  men ages to with ahi were more likely to develop coronary heart disease than those with ahi this is just one of many studies being conducted that provide new evidence that treating sleep disordered breathing and obstructive sleep apnea can improve health  quality of life and also mitigate the dangers of sleep apnea in occupational health and safety  especially in the transport industry 
we may experience continued growth from the increasing awareness of the relationship between sleep disordered breathing  obstructive sleep apnea and co morbidities such as cardiac disease  diabetes  hypertension and obesity 
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development and product enhancements 
during fiscal year  we invested approximately million on research and development activities  which represents of revenue 
since the development of cpap  we have developed a number of innovative products for the treatment of sdb and other respiratory disorders including airflow generators  diagnostic products  mask systems  headgear and other accessories

we have introduced new masks during fiscal  including the swift fx mask and the mirage softgel mask 
additionally  we released the s autoset and elite flow generators 
these products have an improved comfort and sleek  bedroom friendly design but most importantly have been developed to drive greater patient adherence to therapy

stock based compensation costs we have granted stock options and restricted stock units to personnel  including officers and directors  under the resmed inc incentive award plan the plan  the incentive award plan  
table of contents as amended the plan and the amended and restated resmed inc incentive award plan the amended plan 
these options and restricted stock units have expiration dates of seven years from the date of grant and vest over one or four years 
we granted the options with the exercise price equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant 
we have also offered to our personnel  including officers  the right to purchase shares of our common stock at a discount under the resmed inc employee stock purchase plan the espp 
we measure the compensation expense of all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  using the straight line method for stock based awards 
the fair value of restricted stock units is equal to the market value as determined at the date of grant 
the fair value of stock options granted under our stock option plans and purchase rights granted under the espp is estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model assuming no dividends and using the following assumptions years ended june stock options weighted average grant date fair value weighted average risk free interest rate dividend yield expected option life in years volatility espp purchase rights weighted average risk free interest rate dividend yield expected option life months months months volatility expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from traded options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options 
we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as we believe the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends 
while there is a tradable market of options on our common stock  less emphasis is placed on the implied volatility of these options due to the relative low volumes of these traded options and the difference in the terms compared to our employee options 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 
tax expense our income tax rate is governed by the laws of the regions in which our income is recognized 
to date  a substantial portion of our income has been subject to income tax in australia where the statutory rate was in fiscal years  and during fiscal years  and  our consolidated effective tax rate has fluctuated between approximately and approximately 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and future effective tax rates will depend upon  numerous factors  including the amount of research and development expenditures for which a an additional australian tax deduction is available  the geographic mix of taxable income and other tax credits or benefits available to us under applicable tax laws 

table of contents we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
critical accounting principles and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory adjustments  warranty obligations  goodwill  impaired assets  intangible assets  income taxes  deferred tax valuation allowances and stock based compensation costs 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
the estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering a customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined by the first in  first out method 
we review the components of inventory on a regular basis for excess  obsolete and impaired inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
the likelihood of any material inventory write downs is dependent on changes in competitive conditions  new product introductions by us or our competitors  or rapid changes in customer demand 
valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we use assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset  as well as the strategic significance of any identifiable intangible asset in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
factors that would influence the likelihood of a material change in our reported results include significant changes in the asset s ability to generate positive cash flow  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  a significant decline in the economic and competitive environment on which the asset depends  significant changes in our strategic business objectives  utilization of the asset  and a significant change in the economic and or political conditions in certain countries 

table of contents valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions that we operate in  and any significant changes in the tax treatment received on our business combinations 
provision for warranty 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
the amount of this provision is determined by using a financial model  which takes into consideration actual  historical expenses and potential risks associated with our different products 
this financial model is then used to calculate the future probable expenses related to warranty and the required level of the warranty provision 
although we engage in product improvement programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
should actual product failure rates or estimated costs to repair those product failures differ from our estimates  revisions to our estimated warranty provision would be required 
revenue recognition 
revenue on product sales is recorded at the time of shipment  at which time title transfers to the customer 
revenue on product sales which require customer acceptance is not recorded until acceptance is received 
royalty revenue from license agreements is recorded when earned 
service revenue received in advance from service contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the service contract 
revenue received in advance from rental unit contracts is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract 
revenue from rental unit contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the rental contract 
revenue from sale of marketing and distribution rights is initially deferred and recognized ratably as revenue over the life of the contract 
freight charges billed to customers are included in revenue 
all freight related expenses are charged to cost of sales 
we do not recognize revenues to the extent that we offer a right of return or other recourse with respect to the sale of our products or similarly offer variable sale prices for subsequent events or activities 
however  as part of our sales processes we may provide upfront discounts for large orders  one time special pricing to support new product introductions  sales rebates for centralized purchasing entities or price breaks for regular order volumes 
the costs of all such programs are recorded as an adjustment to revenue 
our products are predominantly therapy based equipment and require no installation 
as such  we have no significant installation obligations 
stock based compensation 
we measure the compensation of all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant 
such value is recognized as compensation expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption we use is based upon us treasury yield curve appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatilities of our stock and the implied volatilities from tradeable options of our stock corresponding to the expected term of the options 
we use a combination of the historic and implied volatilities as the addition of the implied volatility is more representative of our future stock price trends 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we have used historical rates by employee groups 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
the aforementioned inputs entered into the option valuation model we use to fair value our stock awards are subjective estimates and changes to 
table of contents these estimates will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock based compensation expense we record to vary
