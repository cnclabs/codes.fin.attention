we believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success and we are committed to maintaining a significant level of r d investment 
sales and distribution we sell our products to oems and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to oems or contract manufacturers 
we use dedicated global sales and marketing organizations as well as independent sales representatives to generate sales 
in general  we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts with independent sales representatives often addressing those customers in defined territories 
distributors create demand within the balance of our customer base 
distributors also provide vendor managed inventory  value added services and logistics for a wide range of our oem customers 
whether xilinx  the independent sales representative  or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity  a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders 
in such situations  distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear all legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods  such as credit loss  inventory shrinkage and theft  as well as foreign currency fluctuations  but excluding indemnity and warranty liability 
in accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice  we have granted the distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a subsequent change in list prices 
revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the distributors end customers 
avnet  inc avnet distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide 
no end customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal  or as of april  and march   avnet accounted for and of the company s total accounts receivable  respectively 
resale of product through avnet accounted for  and of the company s worldwide net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
we also use other regional distributors throughout the world 
we believe distributors provide a cost effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services 
since plds are standard products  they do not present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by asics  and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support 
from time to time  we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies  or move customers to a direct support model as we deem appropriate given our strategies  the level of business and distributor performance and financial condition 
for example  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we terminated our relationship with one of our north american based distributors
