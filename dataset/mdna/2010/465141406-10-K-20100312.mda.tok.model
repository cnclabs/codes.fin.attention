item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this form k 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify these forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend  or continue  and similar expressions 
these statements are only predictions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the united states 
our properties are primarily located in texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
we act as the operator of certain of these properties 
historically  we have grown through acquisitions  with a focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs 
our financial results depend upon many factors  but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire additional properties with existing production 
the amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices  which are affected by changes in market demand and supply  as impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors  and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities 
accordingly  finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long term success 
our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 
to the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods  our financial position  cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted 
at december   our estimated total proved oil  natural gas reserves and natural gas liquids  as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm  cawley  gillespie associates  inc  were approximately  thousand barrels of oil equivalent mboe  consisting of  thousand barrels bbls of oil  and  million cubic feet mcf of natural gas and  thousand barrels bbls natural gas liquids 
approximately of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
oil and natural gas activities accounting for oil and natural gas activities is subject to unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and natural gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of unsuccessful exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred upon a determination that the well is uneconomical  while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and natural gas properties against their estimated fair value  while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using period end prices and costs and a discount rate 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
proved oil and natural gas reserves our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and sec guidelines 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization and impairment expense 
proved oil and natural gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of i the quality and quantity of available data  ii the interpretation of that data  iii the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and iv the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir will also result in revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
depreciation  depletion and amortization our rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is primarily dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves  which is utilized in our unit of production method calculation 
if the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced  the rate at which we record dd a expense would increase  reducing net income 
such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices  which may make it non economic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves 

table of contents impairment we review our property and equipment in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  property  plant  and equipment asc 
asc requires us to evaluate property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value 
further  we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with our oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations we have will be take effect in the future 
additionally  these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the present value calculations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate removal cost amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of obligations and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next months 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts  which would potentially allow us to not record the change in fair value of our derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations 
we carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets  with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs 
our results of operations would potentially have been significantly different had we elected and qualified for hedge accounting on our derivative contracts 
income taxes the company follows asc  income taxes  asc  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the liability method based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided  if necessary  to reserve the amount of net operating loss and net deferred tax assets which the company may not be able to use because of the expiration of maximum carryover periods allowed under applicable tax codes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash during were cash flows from operating activities and loan from related party 
the capital markets  as they relate to us  have been adversely impacted by the current financial crisis  concerns about the economic recession and its effect on commodity prices 
continued volatility in the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to replace our reserves  and eventually  our production levels 
our future capital resources and liquidity may depend  in part  on our success in developing the leasehold interests that we have acquired 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves  which is typical in the capital intensive oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success in finding and acquiring additional reserves 
we expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows and borrowings under our senior credit agreements 
long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including the level of production and pricesand our commodity price hedging activities as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas industry 
debt as of december  in thousands except percentage revolving credit facility long term debt related party short term debt related party current maturities of long term debt  short term debt and bank overdraft total debt stockholders equity debt to capital ratio at year end  our total debt was  thousand compared to total debt of  thousand at year end and  thousand at year end as of december   current debt included  thousand as current maturities of the senior credit facility 
however  the company is not obligated to repay this facility prior to the due date  except for such payments as may be required under the credit agreement in the event of a redetermination and reduction of the borrowing base 
as of december   the  included as current maturities thousand was due to the decision of management to continue reducing the our debt below the borrowing base 
as of december   current debt included  thousand as current maturities  which again was due to management s decision to continue payments to reduce debt below the borrowing base 

table of contents cash flow our primary sources of cash in  and were from operating and financing activities 
proceeds from loans obtained from related parties  proceeds from the senior credit agreements and cash received from operations were offset by repayments of our senior credit agreements  repayments of loans from related parties and cash used in investing activities to fund continued enhancement of operations acquisition activities 
operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
working capital was substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures or influence our ability to reduce our long term loans 
prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years 
see results of continuing operations below for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales

key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes  heading activities and operating cost 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to a increase in our average daily production volumes and gain from net cash received on settled derivative contracts which was partially offset by the  and decrease in natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids prices  respectively 
however  we are unable to predict future production levels or future commodity prices  and  therefore  we cannot predict future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in compared to primarily due to the acquisition we made during investing activities  the primary component of cash used in investing activities in and was capital spending for acquisitions and development 
cash used in investing activities was thousand   thousand and  thousand for the years ended december   and  respectively

to assess the operating results of isramco  management analyzes income from operations before income taxes  interest expense  exploration expense  unrealized gain loss on derivative contracts and dd a expense and impairments adjusted ebitdax 
adjusted ebitdax is not a gaap measure 
isramco s definition of adjusted ebitdax excludes exploration expense because exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period  but rather is monitored by management as a part of the costs incurred in exploration and development activities 
similarly  isramco excludes dd a expense and impairments from adjusted ebitdax as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred 
the company s definition of adjusted ebitdax also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to isramco s financing methods or capital structure 
adjusted ebitdax is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make payments on its long term loans 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitdax provides information useful in assessing the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents however  adjusted ebitdax  as defined by isramco  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  isramco s consolidated adjusted ebitdax should be considered in conjunction with income loss from operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with gaap  such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitdax should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of isramco s results as reported under gaap

table of contents during  our operating expenses decreased by when compared to due to the following factors lease operating expense  transportation and taxes decreased by  or  thousand  in when compared to primarily as a result of cost savings programs initiated in response to the reduction in oil and gas prices experienced from into cost savings were achieved through operating efficiencies  deferral of certain workovers and vendor negotiations 
additional reductions were due to lower commodity prices that affected the taxes paid during this decrease was partially offset by the fact that  in  we recorded only months of operating expense  transportation and taxes associated with the properties acquired in gfb acquisition  compared to months during on a per unit basis  lease operating expenses including transportation and taxes decreased by per mboe to per mboe in from per mboe in depreciation  depletion amortization dd a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
our dd a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations 
there are several factors that can impact our composite dd a rate and expense  including but not limited to field production profiles  drilling or acquisition of new wells  disposition of existing wells  and reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and commodity prices  and impairments 
changes to these factors may cause our composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from period to period 
dd a decreased by  or  thousand  in when compared to primarily due to higher prices per mboe that impacted our estimated total reserves  which are the basis for the depletion calculation  and the impact of a impairment of  thousand on the depletable base used to calculate dd a  which was partially offset by higher production 
on a per unit basis  depletion expense decreased by per mboe to per mboe in from per mboe in impairments of oil and gas assets of  thousand in were primarily a result of lower natural gas prices in general and the low volume of gas produced in a few of our central texas fields 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  thousand  in when compared to  primarily due to increases in compensation and benefit expenses associated with hiring additional employees required as a result of the gfb acquisition and assuming operation of approximately additional wells in october the gfb acquisition also increased the volume of the activities and  as a result  the indirect expenses of the activities 
in addition  the company incurred increased legal expenses in due to a number of factors 
the company was required to pay an award of  in attorney s fees as a result of an adverse court decision in a case filed by the company in the company was the subject of two derivative lawsuits filed in also in the company instituted lawsuits against several entities to recover damages relating to its investments in barnett shale operations and to the operation of the properties acquired in the five states acquisition 
during  our operating expenses increased by when compared to due to the following factors lease operating expense  transportation and taxes increased by  or  thousand  in when compared to due to approximately  thousand in additional operating expenses  transportation and taxes attributable to the properties acquired in the gfb acquisition 
the remaining increase is attributable to higher commodity prices that affected the taxes paid during and to the fact that  in  we recorded only months of operating expense  transportation and taxes associated with the properties acquired in five states acquisition  compared to months during depreciation  depletion amortization dd a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method

changes to these factors may cause our composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 
dd a increased by  or  thousand  in when compared to primarily due to approximately  thousand dd a which was related to the oil and gas properties acquired in gfb acquisition 
the remaining increase is attributed to lower commodity prices at year end that impacted our estimated total reserves  which are the basis for the depletion calculation 

table of contents impairments of oil and gas assets of  thousand in were primarily a result of lower commodity prices in general and the low volume of oil and gas produced in a few of our north texas fields and in the wells in which the company participated in the barnett shale formation in parker county  texas  in particular 
impairment of other properties in of thousand was attributed to undeveloped real estate located in israel 
in  we incurred thousand in exploration costs  mainly incurred for a d seismic survey covering certain of the company s leases in wise county 
general and administrative expenses decreased by  or thousand  in when compared to primarily due to the closure of the israeli branch on december  this decrease was partially offset by increases in compensation and benefit expenses associated with additional employees required in connection with the gfb acquisition

for the year ended december   the company recorded a net derivative loss of million million unrealized loss partially offset by a million gain from net cash received on settled contracts 
this change is due to the changes in commodity prices and additional swap contracts we entered in at december   we had a million derivative asset  of which million was classified as current 
we recorded a net derivative gain of million million unrealized gain partially offset by a million loss from net cash payments on settled contracts for the year ended december  compared to a net derivative loss of million million unrealized loss and a million net gain for cash received on settled contracts for the year ended december  this increase in our net derivative gain was primarily attributable to the recent decrease in the forward strip pricing used to value our derivatives and additional swap contracts we entered in income tax income tax benefit for the year ended december  increased by million from the prior year 
the increase in our income tax benefit from the prior year was primarily due to our pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  compared to our pre tax income of million in the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the change in the effective tax rate from the prior year is primarily due to the benefit generated by the changes in estimates of tax benefits associated with amended tax filings
