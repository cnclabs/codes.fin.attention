we have customers throughout the world who rely on us to develop products tailored to their unique needs and requirements that will allow their businesses to succeed 
for their long term success and our own  we committed in to becoming a more efficient  innovative and customer centric company 
we initiated a significant transformation of our business that included  among other things  establishing a new management team  developing a new corporate strategy  reorganizing our internal structure  improving operational efficiencies  divesting non core product lines and reducing the size of our workforce 
prior to and since our acquisition of pinnacle in  our organizational structure was based on three strategic business units professional video  audio and consumer video 
as part of our transformation  we combined our professional video and consumer video business units into one video reporting unit and consolidated our sales and marketing team into a single customer facing organization  which better aligns our business structure with the realities of many of our customers who either depend on  or would benefit from  an integrated solution that encompasses multiple avid product and brand families 
these changes also enable us to leverage our deep domain expertise  brand recognition and technology synergies across customer market segments 
our reporting structure in was based on two strategic business units video and audio  which equated to our reporting units 
we are reporting our financial results in this annual report with reference to these two reportable segments to reflect the way we operated in in the later part of  we completed the reorganization of our business around functional groups rather than product categories 
based on a preliminary assessment of our segment reporting for  we expect to report based on one reportable segment starting january  financial summary the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  net revenues product revenues services revenues total revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill and intangible assets restructuring costs  net gain on sale of assets total operating expenses operating loss interest and other income expense  net loss before income taxes benefit from provision for income taxes net loss total net revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year ended december  compared to  video revenues decreased and audio revenues decreased 
of the million decrease in video revenues  million was attributable to divested or exited product lines  including our softimage d animation and pctv product lines divested in the fourth quarter of we believe the remaining video decrease of million and the audio decrease of million  both primarily due to lower sales volumes  were largely attributable to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions 
the revenues of each business unit are discussed in further detail in the section titled results of operations below 
our gross margin for the year ended december  improved to  compared to for this improvement was largely the result of our transition to a single company wide production and delivery organization and the divestiture of lower margin products discussed above 
revised estimates for royalty accruals resulting in favorable adjustments in were also a significant contributing factor to the gross margin improvement 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  compared to a net loss of million for the net loss for included charges of million for acquisition related intangible asset amortization  million for restructuring costs and million related to acquisition activities 
the net loss for included charges of million for impairment of acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets  million for acquisition related intangible asset amortization and million for restructuring costs  partially offset by gains related to product divestitures totaling million 
the charges of million for impairment of acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets were composed of goodwill impairment losses of million and million for our former consumer video segment and audio segment  respectively  and impairment losses for consumer video intangible assets of million 
see note g to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding our impairment losses 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan that  through the second quarter of  resulted in a reduction in force of more than positions  including employees associated with product line divestitures  and the closure of all or parts of twelve facilities worldwide 
during the third and fourth quarters of  as a result of the expanded use of our internationally based partners for r d projects and our desire to better align our cost structure with revenue expectations  we broadened the restructuring plan to include additional reductions in force of approximately positions and the closure of one floor of our audio segment s daly city  california facility 
in connection with restructuring actions initiated in the fourth quarter of and throughout  we have incurred or expect to incur total restructuring charges of approximately million  which primarily represent cash expenditures 
we expect annual cost savings of approximately million to result from these actions  some of which are already reflected in our results 
cash expenditures resulting from restructuring obligations totaled approximately million during we may engage in additional cost reduction programs  including restructuring actions  in the future as a result of changing economic conditions as well as our ongoing business transformation 
we derive a significant percentage of our revenues from sales to customers outside the united states 
international sales accounted for of our consolidated net revenues in  compared to and of our consolidated net revenues for and  respectively 
our international business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the customers 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates often materially affect  either positively or adversely  our revenues  net income and cash flow 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report for additional risk factors that may cause our future results to differ materially from our current expectations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the following revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges  stock based compensation  the valuation of business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  divestitures  and income tax assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we generally recognize revenues from sales of software and software related products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable and all other revenue recognition criteria of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  subtopic  software revenue recognition formerly statement of position  software revenue recognition  are met 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  we often receive multiple purchase orders or contracts from a single customer or a group of related parties that are evaluated to determine if they are  in effect  parts of a single arrangement 
if they are determined to be parts of a single arrangement  revenues are recorded as if a single multiple element arrangement exists 
in addition  for certain transactions where we consider our services to be non routine or essential to the delivered products  we record revenues upon satisfying the criteria of asc subtopic and obtaining customer acceptance 
within our video segment and much of our audio segment  we follow the guidance of asc subtopic for revenue recognition because our products and services are software or software related 
however  for certain offerings in our audio segment  software is incidental to the delivered products and services 
for these products  we record revenues based on satisfying the criteria in asc subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements formerly emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair values of the undelivered elements  typically professional services  maintenance or both  are deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenues related to the delivered element 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and only recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is typically based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
however  for certain transactions  fair value of maintenance is based on the renewal price that is offered as a contractual right to the customer  provided that the renewal price is substantive 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type  purchase volume  term and customer location 
we review services revenues sold separately and corresponding renewal rates on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  the fair value for services used for revenue recognition purposes to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether fair value exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
in most cases  the products we sell do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires minimal effort and does not have to be performed by us 
however  certain transactions for our video products  typically complex solution sales that include a significant number of products and that may involve multiple customer sites  require us to perform an installation effort that we deem to be complex and non routine 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenues for either the products shipped or the services performed until the installation is complete 
in addition  if these orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenues are recognized until the customer s formal acceptance of the products and services has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
technical support  enhancements and unspecified upgrades typically are provided at no additional charge during an initial warranty period generally between days and twelve months  which precedes commencement of any maintenance contracts 
we defer the fair value of this support and recognize the related revenues ratably over the initial warranty period 
we also from time to time offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for each of these elements that is undelivered at the time of product shipment  and provided that we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered element  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize those revenues only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the upgrade have been satisfied 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
within our video segment  our resellers and distributors are generally not granted rights to return products to us after purchase  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
however  certain video and many of our audio channel partners are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation and price protection 
in accordance with asc subtopic  revenue recognition products formerly statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances as a reduction of revenues in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making these estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions and other known factors 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
the amount and timing of our revenues for any period may be affected if actual product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from our estimates 
a portion of our revenues from sales of consumer video editing and audio products is derived from transactions with channel partners who have unlimited return rights and from whom payment is contingent upon the product being sold through to their customers 
accordingly  revenues for these channel partners are recognized when the products are sold through to the customer instead of being recognized at the time products are shipped to the channel partners 
at the time of a sales transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenues are recognized only if it is probable that collection will occur in a timely manner 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not probable based on our credit review process  revenues are recognized on a cash collected basis to the extent that the other criteria of asc subtopic and sab are satisfied 
at the outset of the arrangement  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenues are recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally days  but can be up to days  after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is successful  revenues are recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
if we were to change any of these assumptions and judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue reported in a particular period 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  an amendment to asc topic  revenue recognition  and accounting standards update no 
 certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  an amendment to asc subtopic  software revenue recognition the updates 
the updates provide guidance on arrangements that include software elements  including tangible products that have software components that are essential to the functionality of the tangible product and will no longer be within the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance  and software enabled products that will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition guidance 
the updates also provide authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance 
under the new guidance  when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  a best estimate of the selling price is required to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the updates also include new disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
the updates must be adopted in the same period using the same transition method and are effective prospectively  with retrospective adoption permitted  for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   or january  for us 
early adoption is also permitted  however  early adoption during an interim period requires retrospective application from the beginning of the fiscal year 
we are currently assessing the timing and method of adoption  as well as the possible impact of this guidance on our revenue recognition policies 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the application of a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
during  we granted stock options as part of our key performer stock based compensation program  as well as stock options and restricted stock units to newly hired employees 
during  we granted both stock options and restricted stock units as part of our key performer stock based compensation program 
the vesting of stock option grants may be based on time  performance  market conditions  or a combination of performance and market conditions 
in the future  we may grant stock awards  options  or other equity based instruments allowed by our stock based compensation plans  or a combination thereof  as part of our overall compensation strategy 
the fair values of restricted stock awards with time based vesting  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are generally based on the intrinsic values of the awards at the date of grant 
as permitted under asc topic  we generally use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on recent six month trailing implied volatility calculations 
these calculations are performed on exchange traded options of our common stock 
we believe that using a forward looking market driven volatility assumption will result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the assumed expected life is based on company specific historical experience 
with regard to the estimate of the expected life  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
in december  we began issuing options to purchase shares of our common stock that had vesting based on market conditions  specifically avid s stock price  or a combination of performance and market conditions 
the compensation costs and derived service periods for stock option grants with vesting based on market conditions or a combination of performance and market conditions are estimated using the monte carlo valuation method 
for stock option grants with vesting based on a combination of performance and market conditions  the compensation costs are also estimated using the black scholes valuation method factored for the estimated probability of achieving the performance goals  and compensation costs for these grants are recorded based on the higher estimate for each vesting tranche 
we estimate forfeiture rates at the time awards are made based on historical and estimated future turnover rates and apply these rates in the calculation of estimated compensation cost 
the estimation of forfeiture rates includes a quarterly review of historical turnover rates and an update of the estimated forfeiture rates to be applied to employee classes for the calculation of stock based compensation 
during  forfeiture rates for the calculation of stock based compensation were estimated and applied based on three classes  non employee directors  executive management staff and other employees 
at december   our annualized estimated forfeiture rates were for non employee director awards and for both executive management staff and other employee awards 
then current estimated forfeiture rates are also applied quarterly to all outstanding stock options and non vested restricted stock awards  which may result in a revised estimate of compensation costs related to these stock based grants 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note b to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding stock based compensation 
business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets  including intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based on estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
the use of different assumptions could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or component thereof will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value and other similar circumstances 
in accordance with asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and others goodwill formerly sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by asc requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units at the date we test for impairment 
our organizational structure in was based on two strategic business units  video and audio  which equated to our reporting units 
both reporting units include goodwill 
in our annual goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we generally use a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine the fair values of our reporting units 
this model focuses on estimates of future revenues and profits for each reporting unit and also assumes a terminal value for the unit based on a constant growth valuation formula 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
the model also includes assumptions for  among others  working capital cash flow  growth rates  income tax rates  expected tax benefits and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
we estimate the long term discount rates based on our review of the weighted average cost of capital and appropriate equity risk premium for each reporting unit 
we also consider the reconciliation of our market capitalization to the total fair value of our reporting units 
if a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment tests as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
at december   the fair values of our video and audio reporting units exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively 
when events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill may not be recoverable  we perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis 
the interim analysis includes calculating the fair value of the reporting unit being tested using a model similar to that used for the annual goodwill impairment testing 
the reporting unit s calculated fair value is then allocated among its tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the fair values of the intangible assets are estimated using various valuation models based on different approaches  such as the multi period excess cash flows approach  royalty savings approach and avoided cost approach 
these approaches include assumptions for  among others  customer retention rates  trademark royalty rates  costs to complete in process technology and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
identifiable intangible assets are also tested for impairment in accordance with asc section  property  plant and equipment overall subsequent measurement  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  if events or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value  and if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
changes in business conditions or our assumptions could require that we record impairment charges related to our identifiable intangible assets 
assumptions  judgments and estimates of future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or forecasts 
although we believe our past assumptions  judgments and estimates used in calculating fair values for goodwill and identifiable intangible asset impairment testing are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
divestitures when we measure the gain loss on sale of a disposal group that is part of a reporting unit  we determine whether a portion of the goodwill of the reporting unit should be allocated to the disposal group if it constitutes a business  under the guidance of asc topic  business combinations 
in determining whether a disposal group constitutes a business  we consider whether the integrated set of activities and assets has the required inputs and processes to create outputs  and whether it s capable of being conducted and managed as a business 
if the disposal group is considered a business  the goodwill of the reporting unit is allocated based on the relative fair values of the disposal group and the portion of the reporting unit remaining 
as discussed in note g to our consolidated financial statements in item  we completed the sales of the softimage d animation and pctv product lines in the fourth quarter of we determined that the softimage d animation product line constituted a business  therefore  the gain on sale of this business includes an allocation of million of goodwill from the former professional video reporting unit 
even though it was determined that the softimage d animation product line constituted a business  we concluded that this business did not represent a component of our company that would require the presentation of the divestiture as a discontinued operation 
we made this determination based on the fact that the softimage d animation product line did not have operations or cash flows that were clearly distinguishable and largely independent from the rest of the professional video reporting unit 
also in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the pctv product line was not a business and  therefore  should not be reported as a discontinued operation based on the fact that the asset group sold would not be able to continue to conduct normal  self sustaining operations 
the application of different judgments or assumptions may have resulted in a material increase or decrease in the amount of gains or losses recorded for the sale of these assets 
in accordance with asc section  property  plant and equipment overall other presentation matters  formerly sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we classify the assets and liabilities of a business as held for sale when management approves and commits to a formal plan of sale and it is probable that the sale will be completed 
the carrying value of the net assets of the business held for sale are then recorded at the lower of their carrying value or fair market value  less costs to sell  and we cease to record depreciation and amortization expense associated with assets held for sale 
income tax assets and liabilities we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes compared to the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability with consideration for such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
asc topic  income taxes formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on our level of deferred tax assets at december  and our level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the need for a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on our us deferred tax assets could change in the future based on our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
reversal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of reversal 
to the extent some or all of our valuation allowance is reversed  future financial statements would reflect an increase in non cash income tax expense until such time as our deferred tax assets are fully utilized 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
we have taken and will continue to take tax positions based on our interpretation of such tax laws 
there can be no assurance that a taxing authority will not have a different interpretation of applicable law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  it could have a negative impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
asc topic requires that a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also requires the accrual of interest and penalties as applicable on our unrecognized tax positions 
at december  and  we had gross unrecognized tax benefits  including interest  of million and million  respectively 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  represented the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would have resulted in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
we conduct operations through manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world 
our transfer pricing methodology is based on economic studies 
the price charged for products  services and financing among our companies could be challenged by the various tax authorities resulting in additional tax liability  interest and or penalties 
results of operations net revenues comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands net revenues of consolidated net revenues net revenues of consolidated net revenues change change in revenues video product revenues services revenues total audio product revenues services revenues total total net revenues excluding a decrease of million related to divested or exited product lines  video product revenues for decreased million 
this decrease was the result of decreases in video product revenues for all products in all geographic regions largely due to lower sales volumes  which we believe was largely the result of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions 
throughout for example  broadcasters were challenged by decreasing advertising revenues  and capital expenditure budgets for many of our customers have been reduced as a result of tight credit markets 
internationally  changes in currency exchange rates also contributed to the decrease in video product revenues 
video services revenues are derived primarily from maintenance contracts  professional and installation services  and training 
excluding a decrease of million related to divested or exited product lines  video services revenues for decreased million 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in maintenance revenues  which was primarily the result of lower average maintenance contract values 
the decrease in maintenance revenues was partially offset by an increase in professional services revenues 
the decrease in audio product revenues for was primarily due to lower revenues on lower volumes of our higher end audio product lines  which we believe largely resulted from decreased capital expenditure budgets for our customers in this market segment 
a proportionally larger decrease in audio product revenues in europe  which we believe were largely attributable to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and changes in currency exchange rates  was also a significant contributing factor to the decrease in audio product revenues 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately and of our consolidated net revenues for and  respectively 
sales to international customers accounted for of our consolidated net revenues in  compared to in international sales decreased by million  or  from to  which is reasonably consistent with our worldwide decrease of 
the decrease in international sales occurred in all geographic regions 
comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands net revenues of consolidated net revenues net revenues of consolidated net revenues change change in revenues video product revenues services revenues total audio product revenues services revenues total total net revenues the decrease in video product revenues in was primarily due to lower revenues from our video editing products and  to a lesser extent  decreased revenues from large broadcast deals and consumer video products 
we believe unfavorable macroeconomic conditions contributed significantly to the overall decrease in video product revenues in in addition  the decrease in video editing revenues was the result of both the slowdown in sales in early in anticipation of our new editor product set  which was released in june  and the price reductions for our video editors announced in the first quarter of the effect of the price reductions was partially offset by higher unit volume sales for these products 
the timing of customer acceptance and revenue recognition was also a contributing factor for the decrease in revenues from large broadcast deals in the decrease in consumer video product revenues in was primarily the result of decreased revenues from our pctv products  largely due to changes in product mix  and lower overall revenues from consumer video products in the fourth quarter of the divestiture of our pctv product line during the fourth quarter of caused a disruption in our consumer video distribution channels that not only affected revenues for our pctv product line but for our consumer video editing products as well 
video services revenues are derived primarily from maintenance contracts  professional and installation services  and training 
the increase in services revenues in was due to increased revenues generated from maintenance contracts sold in connection with our products  as well as increased revenues from professional and installation services 
maintenance revenues increased starting in the second quarter of due to an increase in new large deals that included maintenance contracts 
the decrease in audio product revenues in was primarily the result of decreased revenues from our home studio products  as well as a slowdown in sales of our professional integrated mixing console products 
the decrease in revenues from our home studio products was due to increased competitive pressure and the lingering effects of temporary delays in the release of products compatible with a new version of the mac os x leopard operating system 
products compatible with the new operating system were released late in the second quarter of we believe unfavorable macroeconomic conditions also contributed to the decrease in revenues for our home studio products and were the most significant factor in the slowdown in sales of our professional integrated mixing console products 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately of our consolidated net revenues for both and sales to international customers accounted for of our consolidated net revenues in  compared to in international sales decreased by million  or  from to the decrease in international sales occurred primarily in europe and was partially offset by increased sales in asia 
gross margin cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  testing and distribution of finished products  warehousing  customer support costs related to maintenance contract revenues and other services  and royalties for third party software and hardware included in our products 
cost of revenues also includes amortization of technology  which represents the amortization of developed technology assets acquired as part of the acquisitions that have taken place since and is described further in the amortization of intangible assets section below 
for and  cost of revenues included restructuring charges of million and million  respectively  related to the write down of inventory resulting from our decision to exit the pctv product line 
similarly  for  cost of revenues included a charge of million related to the write down of inventory resulting from our decision to exit the transmission server product line 
gross margin fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware and software included in the systems sold  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  sales of aftermarket hardware products such as disk drives  and currency exchange rate fluctuations 
comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands costs gross margin costs gross margin change in gross margin cost of products revenues cost of services revenues amortization of intangible assets restructuring costs total our transition to a single company wide production and delivery organization and the divestiture of lower margin product lines were the most significant contributing factors to our improved product gross margins for in addition  revised estimates for royalty accruals resulting in favorable adjustments in were also a contributing factor 
these improvements were partially offset by the impact on revenues of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the increase in services gross margin for primarily resulted from improved efficiencies in our customer success and professional services organizations related to our business transformation 
the improved efficiencies were the result of the reorganization and consolidation of services activities and the related reductions in headcount 
comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands costs gross margin costs gross margin change in gross margin cost of products revenues cost of services revenues amortization of intangible assets restructuring costs total significant contributing factors for our decreased product gross margin percentages for were increased royalty expenses  accrued duties related to an unfavorable tariff ruling in europe and inventory write downs largely related to discontinued or divested products 
the decrease in product gross margin attributable to these items was  of which approximately one half was related to our divested consumer video products

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets result from acquisitions and include developed technology  customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
with the exception of developed technology  these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
developed technology is amortized over the greater of the amount calculated using the ratio of current quarter revenues to the total of current quarter and anticipated future revenues over the estimated useful life of the developed technology  and the straight line method over each developed technology s remaining useful life 
amortization of developed technology is recorded within cost of revenues 
amortization of customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets is recorded within operating expenses

our annual goodwill analysis performed in the fourth quarter of determined that the fair values of our video and audio reporting units exceeded their carrying values by and  respectively  indicating there was no goodwill impairment for either reporting unit at december  the goodwill assigned to our video and audio reporting units totaled million and million  respectively  at december  goodwill is also tested for impairment when events and circumstances occur that indicate that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
at march  as a result of a decline in our stock price since our fourth quarter goodwill impairment testing  lower than expected first quarter revenues  and a reduction in our forecasted results  we performed an interim step one goodwill impairment test 
the step one test indicated that no goodwill impairment existed at march in the fourth quarter of due to the significant decline in our stock price  increased uncertainty of future revenue levels due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions and the divestiture of our pctv product line  our annual goodwill testing determined that the carrying values of the audio and former consumer video reporting units exceeded their fair values  indicating possible goodwill impairments for these reporting units 
the fair values of these reporting units were then allocated among their respective tangible and intangible assets and liabilities to determine the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill 
because the book values of the audio and consumer video goodwill exceeded their implied fair values by approximately million and million  respectively  we recorded these amounts as impairment losses during the quarter ended december  in september  as a result of a decrease in market value for  and the expected sale of  our pctv product line  which had historically accounted for a significant portion of former consumer video reporting unit revenues  we performed an interim impairment test on the goodwill assigned to our consumer video reporting unit 
because the book value of the consumer video goodwill exceeded the implied fair value by million  we recorded this amount as an impairment loss during the quarter ended september  in connection with the goodwill impairment loss taken for the audio and former consumer video reporting units in the fourth quarter of  we also reviewed the audio and consumer video identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
now asc subtopic 
this analysis included grouping the intangible assets with other operating assets and liabilities in the consumer video reporting unit that would not otherwise be subject to impairment testing because the grouped assets and liabilities represent the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities within our company 
the result of this analysis determined that the consumer video customer relationships and trade name intangible assets were impaired  and we recorded impairment losses of million and million  respectively  to write these assets down to their then current fair values 
the analysis for the audio reporting unit determined that no impairment existed for that reporting unit s identifiable intangible assets 
in connection with the goodwill impairment loss taken for the former consumer video reporting unit in the third quarter of  we also tested the consumer video reporting unit s identifiable intangible assets for impairment 
as a result  we determined that the trade name intangible asset was impaired  and we recorded an impairment loss of million to write this asset down to its then current fair value

restructuring costs  net in october  we initiated a company wide restructuring plan that included a reduction in force of approximately positions  including employees related to our product line divestitures  and the closure of all or parts of some of our worldwide facilities 
the restructuring plan is intended to improve operational efficiencies and bring our costs in line with expected revenues 
in connection with the plan  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to employee termination costs and million for the closure of three small facilities 
in addition  as a result of the decision to sell the pctv product line  we recorded a non cash restructuring charge of million in cost of revenues related to the write down of inventory 
during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  of which million related to this plan and a recovery of million was the result of revised estimates for amounts recorded under previous restructuring plans 
charges under the plan included new restructuring charges of million and revisions to previously recorded estimates under the plan of million 
the new restructuring charges included million related to employee termination costs  including those for approximately additional employees  million related to the closure of all or part of eleven facilities  and million  recorded in cost of revenues  related to the write down of pctv inventory 
the charges resulting from the reduction in force of additional employees were recorded in the third and fourth quarters and were primarily the result of the expanded use of our internationally based partners for r d projects and our desire to better align our cost structure with revenue expectations 
during the first nine months of  we initiated restructuring plans within our former professional video business unit as well as corporate operations to eliminate duplicative business functions and improve operational efficiencies 
in connection with these actions  we recorded restructuring charges of million related to employee termination costs for approximately employees  primarily in the research and development  marketing and selling  and general and administrative teams 
also during  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million for revised estimates of previously initiated restructuring plans 
during  we implemented restructuring programs within our former professional video and consumer video business units  as well as corporate operations  resulting in restructuring charges of million  million and million  respectively 
in connection with these actions  we recorded charges totaling million related to employee termination costs for approximately employees  primarily from the research and development teams and marketing and selling teams 
actions under these restructuring programs also included the closure of all or parts of five facilities  resulting in restructuring charges totaling million  and our exit from the transmission server product line 
as a result of exiting the transmission server product line  we recorded non cash charges totaling million in cost of revenues for the write down of inventory 
we also recorded a non cash restructuring charge of million related to the disposal of fixed assets 
the purpose of these restructuring programs was to eliminate duplicative business functions  improve operational efficiencies and align key business skill sets with future opportunities 
also during  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million as a result of our increased estimates for the facilities restructuring costs related to our pinnacle and medea acquisitions  and million primarily as a result of our increased estimate for the restructuring costs associated with the vacated portion of our montreal facility that was part of a restructuring that took place in december gain on sales of assets in the fourth quarter of  we sold our softimage d animation product line  which was part of our former professional video segment  and our pctv product line  which was part of our former consumer video segment 
the softimage d animation product line was sold to autodesk  inc  and million of the million dollar purchase price was received in the fourth quarter of  with the remaining balance held in escrow with scheduled distribution dates in and during  we recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction  which does not include the proceeds held in escrow 
during  we recorded a further gain of million as a result of the release of of the funds from the escrow holdings  in accordance with the terms of the purchase and sale agreement 
the remaining escrow holdings of million  subject to possible adjustment  are scheduled to be released during the fourth quarter of the pctv product line was sold to hauppauge digital  inc for total proceeds of approximately million  which included million in cash and a note valued at million 
during  we recognized a gain of approximately million as a result of this transaction 
pctv inventory valued at million was classified as held for sale in accordance with asc section  property  plant and equipment overall other presentation matters formerly sfas no 
 and included in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet at december  under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we are reimbursed for the cost of pctv inventory sold by the buyer 
during  the buyer s sell through of inventory classified as held for sale was lower than anticipated  and  as a result  we recorded a loss on the sale of assets of million related to our sale of the pctv product line 
at december   the remaining value of inventory classified as held for sale was million

comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands change change interest and other income expense  net as a percentage of net revenues the change in interest and other income expense  net  from net income in to net expense in  was primarily the result of a significant decrease in interest income due to lower interest rates paid on cash balances  as well as lower average cash balances 
comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands change change interest and other income expense  net as a percentage of net revenues the decrease in interest and other income  net  for was primarily due to decreased interest income earned due to decreased rates of return on cash and marketable securities balances  as well as decreased average cash and marketable securities balances resulting from our stock repurchases in early benefit from provision for income taxes  net comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands change benefit from provision for income taxes  net as a percentage of net revenues comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands change benefit from provision for income taxes  net as a percentage of net revenues the net tax benefit of million for reflected a current tax benefit of million and a deferred tax benefit of million mostly related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets and the release of a valuation allowance on a portion of the deferred tax assets in our canadian entity

the net tax provision of million for reflected a current tax provision of million and a deferred tax benefit of million mostly related to the foreign amortization of non deductible acquisition related intangible assets and to a release of a deferred tax liability in our german entity 
our effective tax rate  which represents our tax benefit provision as a percentage of profit or loss before tax  was  and  respectively  for  and our benefit from provision for income taxes and effective tax rate both changed from net provisions in to net benefits in the changes were the result of discrete tax benefits of million primarily related to the completion of a foreign tax audit  million for cumulative adjustments of prior year provisions to actual tax return filings and million from the utilization of unused r d tax credits  all occurring in the slight decrease in our provision for income taxes in  compared to  resulted primarily from a discrete tax benefit of million resulting from the write down of deferred tax liabilities due to goodwill and intangible asset impairments and an expected million benefit from a provision of the housing and economic recovery act of  which allows for the utilization of unused r d tax credits 
we generally recognize no significant us tax benefit from acquisition related amortization 
our federal tax benefit was primarily related to the discrete tax items mentioned above 
our state tax provision was the result of minimal state tax payments 
the tax rate in each year is affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been  and  respectively  for the years  and these rates differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the mix of income and losses in foreign jurisdictions  which have tax rates that differ from the statutory rate  non deductible impairment of goodwill expenses  and non deductible acquisition related expenses 
we file in multiple tax jurisdictions and from time to time are subject to audit in certain tax jurisdictions  but we believe that we are adequately reserved for these exposures 
see note h to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information on our unrecognized tax benefits at december  and liquidity and capital resources current cash flows and commitments we have funded our operations in recent years through cash flows from operations as well as from the proceeds of the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
net cash of million was used in our operating activities in  compared to million and million provided by our operating activities in and  respectively 
in  net cash used in operating activities primarily reflected our net loss adjusted for depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation expense  as well as changes in working capital items  in particular decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  offset by decreases in deferred revenues and accrued expenses including restructuring accruals 
in  net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected our net loss adjusted for depreciation and amortization  goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses  stock based compensation expense  and the gain on the sale of our softimage d animation and pctv product lines  as well as changes in working capital items  in particular decreases in accounts receivable and inventories and an increase in accrued expenses 
in  cash provided by operating activities primarily reflected non cash adjustments to our net loss for depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense  as well as a decrease in inventories and an increase in deferred revenues 
accounts receivable decreased by million to million at december   from million at december   driven by the decrease in net revenues of in the fourth quarter of  when compared to the same period of  as well as improved collections reflected by a decrease in days sales outstanding 
these balances are net of allowances for sales returns  bad debts and customer rebates  all of which we estimate and record based primarily on historical experience 
days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days at december   compared to days at december  at december  and  we held inventory in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
these balances include stockroom  spare parts and demonstration equipment inventories at various locations and inventory at customer sites related to shipments for which we have not yet recognized revenues 
the decrease in inventory of million from december  to december  was primarily due to improved efficiencies resulting from the consolidation of operations in connection with our business transformation 
we review all inventory balances regularly for excess quantities or potential obsolescence and make appropriate adjustments as needed to write down the inventories to reflect their estimated realizable value 
we source inventory products and components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
deferred revenues decreased by million to million at december   from million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of the recognition of deferred revenue related to large broadcast deals accepted in the fourth quarter of and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in deferrals related to maintenance contracts resulting from lower average maintenance contract values and the timing of contract renewals 
restructuring accruals decreased by million to million at december   from million at december  this decrease was primarily the result of restructuring related cash payments of million and non cash write offs of million  offset by restructuring charges of million 
in connection with restructuring activities during and prior periods  at december   we had restructuring accruals of million and million related to severance and lease obligations  respectively 
our future cash obligations for leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities total approximately million 
the lease accruals represent the present value of the excess of our lease commitments on the vacated space over expected payments to be received on subleases of the relevant facilities 
the lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate earlier terminations 
the severance payments will be made during the next twelve months 
all payments related to restructuring actions are expected to be funded through working capital 
see note n to our consolidated financial statements in item for the activity in the restructuring and other costs accrual for net cash flow used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively  compared to million provided by investing activities in we hold our excess cash in short term marketable securities and convert them to cash as needed 
the net cash flow used in investing activities for primarily reflected purchases of property and equipment and a million facility related escrow deposit into a long term asset account  partially offset by net proceeds of million resulting from the timing of the sale and purchase of marketable securities and the release of escrow holdings totaling million related to the sale of our softimage d animation product line 
the remaining escrow holdings of million  subject to possible adjustment  are scheduled to be released during the fourth quarter of the million facility related escrow deposit was related to our recently signed leases for facilities in burlington  massachusetts

the net cash flow provided by investing activities for primarily reflected net proceeds of million resulting from the timing of the sale and purchase of marketable securities  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
we purchased million of property and equipment during  compared to million during and million in purchases of property and equipment in all years consisted primarily of computer hardware and software to support r d activities and our information systems 
our cash requirements for capital spending in are expected to total approximately million 
this amount could increase in the event we enter into strategic business acquisitions or for other reasons 
on january   we acquired all the outstanding shares of blue order solutions ag for approximately million 
net cash flow provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million and million used in financing activities in and  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities in reflected proceeds of million from the issuance of stock related to the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million used to repurchase stock options during the second quarter of the cash used in financing activities in was the result of million used for our stock repurchase program  slightly offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
the cash used in financing activities in reflected a million repurchase of our common stock  partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of stock related to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
a stock repurchase program was approved by our board of directors in april  which authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through transactions on the open market  in block trades or otherwise 
in february  our board of directors approved a million increase in authorized funds for the repurchase of our common stock under this program 
during  we repurchased  shares of our common stock under the program for a total purchase price  including commissions  of million 
during  we repurchased an additional  shares of our common stock for a total purchase price  including commissions  of million  leaving million authorized for future repurchases 
no shares of our common stock were repurchased under this program in the stock repurchase program is being funded through working capital and has no expiration date 
our cash requirements vary depending on factors such as our growth  capital expenditures  acquisitions of businesses or technologies and obligations under restructuring programs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so or that we could do so on favorable terms 
fair value measurements we value our cash and investment instruments using quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency 
see note b to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for disclosure of the fair values and the inputs used to determine the fair values of our financial assets and financial liabilities 
contractual and commercial obligations the following table sets forth future payments that we were obligated to make at december  under existing lease agreements and commitments to purchase inventory in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other contractual arrangements or unrecognized tax positions that may result in cash payments consisted of the following at december  in thousands total a less than year years years after years transactions with recourse unrecognized tax positions and related interest stand by letters of credit a at december   liability related to unrecognized tax positions and related interest was million  and we were unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the liability in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of the positions 
through third parties  we offer lease financing options to our customers 
during the terms of these financing arrangements  which are generally for three years  we may remain liable for a portion of the unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user  but our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances 
at december   our maximum exposure under these programs was million 
we have three letters of credit at a bank that are used as security deposits in connection with our recently leased burlington  massachusetts office space 
in the event of default on the underlying leases  the landlords would  at december   be eligible to draw against the letters of credit to a maximum of approximately million in the aggregate 
the letters of credit are subject to aggregate reductions of approximately million at the end of each of the second  third and fifth years  provided the company is not in default of the underlying leases and meets certain financial performance conditions 
in no case will the letters of credit amounts be reduced to below million in the aggregate throughout the lease periods  all of which extend to may at december   the company was not in default of any of the underlying leases 
we also have a stand by letter of credit at a bank that is used as a security deposit in connection with our daly city  california office space lease 
in the event of a default on this lease  the landlord would be eligible to draw against this letter of credit to a maximum  at december   of thousand 
the letter of credit will remain in effect at this amount throughout the remaining lease period  which runs through september at december   we were not in default of this lease 
we operate our business globally and  consequently  our results from operations are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into forward exchange contracts  which generally have one month maturities  to reduce exposures associated with the foreign exchange risks of certain forecasted third party and intercompany receivables  payables and cash balances 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound  japanese yen and canadian dollar  as a hedge against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities 
at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

this guidance requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as one with the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest 
the guidance is effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period commencing after november   or january  for us  with early adoption prohibited

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have significant international operations and  therefore  our revenues  earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  sales transactions and net investments in foreign operations 
we derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances  we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts 
there are two objectives of our foreign currency forward contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
these forward contracts typically mature within days of execution 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies and contract rates versus financial statement rates 
to the extent these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound  japanese yen and canadian dollar  as a hedge against actual and forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
the mark to market effect associated with foreign currency forward contracts was a net unrealized gain of million at december  for the year ended december   net gains of million resulting from forward contracts and million of net transaction and remeasurement gains on the related assets and liabilities were included in our results of operations 
as it relates to our use of foreign currency forward contracts  a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term certificates of deposit  commercial paper  asset backed securities  discount notes  and corporate  municipal  agency and foreign bonds 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturities
