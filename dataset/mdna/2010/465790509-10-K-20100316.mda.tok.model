item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report 
our ability to monetize non core assets and replace revenues generated from any sale of our existing properties depends upon market conditions and numerous uncertainties we continue to explore opportunities to generate capital for the ongoing development of our core htl business  which may involve efforts to monetize non core assets used in other areas of our business  including our exploration  development and production assets in china 
there can be no assurance that we will sell or otherwise monetize any such assets nor that any such sale or monetization initiative  if and when made  will generate sufficient capital for the ongoing development of our core htl business 
our operating revenues and cash flows would likely decrease significantly following the sale of any material portion of our existing producing assets and would likely remain at lower levels until we were able to replace the lost production with production from new properties 
our heavy oil project in canada may be exposed to title risks and aboriginal claims we have not obtained title opinions in respect of the athabasca heavy oil leases we acquired from talisman energy and there is a risk that our ownership of those leases may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or interests or undetected claims or interests that could impair our title 
any such impairment could jeopardize our entitlement to the economic benefits  if any  associated with the leases  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to execute our business plans in a timely manner or at all 
aboriginal peoples have claimed aboriginal title and rights to large areas of land in western canada where crude oil and natural gas operations are conducted  including a claim filed against the government of canada  the province of alberta  certain governmental entities and the regional municipality of wood buffalo which includes the city of fort mcmurray  alberta claiming  among other things  aboriginal title to large areas of lands surrounding fort mcmurray where most of the oil sands operations in alberta are located 
such claims  if successful  could affect the title to our heavy oil leases and have a significant adverse effect on our business 

table of contents our investment in ecuador may be at risk if the agreement through which we hold our interest in the block project is challenged or cannot be enforced we hold our interest in the block heavy oil project in ecuador through a services agreement with petroecuador and its subsidiary petroproduccion 
the agreement is governed by the laws of ecuador 
although the agreement has been translated into english  the official and governing language of the agreement is spanish and if any discrepancy exists between the official spanish version of the agreement and the english translation  the official spanish version prevails 
there may be ambiguities  inconsistencies and anomalies between the official spanish version of the agreement and the english translation that could materially affect how our rights and obligations under the agreement are conclusively interpreted and such interpretations may be materially adverse to our interests 
the dispute resolution provisions of the block agreement stipulate that disputes involving industrial property including intellectual property and technical or economic issues are subject to international arbitration 
other disputes are subject to resolution through mediation or arbitration in ecuador 
there is a risk that we and the other parties to the block agreement will be unable to agree upon the proper forum for the resolution of a dispute based on the subject matter of the dispute 
there can also be no assurance that the other parties to the block agreement comply with the dispute resolution provisions of the block agreement or otherwise voluntarily submit to arbitration 
government policy in ecuador may change to discourage foreign investment or requirements not currently foreseen may be implemented 
there can be no assurance that our investments and assets in ecuador will not be subject to nationalization  requisition or confiscation  whether legitimate or not  by any authority or body 
while the block agreement contains provisions for compensation and reimbursement of losses we may suffer under such circumstances  there is no assurance that such provisions would effectively restore the value of our original investment 
there can be no assurance that ecuadorian laws protecting foreign investments will not be amended or abolished or that the existing laws will be enforced or interpreted to provide adequate protection against any or all of the risks described above 
there can also be no assurance that the block agreement will prove to be enforceable or provide adequate protection against any or all of the risks described above 
estimates of proved reserves and future net revenue may change if the assumptions on which such estimates are based prove to be inaccurate our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment and the assumptions used regarding prices for oil and natural gas  production volumes  required levels of operating and capital expenditures  and quantities of recoverable oil reserves 
oil prices have fluctuated widely in recent years 
volatility is expected to continue and price fluctuations directly affect estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues 
actual prices  production  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil reserves will vary from those assumed in our estimates  and these variances may be significant 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from the estimates we report 
in addition  actual results of drilling  testing and production and changes in natural gas and oil prices after the date of the estimate may result in revisions to our reserve estimates 
revisions to prior estimates may be material 
no reserves have yet been established in respect of our htl projects in canada and ecuador no reserves have yet been established in respect of our athabasca heavy oil project in canada or our block project in ecuador 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves  including many factors beyond our control and no assurance can be given that any level of reserves or recovery thereof will be realized 
in general  estimates of reserves are based upon a number of assumptions made as of the date on which the estimates were determined  many of which are subject to change and are beyond our control 
information in this document regarding our future plans reflects our current intent and is subject to change we describe our current exploration and development plans in this annual report 
whether we ultimately implement our plans will depend on availability and cost of capital  receipt of htl technology process test results  additional seismic data or reprocessed existing data  current and projected oil or gas prices  costs and availability of drilling rigs and other equipment  supplies and personnel  success or failure of activities in similar areas  changes in estimates of project completion costs  our ability to attract other industry partners to acquire a portion of the working interest to reduce costs and exposure to risks and decisions of our joint working interest owners 

table of contents we will continue to gather data about our projects and it is possible that additional information will cause us to alter our schedule or determine that a project should not be pursued at all 
you should understand that our plans regarding our projects might change 
our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain our interests in licenses  leases and production sharing contracts some of our properties are held under licenses and leases  working interests in licenses and leases or production sharing contracts 
if we fail to meet the specific requirements of the instrument through which we hold our interest  it may terminate or expire 
we may not be able to meet any or all of the obligations required to maintain our interest in each such license  lease or production sharing contract 
some of our property interests will terminate unless we fulfill such obligations 
if we are unable to satisfy these obligations on a timely basis  we may lose our rights in these properties 
the termination of our interests in these properties may harm our business 
we may incur significant costs on exploration or development efforts which may prove unsuccessful or unprofitable there can be no assurance that the costs we incur on exploration or development will result in an economic return 
we may misinterpret geologic or engineering data  which may result in significant losses on unsuccessful exploration or development drilling efforts 
we bear the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to unexpected geologic conditions  equipment failures  equipment delivery delays  accidents  adverse weather  government and joint venture partner approval delays  construction or start up delays and other associated risks 
such risks may delay expected production and or increase costs of production or otherwise adversely affect our ability to realize an acceptable level of economic return on a particular project in a timely manner or at all 
our business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may not protect us against all these risks there are hazards and risks inherent in drilling for  producing and transporting oil and gas 
these hazards and risks may result in loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims  and other damage to our properties and third parties and include fires  natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  explosions  encountering formations with abnormal pressures  encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations  blowouts  cratering  unexpected operational events  equipment malfunctions  pipeline ruptures  spills  compliance with environmental and government regulations and title problems 
we are insured against some  but not all  of the hazards associated with our business  so we may sustain losses that could be substantial due to events that are not insured or are underinsured 
the occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not carry business interruption insurance and  therefore  the loss and delay of revenues resulting from curtailed production are not insured 
changes to laws  regulations and government policies in canada or ecuador could adversely affect our ability to develop our htl projects our htl projects in canada and ecuador are subject to substantial regulation relating to the exploration for  and the development  production  upgrading  marketing  pricing  taxation  and transportation of bitumen and heavy oil and related products and other matters  including environmental protection 
legislation and regulations may be changed from time to time in response to economic or political conditions 
the exercise of discretion by governmental authorities under existing legislation and regulations  the implementation of new legislation or regulations or the amending of existing legislation and regulations affecting the crude oil and natural gas industry generally could materially increase the costs of developing these projects and could have a material adverse impact on our business 
there can be no assurance that laws  regulations and government policies relevant to these projects will not be changed in a manner which may adversely affect our ability to develop and operate them 
failure to obtain all necessary permits  leases  licenses and approvals  or failure to obtain them on a timely basis  could result in delays or restructuring of the projects and increased costs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
construction  operation and decommissioning of these projects will be conditional upon the receipt of necessary permits  leases  licenses and other approvals from applicable governmental and regulatory authorities 
the approval process can involve stakeholder consultation  environmental impact assessments  public hearings and appeals to tribunals and courts  among other things 
an inability to secure local and regional community support could result in the necessary approvals being delayed or stopped 
there is no assurance such approvals will be issued  or if granted  will not be appealed or cancelled or will be renewed upon expiry or will not contain terms and conditions that adversely affect the final design or economics of the projects 

table of contents complying with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our production our operations are governed by numerous laws and regulations at various levels of government in the countries in which we operate 
oil sands and heavy oil extraction  upgrading and transportation operations are subject to extensive regulation and various approvals are required before such activities may be undertaken 
we are subject to laws and regulations that govern the operation and maintenance of our facilities  the discharge of materials into the environment and other environmental protection issues 
these laws and regulations may  among other potential consequences  require that we acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict the substances that can be released into the environment with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  require that reclamation measures be taken to prevent pollution from former operations  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells and remediating contaminated soil and groundwater and require remedial measures be taken with respect to property designated as a contaminated site 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injury  clean up costs and other environmental and property damages  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages as well as environmental damage that occurs over time 
however  we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability of environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost 
accordingly  we could be liable  or could be required to cease production on properties  if environmental damage occurs 
the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future may harm our business 
furthermore  future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur that result in stricter standards and enforcement  larger fines and liability  and increased capital expenditures and operating costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
no assurance can be given with respect to the impact of future environmental laws or the approvals  processes or other requirements thereunder on our ability to develop or operate our projects in a manner consistent with our current expectations 
during and  the federal government of canada proposed a regulatory framework and plan for the reduction of canada s total greenhouse gas emissions from levels by by and by to by other approaches to reducing greenhouse gases  including a north america wide cap and trade system have also been proposed 
the potential extent and magnitude of any adverse impacts of these proposals cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific legislative and regulatory requirements have not been implemented and uncertainty exists with respect to which  if any  of the proposals being considered will ultimately be implemented 
in the province of alberta  where our tamarack project is located  the climate change and emissions management act has a targeted specified gas emission target relative to alberta s gross domestic product to an amount that is equal to or less than of levels 
the future federal industrial air pollutant and greenhouse gas emission reduction targets  together with provincial emission reduction requirements in alberta s climate change and emissions management act  or emission reduction requirements in future regulatory approvals  may not be technically or economically feasible to implement and the failure to meet such emission intensity reduction requirements or other compliance mechanisms may materially adversely affect our ability to develop and operate the tamarack project and result in fines  penalties and the suspension of operations 
as well  equipment from suppliers which can meet future emission standards may not be available on an economic basis and other compliance methods of reducing emission intensity to required levels in the future may significantly increase our capital and operating costs or reduce output of the project 
we may not be able for technical or economic reasons to take advantage of incentives to implement certain capture and storage 
emission reduction or off set credits may not be available for acquisition by the tamarack project or may not be available on an economic basis 
there is also the risk that governments could impose additional emission or emission intensity reduction requirements or pass legislation which would tax such emissions 
no assurance can be given that environmental laws will not result in a curtailment of project development or a material increase in the costs of production  development or exploration activities or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
we compete for oil and gas properties with many other exploration and development companies throughout the world who have access to greater resources we operate in a highly competitive environment in which we compete with other exploration and development companies to acquire a limited number of prospective oil and gas properties 
many of our competitors are much larger than we are and  as a result  may enjoy a competitive advantage in accessing financial  technical and human resources 
they may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial  technical and human resources permit 

table of contents our principal shareholder may significantly influence our business as at the date of this annual report  our largest shareholder  robert m 
friedland  owned approximately of our common shares 
as a result  he has the voting power to significantly influence our policies  business and affairs and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all  or substantially all  of our assets 
in addition  the concentration of our ownership may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control that otherwise could result in a premium in the price of our common shares 
if we lose our key management and technical personnel  our business may suffer we rely upon a relatively small group of key management personnel 
given the technological nature of our business  we also rely heavily upon our scientific and technical personnel 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
we do not maintain any key man insurance 
we do not have employment agreements with certain of our key management and technical personnel and we cannot assure you that these individuals will remain with us in the future 
an unexpected partial or total loss of their services would harm our business 
development of our heavy oil projects in canada and ecuador will require the recruitment and retention of experienced employees 
we compete with other companies to recruit and retain the limited number of individuals who possess the requisite skills and experience in the particular areas of expertise that are relevant to our business 
this competition exposes us to the risk that we will have to pay increased compensation to such employees or increase the company s reliance and associated costs from partnering or outsourcing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that all of the employees with the necessary abilities and expertise we require will be available

unresolved staff comments we have no unresolved staff comments from the sec staff regarding our periodic or current reports filed under the act 
item legal proceedings the company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed november  in the united states district court of colorado by jack j 
grynberg and three affiliated companies that alleges bribery and other misconduct and challenges the propriety of a contract awarded to the company s wholly owned subsidiary ivanhoe energy ecuador inc to develop ecuador s pungarayacu heavy oil field 
plaintiffs claims are for unspecified damages or ownership of ivanhoe energy ecuador inc s interest in the pungarayacu field 
all defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of personal jurisdiction 
the court granted the motions  noted its view that plaintiffs claims are not likely to have merit  and dismissed the case without prejudice 
the court granted the request of defendant robert m 
friedland to sanction the plaintiffs and the plaintiffs counsel for their conduct related to bringing the suit by awarding mr 
friedland fees and costs 
the defendants comprising the company and its subsidiaries were awarded their costs in defending the suit 
all defendants are now in the process of seeking an award of their attorney fees and costs 
on october   the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the court vacate its judgment and allow discovery on jurisdictional issues on the grounds that plaintiffs had discovered new evidence 
the defendants have filed their opposition and the plaintiffs have filed their reply  and the motion is now ready for decision by the court 
the court has not yet announced a hearing date or indicated when the motion will be resolved 
the likelihood of loss or gain resulting from the lawsuit  and the estimated amount of ultimate loss or gain  are not determinable or reasonably estimable at this time

exemptions from certain nasdaq marketplace rules as a canadian issuer listed on the nasdaq stock market nasdaq  we are not required to comply with certain of nasdaq s marketplace rules and instead may comply with applicable canadian requirements 
as a foreign private issuer  we are only required to comply with the following nasdaq rules i we must have an audit committee that satisfies applicable nasdaq requirements and that is composed of directors each of whom satisfy nasdaq s prescribed independence standards  ii we must provide nasdaq with prompt notification after an executive officer of the company becomes aware of any material non compliance by us with any applicable nasdaq marketplace rule  iii our common shares must be eligible for a direct registration program operated by a clearing agency registered under section a of the securities exchange act of  and iv we must provide a brief description of any significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those followed by us companies quoted on nasdaq 
applicable canadian rules pertaining to corporate governance require us to disclose in our management proxy circular  on an annual basis  our corporate governance practices  including whether or not our independent directors hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present  but there is no legal requirement in canada for independent directors to hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present 
although our non management directors hold meetings from time to time as and when considered necessary or desirable by the independent lead director  such meetings are not regularly scheduled 
enforceability of civil liabilities we are a company incorporated under the laws of the yukon territory of canada 
some of our directors  controlling shareholders  officers and representatives of the experts named in this annual report on form k reside outside the us and a substantial portion of their assets and our assets are located outside the us as a result  it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the us upon the directors  controlling shareholders  officers and representatives of experts who are not residents of the us or to enforce against them judgments obtained in the courts of the us based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws or other laws of the us there is doubt as to the enforceability in canada against us or against any of our directors  controlling shareholders  officers or experts who are not residents of the us  in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts  of liabilities based solely upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
therefore  it may not be possible to enforce those actions against us  our directors  officers  controlling shareholders or experts named in this annual report on form k 

table of contents holders of common shares as at december   a total of  of our common shares were issued and outstanding and held by holders of record with an estimated  additional shareholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts 
dividends we have not paid any dividends on our outstanding common shares since we were incorporated and we do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future 
the declaration of dividends on our common shares is  subject to certain statutory restrictions described below  within the discretion of our board of directors based on their assessment of  among other factors  our earnings or lack thereof  our capital and operating expenditure requirements and our overall financial condition 
under the yukon business corporations act  our board of directors has no discretion to declare or pay a dividend on our common shares if they have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or after payment of the dividend would be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of our assets would  as a result of the dividend  be less than the aggregate sum of our liabilities and the stated capital of our common shares 
exchange controls and taxation there is no law or governmental decree or regulation in canada that restricts the export or import of capital  or affects the remittance of dividends  interest or other payments to a non resident holder of our common shares  other than withholding tax requirements 
there is no limitation imposed by the laws of canada  the laws of the yukon territory  or our constating documents on the right of a non resident to hold or vote our common shares  other than as provided in the investment canada act canada the investment act  which generally prohibits a reviewable investment by an investor that is not a canadian  as defined  unless after review  the minister responsible for the investment act is satisfied that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to canada 
an investment in our common shares by a non canadian who is not a wto investor which includes governments of  or individuals who are nationals of  member states of the world trade organization and corporations and other entities which are controlled by them  at a time when we were not already controlled by a wto investor  would be reviewable under the investment act under two circumstances 
first  if it was an investment to acquire control within the meaning of the investment act a cultural business and the value of our assets  as determined under investment act regulations  was cdn 
million or more 
second  the investment would also be reviewable if an order for review was made by the federal cabinet of the canadian government on the grounds that the investment related to canada s cultural heritage or national identity as prescribed under the investment act  regardless of asset value 
currently  an investment in our common shares by a wto investor  or by a non canadian at a time when we were already controlled by a wto investor  would be reviewable under the investment act if it was an investment to acquire control and the value of our assets  as determined under investment act regulations  was not less than a specified amount  which for is cdn 
million 
the investment act provides detailed rules to determine if there has been an acquisition of control 
for example  a non canadian would acquire control of us for the purposes of the investment act if the non canadian acquired a majority of our outstanding common shares 
the acquisition of less than a majority  but one third or more  of our common shares would be presumed to be an acquisition of control of us unless it could be established that  on the acquisition  we were not controlled in fact by the acquirer through the ownership of common shares 
an acquisition of control for the purposes of the investment act could also occur as a result of the acquisition by a non canadian of all or substantially all of our assets 
the canadian federal government has recently brought forth certain amendments the amendments to the investment act 
once they come into force  the amendments would generally raise the thresholds that trigger governmental review 
specifically  with respect to wto investors  the amendments would see the thresholds for the review of direct acquisitions of control of a business which is not a cultural business increase from the current cdn 
million based on book value to cdn 
million to be based on the enterprise value of the canadian business for the two years after the amendments come into force  to cdn 
million in the following two years and then to cdn 
billion for the next two years 
thereafter  the threshold is to be adjusted to account for inflation 
the amendments will come into force when the government enacts regulations which  among other things  will provide how the enterprise value is to be determined 
the investment act also provides that the minister of industry may initiate a review of any acquisition by a non canadian of our shares or assets if the minister considers that the acquisition could be injurious to canada s national security 

table of contents amounts that we may  in the future  pay or credit  or be deemed to have paid or credited  to you as dividends in respect of the common shares you hold at a time when you are not a resident of canada within the meaning of the income tax act canada will generally be subject to canadian non resident withholding tax of of the amount paid or credited  which may be reduced under the canada us income tax convention  as amended  the convention 
currently  under the convention  the rate of canadian non resident withholding tax on the gross amount of dividends paid or credited to a us resident that is entitled to the benefits of the convention is generally 
however  if the beneficial owner of such dividends is a us resident corporation that is entitled to the benefits of the convention and owns or more of our voting stock  the withholding rate is reduced to

ivanhoe energy s business ivanhoe energy is an independent international heavy oil development and production company focused on pursuing long term growth in its reserve base and production 
ivanhoe energy plans to utilize technologically innovative methods designed to significantly improve recovery of heavy oil resources  including the application of htl tm technology and eor techniques 
in addition  the company seeks to expand its reserve base and production through conventional exploration and production of oil and gas 
our core operations are currently carried out in china  mongolia  canada and ecuador  with business development opportunities worldwide 
in late  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired panasian petroleum inc  and acquired a production sharing contract covering the  square kilometer block xvi exploration area in the nyalga basin mongolia 

table of contents ivanhoe energy s proprietary  patented heavy oil upgrading technology upgrades the quality of heavy oil and bitumen by producing lighter  more valuable crude oil  along with by product energy which can be used to generate steam or electricity 
the htl tm technology has the potential to substantially improve the economics and transportation of heavy oil 
there are significant quantities of heavy oil throughout the world that have not been developed  much of it stranded due to the lack of on site energy  transportation issues  or poor heavy light price differentials 
in remote parts of the world  the considerable reduction in viscosity of the heavy oil through the htl tm process will allow the oil to be transported economically by pipelines 
in addition to a dramatic improvement in oil quality  an htl tm facility can yield large amounts of surplus energy for production of the steam and electricity used in heavy oil production 
the thermal energy from the htl tm process would provide heavy oil producers with an alternative to increasingly volatile prices for natural gas that now is widely used to generate steam 
yields of the low viscosity  upgraded product can be greater than by volume  and high conversion of the heavy residual fraction is achieved 
in addition to the liquid upgraded oil product  a small amount of valuable by product gas is produced  and usable excess heat is generated from the by product coke 
htl tm can virtually eliminate cost exposure to natural gas and diluent  solve the transport challenge  and capture a substantial portion of the heavy to light oil price differential for oil producers 
htl tm accomplishes this at a much smaller scale and at lower per barrel capital costs compared with established competing technologies  using readily available plant and process components 
as htl tm facilities are designed for installation near the wellhead  they eliminate the need for diluent and make large  dedicated upgrading facilities unnecessary 
executive overview of results in july the company disposed of its us operations and used the proceeds for its ongoing projects 
to properly reflect this sale in the company s financial statements the results of the us operations have been segregated from ongoing operations and separately disclosed as discontinued operations 
in the company s oil revenues from continuing operations decreased from million in to million in due primarily to the decline in oil prices between the two years 
these results relate specifically to china producing properties which also experienced a decrease in operating costs from million to million between and this decrease in costs relates to a reduction in the windfall levy a windfall profits tax as defined below  and is also driven by the decline in oil prices between and general and administrative costs increased significantly due to several factors including the company adding key personnel to advance its first htl tm projects and bolster our executive leadership  the redeployment of many of the us staff from their previous duties at our us operations to focus on advancing our heavy oil business development strategy and one time legal and related fees see item to part i of this form k 
the results for discontinued operations was a loss of million  including the write off of a million future income tax asset that could no longer be utilized 
in the first half of  in response to the deteriorating global economy and restricted capital markets  the company focused on husbanding capital while continuing to selectively advance its heavy oil projects in canada and ecuador and develop its htl tm technology 
as a result both tamarack and pungarayacu development activities continued to advance  albeit at a more deliberate pace  and the technology group created a major technical breakthrough in the htl tm process  reducing the amount of oil recycled through a plant by up to percent 
in the second half of the year  as economic conditions moderated somewhat  the company completed two key transactions the acquisition of what we believe to be a high quality exploration block in mongolia s nyalga basin  and a divestiture of our us operations 
these transactions continued to build the company in line with our stated strategies as we redeployed capital from our us conventional operations into our heavy oil projects and built our conventional asset base in our asian operations 
oil and gas integrated projects in this segment will have two primary components 
the first consists of conventional exploration and production activities together with enhanced oil recovery techniques such as steam assisted gravity drainage 
the second component consists of the deployment of the htl tm technology which will be used to upgrade heavy oil at facilities located in the field to produce lighter  more valuable crude 
the company s two flagship projects currently report in this segment a heavy oil project in alberta tamarack and a heavy oil property in ecuador pungarayacu 
conventional the company explores for  develops and produces conventional crude oil and natural gas in china and mongolia  having divested its us operations 
in china  the company s development and production activities are conducted at the dagang oil field located in hebei province and its exploration activities are conducted on the zitong block located in sichuan province 
in mongolia the company is conducting early phase exploration activities in the nyalga basin  southeast of the capital ulaanbaatar 
the company s california and texas exploration  development and production activities were sold to seneca south midway llc 

table of contents business and technology development the company s technology development activities made major strides in the feed stock test facility in san antonio  texas was commissioned in the first quarter and immediately took up its dual roles of supporting business development and continuing to advance the technology 
this facility was a key part of the major technical advancement that eliminated the need to recycle oil through htl tm facilities  greatly reducing capital costs per barrel of throughput 
in addition  the facility also began processing test runs for various heavy oils to support business plans and development opportunities 
business development successes include the disposition of the company s us operations  facilitating capital redeployment from the strategically non core  conventional us arena into our core heavy oil and conventional asian operations 
the panasian merger was also a large advance for our conventional oil and gas strategy  accessing significant exploration opportunities in the asian arena 
additional opportunities in the middle east  north and south america are currently being pursued 
corporate the company s corporate segment consists of costs associated with the board of directors  executive officers  corporate debt  financings and other corporate activities

the decrease in our net loss from to of million was due to a decrease of million in combined oil and gas revenues and realized gain on derivative instruments  a million increase in general and administrative and business and technology development expenses excluding stock based compensation and a million increase in loss from discontinued operations 
these were offset by decreases in operating costs of million  a million expense decrease arising from the impairment of assets and a million increase in future income tax recovery 
our net loss for was million per share compared to our net loss in of million per share 
the decrease in our net loss from to of million was due to an increase of million in combined oil and gas revenues and realized loss on derivative instruments  a million increase in unrealized gain on derivative instruments and a million increase in gain from discontinued operations 
these were offset by an increase in operating costs of million  a million increase in general and administrative and business and technology development expenses excluding stock based compensation and a million expense increase arising from the impairment of assets 

table of contents significant variances in our net losses are explained in the sections that follow 
revenues and operating costs asia oil prices vs 
oil and gas prices decreased per boe in contributing to a million decrease in revenue as compared to we realized an average of per boe during  which was a decrease of per boe from prices 
we expect crude oil prices and natural gas prices to remain volatile in oil prices vs 
oil and gas prices increased per boe in contributing to a million increase in revenue as compared to we realized an average of per boe during  which was an increase of per boe from prices 
realized gain loss on derivatives the increased revenues from higher oil and gas price in were offset by the realized loss on derivatives resulting from settlements from our costless collar derivative instruments 
as benchmark prices rise above the ceiling price established in the contract the company is required to settle monthly see further details on these contracts below under unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments 
changes in these realized settlement gains losses by segment are detailed below year ended favorable year ended favorable year ended december  unfavorable december  unfavorable december  variances variances production volumes the following is a comparison of changes in production volumes for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in and for the year ended december  when compared to the same period for years ended december  years ended december  net boe s percentage net boe s percentage change change china dagang daqing production volumes vs 
net production volumes during decreased by  or mboe  when compared to  resulting in decreased revenues of million 
the reduction was attributed to the normal field decline partially offset by the productivity increases from adding new perforations  fracture stimulations and water flood response 
in addition  the dagang project reached cost recovery effective september   at which time the company s working interest changed from to 
it is anticipated that the gross production rates for will be similar to those averaged in in dagang  at the end of  there were wells producing at a rate of  bopd  compared to producing wells at the end of at  bopd 
production volumes vs 
net production volumes during increased by  or mboe  when compared to  resulting in increased revenues of million 
the normal field decline was offset by the production from five new development wells that were completed and put on production in the second half of  as well as productivity increases from adding new perforations  fracture stimulations and water flood response 

table of contents operating costs vs 
operating costs in china  including engineering support costs and windfall levy  decreased or per boe for when compared to the majority of the decrease relates to an per boe drop in the windfall levy as oil prices decreased substantially from field operating costs decreased per boe 
effective january  the dagang field reached commercial production status as defined by the production sharing contract with china national petroleum company 
the effect of this change is that the company no longer pays of operating costs but now pays only its proportionate interest 
in addition  cost recovery was reached in dagang effective september  during the effect of these two changes resulted in the company paying of operating costs for the first eight months  representing its share based on the commercial production declaration and for the final four months  representing the post cost recovery share 
had the company paid these lower proportionate shares in  field operating costs would have decreased per boe or  from levels 
road and lease maintenance costs  which are weather related  and decreased well workover costs were the main contributing factors to the decrease 
these were offset by increases in oil treatment costs as total fluid volumes increased in in march  the ministry of finance of the peoples republic of china prc issued the administrative measures on collection of windfall gain levy on oil exploitation business the windfall levy measures 
according to the windfall levy measures  effective as of march   enterprises exploiting and selling crude oil in the prc are subject to a windfall gain levy the windfall levy if the monthly weighted average price of crude oil is above per barrel 
the windfall levy is imposed at progressive rates from to on the portion of the weighted average sales price exceeding per barrel 
the cost associated with windfall levy has been included in operating costs in our financial statements 
with oil prices decreasing in  the windfall levy decreased per boe when compared to during the company has been placed on a production quota at our dagang project 
we therefore expect operating costs in to increase on a per barrel basis as compared to the general overall increase is anticipated to be slightly offset with improved maintenance methods currently being implemented in the field 
operating costs vs 
operating costs in china  including engineering and support costs and windfall levy  increased or per boe for when compared to field operating costs increased per boe mainly as a result of a higher percentage of field office costs allocated to operations versus capital as capital activity has decreased 
in addition there were more service rig days worked and higher power costs resulting from greater water injection in when compared to these increases were offset by decreases resulting from road access costs  insurance coverage and lower project management salaries 
as oil prices have increased  the amount of the windfall levy also increased significantly  resulting in per boe increase in when compared to production and operating information including oil and gas revenue  operating costs and depletion  on a per boe basis  are detailed below year ended december  net production boe boe day for the period per boe oil and gas revenue field operating costs windfall levy engineering and support costs net operating revenue depletion net revenue loss from operations

business and technology development expenses decreased million including changes in stock based compensation in when compared to  mainly as a result of a decrease in cdf operating costs due to several heavy oil upgrading runs in the first and second quarters of these decreases were offset by increases in compensation costs as the company assembled a core htl tm technology team 
foreign exchange loss the increase in foreign exchange loss period over period is mainly a result of the unrealized loss on canadian dollar denominated long term debt 
net interest net interest vs

interest expense increased million for when compared to partially due to borrowings under a new loan for our china operations in the fourth quarter of and a short term loan that was outstanding from may to august interest income also increased slightly in when compared to due to cash deposits from the july private placement 
unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments as required by the company s lenders  the company entered into a costless collar derivative to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its dagang field in china over a three year period starting september this derivative had a ceiling price of per barrel and a floor price of per barrel using the wti as the index traded on the nymex 
in december the company paid off the lender s outstanding loan balance and this derivative was subsequently cancelled 

table of contents the company is required to account for these contracts using mark to market accounting 
as forecasted benchmark prices exceed the ceiling prices set in the contract  the contracts have negative value or a liability 
these benchmark prices reached record highs at the beginning of the third quarter of before steadily declining at the end of the fourth quarter to a level that was the lowest dating back several years 
the low benchmark prices continued into the first half of and recovered in the last half of the year 
changes in these unrealized settlement losses and gains by segment are detailed below year ended favorable year ended favorable year ended december  unfavorable december  unfavorable december  variances variances depletion and depreciation the primary expense in this classification is depletion of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties in our china cost centers over the life of their proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent reserve evaluators

asia china s depletion rate decreased per boe for when compared to  resulting in a million decrease in depletion expense for the decrease in the rates from year to year was mainly due to an increase in total estimated proved reserves at our dagang project due to reduced decline rates and improved recovery rates 
a decrease of million in depletion expense from year to year was related to decreased production 
business and technology development depreciation in this segment decreased by million in when compared to due to the company the cdf only being depreciated for the first two quarters in  offset by the commencement of depreciation on the ftf carrying balance 
depletion and depreciation vs 
asia china s depletion rate increased per boe for when compared to  resulting in a million increase in depletion expense for the increase in the rates from year to year was mainly due to an impairment of the drilling and completion costs associated with the second zitong exploration well in the fourth quarter of the remaining increase of million was related to increased production 
business and technology development depreciation of the cdf is calculated using the straight line method over its current useful life which is based on the existing term of the agreement with aera energy llc to use their property to test the cdf 
a formal study was conducted in whereby the estimated salvage value of the property was decreased and the asset retirement obligation was increased resulting in an increased depreciable base 
provision for impairment of intangible asset and development costs during the third quarter of  the company determined that the completion and subsequent improvements to its technology showpiece the ftf in san antonio diminished the business purpose of the cdf to nil 
consequently  the abandonment process commenced and the company has impaired the net carrying value of the costs associated with the cdf as at september  the carrying value  net of depreciation  for the cdf  of million  was reduced to nil with a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 
in addition  the company had million in deferred costs on its balance sheet related to the pursuit of projects in the middle east 
in the fourth quarter of  the entire carrying value of these costs were reduced to nil with a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 

table of contents the company has been pursuing a gtl project for an extended period of time and had not been able to obtain a definitive agreement or appropriate financing 
as a result the company impaired the entire carrying value of the costs associated with gtl as at december  the carrying value for gtl development costs of million and intangible gtl license costs of million have been reduced to nil with a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 
this impairment does not affect the company s intention to continue to pursue the current gtl project in egypt 
in  we had no write downs of our intangible assets or development costs 
write off of deferred financing costs the company incurred professional fees and expenses associated with the pursuit of corporate financing initiatives by the company s chinese subsidiary  sunwing energy 
in the fourth quarter of this financing initiative was postponed indefinitely and therefore the associated costs were written down to nil with a corresponding reduction in our results of operations 
provision for impairment of oil and gas properties as discussed below in this item in critical accounting principles and estimates impairment of proved oil and gas properties  we evaluate each of our cost center s proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
if as a result of this evaluation  a cost center s carrying value exceeds its expected future net cash flows from its proved and probable reserves then a provision for impairment must be recognized in the results of operations 
impairment of oil and gas properties vs 
we did not impair our oil and gas properties in or  compared to million impairment of our china oil and gas properties in provision for recovery of income taxes asia there was a million current tax provision for the year ended december  comprised of million for the tax year and a net adjustment of million for  as compared to a million provision for the same period in in april  the chinese state tax administration bureau issued changes to the minimum depreciation and amortization periods for oil and gas companies 
the minimum period changed form to years and was effective january  consequently  when submitting the final tax return in the second quarter an additional million tax payable was calculated 
business and technology development prior to the company selling its us operating segment in july  as further described in note to the accompany financial statements  the company had future tax assets arising from net operating losses carry forwards generated by this business segment 
these future income tax assets were partially offset by certain future income tax liabilities in the us and by a valuation allowance 
as at june   as a result of the pending sale of the business segment  the company was no longer able to offset these tax assets and liabilities but was required to present these future income tax assets as assets from discontinued operations and a future income tax liability both in the amount of million in the june  balance sheet 
the future income tax assets classified as assets from discontinued operations were ultimately included in the million loss on disposition as described in note revisions were made to the future income tax liability during the third quarter of based on revised projections of taxable income and utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
as at december   the company s future income tax liability is million in the accompanying balance sheet 
net income loss from discontinued operations the following applies to the u

the increased revenues from higher oil and gas prices in were offset by the realized loss on derivatives resulting from settlements from our costless collar derivative instruments 
as benchmark prices rise above the ceiling price established in the contract the company is required to settle monthly see further details on these contracts below under unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments 
the company realized a net loss on these settlements in of million  which compares to a realized net loss in of million 
production volumes from the us operations we produced mboe compared to mboe produced in this decrease was due to the sale of these us operations midway through there was a increase in us production volume for as compared to and accounted for million of our increased revenues 
the overall changes to the us production volumes were mainly due to the first quarter drilling program at south midway 
in addition  an increase in production in was due to increased steaming in the first two months of and abnormal downtimes in the steaming operations in due the absence of our two steam generators for extended period of time 
the purchase of a second steam generator and the retrofit of an existing generator allowed for a full steaming program in operating costs field operating costs decreased per boe in mainly due management redeploying technical personnel assigned to this segment to other segments in anticipation of the sale of these operations 
field operating costs increased per boe in mainly due to an increase in steaming operations at south midway 
both steam generators were down in the latter part of the first quarter and through the second quarter of in addition  the price of natural gas has been significantly higher in when compared to 
table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased significantly in when compared to  in part because these us operations were sold midway through and in part due to non field assets and personnel being transferred to the parent company 
general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to the increase in was mainly resulting from a lower allocation to capital and operations  provision for uncollectible accounts related to certain joint interest billings  offset by reallocation of staff to business and technology development 
net interest interest expense increased for and when compared to prior years due to additional draws on our loan facility 
unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments as required by the company s lenders  the company entered into costless collar derivatives to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its south midway property in california and spraberry property in west texas over a two year period starting november and a six month period starting november the derivatives have a ceiling price of  and  per barrel and a floor price of  and  per barrel  respectively  using wti as the index traded on the nymex

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows from continuing and discontinued operations for the periods indicated year ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements  we have losses from operations  negative cash flows from operations and have a substantial accumulated deficit 
historically  we have principally used external sources to fund operations  to fund acquisitions of oil and gas properties and projects  to service long term liabilities and to develop our technology and major projects 
the main source of funds historically has been public and private equity and debt markets 
the company s cash flow from operating activities will not be sufficient to meet its operating and capital obligations  and as such  the company intends to finance its operating and capital projects from a combination of strategic investors in its projects and or public and private debt and equity markets  either at a parent company level or at a project level 

table of contents principal factors that could affect our ability to obtain funds from external sources include inability to attract strategic investors to our projects  volatility in the public debt and private and equity markets  increases in interest rates or credit spreads  as well as limitations on the availability of credit  that affect our ability to borrow under future potential credit facilities on a secured or unsecured basis  and a decrease in the market price for our common stock 
operating activities our operating activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million and million provided in the same periods in and the decrease in cash from operating activities for the year ended december  was mainly due to the significant decrease in oil and gas production prices offset by an increase in expenses 
the increase in cash from operating activities for the year ended december  was mainly due to a increase in oil and gas production prices offset by an increase in expenses  as well as an increase in changes in non cash working capital when compared to investing activities our investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in and million for for  the main reason for the differences is million cash provided by discontinued operations which is mainly the proceeds from the sale of these operations 
for  the main reason for the differences is the million paid as part of the cost of the acquisition of the working interests in two leases located in the athabasca oil sands region in the province of alberta  canada see note in the accompanying financial statements for more details 
in addition the company received million in proceeds from a recovery of development costs in  compared to nil in and there was also an increase in capital asset expenditures of million for as compared to and a decrease of million for when compared to changes in capital investments by segment are detailed below for the year ended for the year ended december  december  increase increase decrease decrease oil and gas activities canada ecuador asia business and technology development corporate canada as noted above  two leases located in canada were acquired in the third quarter of capital investments during both years consisted of seismic ert  environmental work and capitalized interest 
ecuador the increase of investment activities in is due to the signing of a contract in october to explore and develop ecuador s pungarayacu heavy oil field using our htl tm technology including the completion of environmental assessment activities  the receipt of environmental permits and licenses in may and preliminary costs related to the start of appraisal drilling activities in the third quarter ended september  the first well was spud during the fourth quarter 
table of contents asia capital asset expenditures decreased million in as compared to the expenditures in the dagang field decreased million in compared to period as fewer fracture stimulations  and an associated decrease in field office cost allocations  were performed in versus expenditures in the sichuan project decreased slightly from levels by million for compared to due to lower personnel costs and less seismic interpretation costs 
drilling is to commence in the second quarter of with expected completed drilling  completion and evaluation of the prospects finalized in late the decrease in investment in this segment in compared to was the result of a million decrease in capital spending at zitong and a million decrease in capital spending at dagang 
spending at zitong during was limited to expenditures relating to the commencement of the second phase of the exploration program which were relatively minor compared to the drilling and completion costs incurred during for completing the first phase of the program which was concluded in december at dagang  we spud five new development wells in compared to where we only completed a series of fracture stimulation projects 
business and technology development the decrease in capital spending during when compared to was due to the timing of costs relating to the construction and delivery of the ftf 
additionally  in there were modifications to the ftf to provide the capacity for longer term runs and enhance the facility s intellectual property development capabilities 
the decrease in capital spending during when compared to was due to the timing of costs relating to the construction and delivery of the ftf 
discontinued operations there was minimal capital activity in the million increase in us capital spending in compared to was mainly due to the eight well drilling program at south midway in compared to the cost of a new steam generator in financing activities financing activities for consisted mainly of the final debt payments of long term notes and the repayment of a note associated with discontinued operations 
financing activities for the year ended december  consisted mainly of an equity private placement in the third quarter of in july  the company completed a cdn 
million private placement consisting of  special warrants special warrants at cdn 
per special warrant the offering 
each special warrant entitled the holder to one common share of the company upon exercise of the special warrant 
in august  all of the special warrants were exercised for  common shares 
the net proceeds from the offering of the special warrants was approximately cdn 
million 
in addition  in april  the company obtained a loan from a third party finance company in the amount of cdn 
million bearing interest at per annum 
at the lender s option the principal and accrued and unpaid interest was converted in august into the company s common shares at a conversion price of cdn 
per share 
these cash inflows were offset by million in professional fees and expenses associated with the pursuit of corporate financing initiatives by the company s chinese subsidiary  sunwing energy and the payment at maturity on december  of a promissory note to talisman in the principal amount of cdn 
million plus accrued interest 
financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of three draws totaling million million net of financing costs on two separate loan facilities  one associated with our discontinued operations 
this increase in borrowings was offset by scheduled debt payments of million 
financing activities in also consisted of million received from the exercise of warrants compared to when there were no warrants exercised but there was a million private placement of common shares 

table of contents outlook for our capital program budget ranges from approximately million to million and will encompass the following a continued advancement of the tamarack and pungarayacu heavy oil developments  b exploration drilling in the zitong prospect in sichuan province  china  and c selected engineering and development costs related to the enhancement of our proprietary htl tm oil upgrading technology  d minor maintenance in the dagang oil field  hebei province china 
management s plans for financing its requirements and beyond include a recent special warrant private placement  as outlined in note to the accompanying financial statements and  for the longer term  the potential for alliances or other arrangements with strategic partners as well as future traditional project financing  debt and mezzanine financing or the sale of equity securities 
discussions with potential strategic partners are focused primarily on national oil companies and other sovereign or government entities from asian and middle eastern countries that have approached the company and expressed interest in participating in the company s heavy oil activities in ecuador  canada and around the world 
however  no assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into one or more alternative business alliances with other parties or raise additional capital 
if we are unable to enter into such business alliances or obtain adequate additional financing  we will be required to curtail our operations  which may include the sale of assets 
in addition to tamarack and pungarayacu  the company will continue to pursue ongoing discussions related to other htl heavy oil opportunities in canada  north and south america  the middle east and north africa

critical accounting principles and estimates our accounting principles are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap in canada  which conform in all material respects to us gaap except for those items disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for us readers  we have detailed the differences and have also provided a reconciliation of the differences between canadian and us gaap in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  revenue recognition  fair market value of derivatives  allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
full cost accounting we follow canadian institute of chartered accountants cica handbook accounting guideline oil and gas accounting full cost acg in accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all exploration and development costs associated with lease and royalty interest acquisition  geological and geophysical activities  carrying charges for unproved properties  drilling both successful and unsuccessful wells  gathering and production facilities and equipment  financing  administrative costs directly related to capital projects and asset retirement costs are capitalized on a country by country cost center basis 

table of contents the other generally accepted method of accounting for costs incurred for oil and gas properties is the successful efforts method 
under this method  costs associated with land acquisition and geological and geophysical activities are expensed in the year incurred and the costs of drilling unsuccessful wells are expensed upon abandonment 
as a consequence of following the full cost method of accounting  we may be more exposed to potential impairments if the carrying value of a cost center s oil and gas properties exceeds its estimated future net cash flows than if we followed the successful efforts method of accounting 
impairment may occur if a cost center s recoverable reserve estimates decrease  oil and natural gas prices decline or capital  operating and income taxes increase to levels that would significantly affect its estimated future net cash flows 
see impairment of proved oil and gas properties below 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of reserves is inherently uncertain and complex 
it requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
our reserve estimates are based on current production forecasts  prices and existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations 
reserve numbers and values are only estimates and you should not assume that the present value of our future net cash flows from these estimates is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
reserve estimates are critical to many accounting estimates and financial decisions including determining whether or not an exploratory well has found economically recoverable reserves 
such determinations involve the commitment of additional capital to develop the field based on current estimates of production forecasts  prices and other economic conditions 
calculating our unit of production depletion rates 
proved reserves are used to determine rates that are applied to each unit of production in calculating our depletion expense 
assessing our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
estimated future net cash flows used to assess impairment of our oil and gas properties are determined using proved and probable reserves 
see impairment of proved oil and gas properties below 
management is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and preparing related disclosures 
estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with sec requirements set out in the definitions in regulation s x and the rules in regulation s k  generally accepted industry practices in the us as promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers  and the standards of the coge handbook modified to reflect sec requirements 
for details on our reserve estimation process please refer section titled internal control over reserve reporting in item and of this form k 
the estimated discounted future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves included in the supplementary financial information are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows will also be affected by factors such as actual production levels and timing  and changes in governmental regulation or taxation  and may differ materially from estimated cash flows 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which  together with proved reserves  are as likely as not to be recovered 
depletion as indicated previously  our estimate of proved reserves are critical to calculating our unit of production depletion rates 
another critical factor affecting our depletion rate is our determination that an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties has occurred 
costs incurred on an unproved oil and gas property are excluded from the depletion rate calculation until it is determined whether proved reserves are attributable to an unproved oil and gas property or upon determination that an unproved oil and gas property has been impaired 
an unproved oil and gas property would likely be impaired if  for example  a dry hole has been drilled and there are no firm plans to continue drilling on the property 
also  the likelihood of partial or total impairment of a property increases as the expiration of the lease term approaches and there are no plans to drill on the property or to extend the term of the lease 
we assess each of our unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that an unproved oil and gas property has been totally or partially impaired we include all or a portion of the accumulated costs incurred for that unproved oil and gas property in the calculation of our unit of production depletion rate 

table of contents our depletion rate is also affected by our estimates of future costs to develop the proved reserves 
we estimate future development costs using quoted prices  historical costs and trends 
it is difficult to predict prices for materials and services required to develop a field particularly over a period of years with rising oil and gas prices during which there is generally increased competition for a limited number of suppliers 
we update our estimates of future costs to develop our proved reserves on a quarterly basis 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties we evaluate each of our cost centers proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the basis for calculating the amount of impairment is different for canadian and us gaap purposes 
for canadian gaap  acg requires recognition and measurement processes to assess impairment of oil and gas properties ceiling test 
in the recognition of an impairment  the carrying value of a cost center is compared to the undiscounted future net cash flows of that cost center s proved reserves using estimates of future oil and gas prices and costs plus the cost of unproved properties that have been excluded from the depletion calculation 
if the carrying value is greater than the value of the undiscounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves plus the cost of unproved properties excluded from the depletion calculation  then the amount of the cost center s potential impairment must be measured 
a cost center s impairment loss is measured by the amount its carrying value exceeds the discounted future net cash flows of its proved and probable reserves using estimates of future oil and gas prices and costs plus the cost of unproved properties that have been excluded from the depletion calculation and which contain no probable reserves 
the net cash flows of a cost center s proved and probable reserves are discounted using a risk free interest rate adjusted for political and economic risk on a country by country basis 
the amount of the impairment loss is recognized as a charge to the results of operations and a reduction in the net carrying amount of a cost center s oil and gas properties 
for us gaap  we follow the requirements of the sec s regulation s x article c for determining the limitation of capitalized costs 
accordingly  the carrying value of a cost center s oil and gas properties cannot exceed the a present value of estimated future net revenues computed by applying average  first day of the month price during the month period before the end of the year prices of oil and gas reserves with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves computed using a discount factor of ten percent and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions plus b the cost of properties not being amortized eg major development projects and c the lower of cost or fair value of unproven properties included in the costs being amortized less d income tax effects related to the difference between the book and tax basis of the properties referred to in b and c above 
if unamortized capitalized costs within a cost center exceed this limit  the excess is charged as a provision for impairment in the statement of operations 
amounts thus required to be written off shall not be reinstated for any subsequent increase in the cost center ceiling 
unproved properties and major development projects are assessed on a quarterly basis for possible impairments or reductions in value 
if a reduction in value has occurred  the impairment is transferred to the carrying value of proved oil and gas properties 
for canadian gaap  the carrying value includes all capitalized costs for each cost center  including costs associated with asset retirement net of estimated salvage values  unproved properties and major development projects  less accumulated depletion and ceiling test impairments 
this is essentially the same definition according to us gaap  under regulation s x  except that the carrying value of assets should be net of deferred income taxes and costs of major development projects are to be considered separately for purposes of the ceiling test calculation 
asset retirement obligations for canadian gaap  we follow cica handbook section  asset retirement obligations which requires asset retirement costs and liabilities associated with site restoration and abandonment of tangible long lived assets be initially measured at a fair value which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire such assets 
the fair value is recognized in the financial statements at the present value of expected future cash outflows to satisfy the obligation 
subsequent to the initial measurement  the effect of the passage of time on the liability for the asset retirement obligation accretion expense and the amortization of the asset retirement cost are recognized in the results of operations 
we measure the expected costs required to retire our producing us oil and gas properties at a fair value  which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to abandon the field and restore the site 
we do not make such a provision for our oil and gas operations in china as there is no obligation on our part to contribute to the future cost to abandon the field and restore the site 
asset retirement costs are depleted using the unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves and are included with depletion and depreciation expense 
the accretion of the liability for the asset retirement obligation is included with interest expense

table of contents research and development we incur various expenses in the pursuit of htl tm and gtl projects  including htl tm technology for heavy oil processing  throughout the world 
for canadian gaap  such expenses incurred prior to signing a mou  or similar agreements  are considered to be business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations as incurred 
upon executing a mou to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of a project  including studies for the marketability of the projects products  we assess that the feasibility and related costs incurred have potential future value  are probable of leading to a definitive agreement for the exploitation of proved reserves and should be capitalized 
if no definitive agreement is reached  then the capitalized costs  which are deemed to have no future value  are written down to our results of operations with a corresponding reduction in our investments in htl tm or gtl assets 
additionally  we incur costs to develop  enhance and identify improvements in the application of the htl tm and gtl technologies we license or own 
we follow cica handbook section  goodwill and intangible assets  s 
in accounting for the development costs of equipment and facilities acquired or constructed for such purposes 
development costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected economic life of the equipment or facilities commencing with the start up of commercial operations for which the equipment or facilities are intended 
we review the recoverability of such capitalized development costs annually  or as changes in circumstances indicate the development costs might be impaired  through an evaluation of the expected future discounted cash flows from the associated projects 
if the carrying value of such capitalized development costs exceeds the expected future discounted cash flows  the excess is written down to the results of operations with a corresponding reduction in the investments in htl tm and gtl assets 
costs incurred in the operation of equipment and facilities used to develop or enhance htl tm and gtl technologies prior to commencing commercial operations are business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations in the period incurred 
for us gaap  we follow asc topic research and development formerly sfas no 
 research and development 
as with canadian gaap  costs of equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities are capitalized as tangible assets and amortized over the expected economic life of the equipment or facilities commencing with the start up of commercial operations for which the equipment or facilities are intended 
however  for us gaap such facilities must have alternative future uses to be capitalized 
as with canadian gaap  expenses incurred in the operation of research and development equipment or facilities prior to commencing commercial operations are business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations in the period incurred 
the major difference for us gaap purposes is that feasibility  marketing and related costs incurred prior to executing a definitive agreement are considered to be research and development costs and are expensed as incurred 
intangible assets our intangible assets consists of the underlying value of an exclusive  irrevocable license to deploy  worldwide  the rtp tm process for petroleum applications htl tm technology as well as the exclusive right to deploy the rtp tm process in all applications other than biomass and a master license from syntroleum permitting us to use the syntroleum process in an unlimited number of projects around the world 
for canadian gaap  we follow s 
whereby intangible assets  acquired individually or with a group of other assets  are initially recognized and measured at cost 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives whereas intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized unless it is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life 
intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value or expected future discounted cash flows  the excess is written down to the results of operations with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
the htl tm technology and the syntroleum gtl master license have finite lives  which correlate with the useful lives of the facilities we expect to develop that will use the technologies 
the amount of the carrying value of the technologies we assign to each facility will be amortized to earnings on a basis related to the operations of the facility from the date on which the facility is placed into service 
we evaluate the carrying values of the htl tm technology and the syntroleum gtl master license annually  or as changes in circumstances indicate the intangible assets might be impaired  based on an assessment of its fair market value

accounting changes in february  the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica issued handbook section  goodwill and intangible assets  s 
replacing handbook section  goodwill and other intangible assets s 
and handbook section  research and development costs 
s 
is applicable to financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after october  the new section establishes standards for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of goodwill subsequent to its initial recognition and of intangible assets by profit oriented enterprises 
standards concerning goodwill are unchanged from the standards included in the previous s 

table of contents also in february  the cica amended portions of handbook section  financial statement concepts  which the cica concluded permitted deferral of costs that did not meet the definition of an asset 
the amendments apply to annual and interim financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after october  upon adoption of s 
and the amendments to section on january   capitalized amounts that no longer meet the definition of an asset are expensed retrospectively 
the company adopted the new standards on january  with no transitional adjustment to the consolidated financial statements as a result of having adopted these standards 
in june  the acsb issued accounting revisions release no 
 improving disclosures about financial instruments background information and basis for conclusions amendments to financial instruments disclosures  section  which amended certain disclosure requirements related to financial instrument disclosure in response to disclosure amendments issued by the international accounting standards board 
this is consistent with the acsb s strategy to adopt ifrs and to ensure the current existing disclosure requirements for financial instruments are converged to the extent possible 
the new disclosure standards require disclosure of fair values based on a fair value hierarchy as well as enhanced discussion and quantitative disclosure related to liquidity risk 
the amended disclosure requirements are effective for annual financial statements relating to fiscal years ending after september  and as such the company has included the required disclosure in note for the year ending december  impact of new and pending canadian gaap accounting standards in january  the emerging issues committee of the cica eic issued emerging issues committee abstract  credit risk and the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities which provides guidance on the implications of credit risk in determining the fair value of an entity s financial assets and financial liabilities 
the guidance clarifies that an entity s own credit risk and the credit risk of counterparties should be taken into account in determining the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities  including derivative instruments  for presentation and disclosure purposes 
the conclusions of the eic were effective from the date of issuance of the abstract and did not have any material impact on the company s consolidated balance sheet or statement of operations  comprehensive loss and accumulated deficit 
however  the company s fair value disclosures in note incorporated this new guidance 
also in january  the accounting standards board of the cica acsb issued handbook section  business combinations s 
replacing handbook section  business combinations 
the acsb revised accounting standards in regards to business combinations with the intent of harmonizing those standards with ifrs 
the revised standards require the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establish the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and require the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
these standards shall be applied prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after january  the company adopted this standard early on january  with no transitional adjustment to the consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting this standard 
however  the company did apply the provisions of this standard to a business combination that occurred in the fourth quarter of see note 
also in january  the acsb issued handbook section  consolidated financial statements s 
and handbook section  non controlling interests s  which replace handbook section  consolidated financial statements s 
s 
and s 
require all entities to report non controlling minority interests as equity in consolidated financial statements 
the standards eliminate the diversity that currently exists in accounting for transactions between an entity and non controlling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
these standards shall be applied retrospectively effective for interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after january  the company adopted these standards early on january  with no transitional adjustment to the consolidated financial statements as a result of adopting these standards 

table of contents convergence of canadian gaap with international financial reporting standards transition to international financial reporting standards the canadian accounting standards board acsb announced that canadian generally accepted accounting principles gaap no longer apply for all publically accountable enterprises as of january  for interim and annual periods beginning on or after january   the company will be required to report under international financial reporting standards ifrs as set out by the international accounting standards board iasb 
comparative ifrs information for the fiscal year will also have to be reported for interim and annual consolidated financial statements issued during and thus the company s transition date to ifrs will be january  any adjustments resulting from a change in policy as a result of the transition to ifrs will be applied retroactively with corresponding adjustment to the company s opening retained earnings on january  the company is currently evaluating the impact of these new standards 
the implementation of ifrs may result in a significant impact on our accounting policies  measurements and disclosures 
ifrs transition overview the company is in the process of evaluating the potential impact of ifrs to its consolidated financial statements 
this will be an ongoing process as the iasb and the acsb issue new standards and recommendations and as the canadian accounting profession interprets those standards and recommendations 
the company s consolidated financial performance and financial position as disclosed in the current canadian gaap consolidated financial statements may be significantly different when presented in accordance with ifrs 
additionally  the company is a foreign private issuer as defined in rule b c under the united states securities exchange act of  as amended 
historically  the company has voluntarily filed on domestic forms forms k  q and k with the united states securities exchange commission sec and has presented its consolidated financial statements using canadian gaap in us dollars  with a reconciliation to us gaap 
the sec issued rule which allows foreign private issuers that voluntarily file on domestic forms to file financial statements prepared under ifrs as issued by the iasb without reconciliation to us gaap 
accordingly  upon transition to ifrs on january   the company will not provide a reconciliation to us gaap in its interim or annual consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified ifrs versus current canadian gaap differences and various policy choices available under ifrs  but continues to assess the implications of such differences and policy choices to its financial reporting 
at this time  the company cannot quantify the impact that the future adoption of ifrs will have on its consolidated financial performance and financial position  however  the impact may be material 
the company also expects the transition to ifrs to impact disclosure controls and procedures  and information and technology systems and processes 
while ifrs may also affect internal controls over financial reporting  management does not currently expect such changes to be significant 
additional information will be provided by the company in quarterly reports issued during ifrs conversion plan the company has established a formal project governance structure with oversight by its ifrs steering committee  consisting of senior management 
the ifrs steering committee provides periodic updates of the status and effectiveness of the ifrs conversion plan to the company s senior executives and audit committee

table of contents impact of adoption of ifrs adoption of ifrs will initially require retrospective application as of the january  transition date  on the basis that an entity has prepared its financial statements in accordance with ifrs since its formation 
certain adoptive relief mechanisms are available under ifrs to assist with difficulties associated with reformulating historical accounting information 
the general relief mechanism is to allow for prospective  rather than retrospective treatment  under certain conditions as prescribed by ifrs  first time adoption of international financial reporting standards 
this standard specifies that adjustments arising on the conversion to ifrs from canadian gaap should be recognized in opening retained earnings 
ifrs first time adoption of international financial reporting standards ifrs the adoption of ifrs requires application of ifrs  which provides guidance for an entity s initial adoption of ifrs 
ifrs generally requires an entity to apply all ifrs s effective at the beginning of its first ifrs reporting period retrospectively 
however  ifrs provides certain mandatory exceptions and permits limited optional exemptions in specified areas of certain ifrs standards from this general requirement 
the most relevant first time adoption exemptions and elections available under ifrs which will impact the company are discussed below oil and gas assets in october  the iasb issued an exemption for oil and gas companies  which follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations  to use their canadian gaap net book values of their oil and gas assets for their opening balances when transitioning to ifrs 
the oil and gas assets will need to be categorized separately on the company s balance sheet as intangible exploration and evaluation assets in accordance with ifrs exploration for and evaluation of mineral resources ifrs and oil and gas properties and equipment in accordance with ias property  plant and equipment ias as discussed further below 
oil and gas properties and equipment are to include development and production assets the canadian gaap net book value of which are to be allocated to cash generating units cgu s as defined in ias impairment of assets ias based on either proved reserves or proved plus probable reserves at the discretion of the company 
the opening book values of the cgu s will be subject to an impairment test as provide for in ias and any impairment will be charged to opening retained earnings 
the company has elected to adopt the deemed cost exemption provided to full cost oil and gas companies and believes this exemption will significantly decrease the impact to the company s opening balance financial statements presented in accordance with ifrs and the effort required to transition to ifrs 
property plant and equipment non oil and gas and intangible assets ifrs allows an entity to initially measure an item of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets upon transition to ifrs at fair value as deemed cost as opposed to full retroactive application of the cost model under ias and ias intangible assets ias 
under this option  fair value as deemed cost will become the new cost amount for qualifying assets at transition 
as stated above the company will elect to adopt the specific deemed cost exemption as it relates to its oil and gas assets 
however  for the company s non oil and gas property plant and equipment  such as its feedstock test facility  the company has elected to apply the full retroactive application of the cost model under ias in establishing opening balances of its non oil and gas property plant and equipment 

table of contents the company s intangible assets consist of htl tm technology and rights which were acquired as part of the business combination with ensyn in april as stated below under business combinations  the company has elected to apply the requirements of ifrs business combinations ifrs prospectively and as a result the recorded value of the intangible assets for canadian gaap will be equal to the opening balance upon the transition to ifrs subject to a fair value less costs to sell or value in use impairment test as required by ias business combinations in the transition to ifrs  entities may elect to apply the requirements of ifrs retrospectively or prospectively from the date of transition to ifrs or to restate all business combinations after a selected date 
retrospective application would require an entity to restate all prior transactions that meet the definition of a business combination under ifrs 
the company has elected to rely upon the exemption provided for in ifrs and apply the requirements of ifrs prospectively and has also decided to early adopt  effective january   canadian institute of chartered accountants cica handbook section business combinations  handbook section consolidated financial statements  handbook section non controlling interests for canadian gaap purposes as well as the financial accounting standards board s fasb r business combinations for us gaap purposes as these new standards are consistent with ifrs decommissioning liabilities asset retirement obligations international financial reporting interpretations committee ifric requires that changes in an existing decommissioning  restoration or similar liability are added to or deducted from the cost of the related asset and the adjusted cost base are amortized over the remaining useful life of those assets 
application of ifric would require the company to complete a historical summary of all such changes that would have been made in relation to a decommissioning liability from inception of that liability and reflect the cumulative changes in the net book value of the related asset on transition to ifrs 
however  the exemption available under ifrs would allow an entity to include in the depreciated cost of the related asset an amount calculated by discounting the decommissioning liability for that asset at the date of transition to ifrs back to  and depreciating it from  when the liability was first incurred 
the company has elected to adopt the exemption available under ifrs with regard to its decommissioning liabilities 
share based payments on initial adoption of ifrs  an entity is not required under ifrs share based payments ifrs to recognize share based payments settled before the entity s ifrs transition date 
generally  an entity may elect prospective application for stock options granted on or after november   or for stock options granted after november  that vested before the later of the date of transition to ifrs or january  the company has elected to apply the transition provisions of ifrs which would require that ifrs be applied only to equity instruments and liabilities arising from share based payments stock options that are not fully vested on the date of transition to ifrs 
this election will have no impact on opening balances on january  but would affect the expensing of stock options during and thereafter as stock options must be expensed on a graded vesting schedule in accordance with ifrs rather than on a straight line basis as has been applied by the company for canadian gaap and us gaap purposes 
ifrs allows for certain other optional exemptions  however  the company does not expect such exemptions to be significant to the company s initial adoption of ifrs 
impact of new and pending us gaap accounting standards in june  the fasb issued guidance now codified as asc topic  generally accepted accounting principles  as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap

in april  the fasb issued guidance in the asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures formerly fasb staff position fsp fas of the codification on determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the guidance emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity  the objective of a fair value measurement remains the same 
fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants 
the guidance provides a number of factors to consider when evaluating whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability in relation to normal market activity 
in addition  when transactions or quoted prices are not considered orderly  adjustments to those prices based on the weight of available information may be needed to determine the appropriate fair value

asu requires entities to measure the fair value of liabilities using one or more of several prescribed valuation techniques within the asu when quoted prices in an active market for the identical liability are not available 
the asu also clarifies that entities are not required to include separate inputs or adjustments to other inputs relating to the existence of restrictions that prevent the transfer of liabilities when estimating their fair value  and quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities at the measurement date and the quoted prices for identical liabilities traded as assets in active markets when adjustments to the quoted prices of assets are required are level fair value measurements 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us  or our related parties  except as disclosed herein 

table of contents related party transactions the company has entered into agreements with a number of entities which are related or controlled through common directors or shareholders 
these entities provide access to an aircraft  the services of administrative and technical personnel  and office space or facilities in vancouver  london and singapore 
the company is billed on a cost recovery basis in most cases 
for the year ended december  the costs incurred in the normal course of business with respect to the above arrangements amounted to million million for and million for  and have been measured at their exchange amount and are recorded in general and administrative and business and technology expense in the statement of operations 
as at december  amounts included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the balance sheet under these arrangements were million million at december  
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to normal market risks inherent in the oil and gas business  including equity market risk  commodity price risk  foreign currency rate risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we recognize these risks and manage our operations to minimize our exposures to the extent practicable 
non trading equity market risks we currently have limited production in china  which have not generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our exploration and development activities 
historically  we have relied on the equity markets as the primary source of capital to fund our expansion and growth opportunities 
based on our current plans  we estimate that we will need approximately to million to fund our capital investment programs for we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing as and when needed 
factors beyond our control  such as the recent credit crisis  may make it difficult or impossible for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
failure to obtain any required financing on a timely basis may cause us to postpone our development plans  forfeit rights in some or all of our projects or reduce or terminate some or all of our operations 
commodity price risk commodity price risk related to crude oil prices is one of our most significant market risk exposures 
crude oil prices and quality differentials are influenced by worldwide factors such as the recent credit crisis  opec actions  political events and supply and demand fundamentals 
to a lesser extent we are also exposed to natural gas price movements 
natural gas prices are generally influenced by oil prices  north american supply and demand and local market conditions 
based on the company s estimated worldwide crude oil production levels  a bbl change in the price of oil  would increase or decrease net income and cash from operations for by million 
we periodically engage in the use of derivatives to minimize variability in our cash flow from operations and currently have costless collar contracts put in place as part of our bank loan facilities the company entered into a costless collar derivative to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its dagang field in china over a three year period starting september this derivative had a ceiling price of per barrel and a floor price of per barrel using wti as the index traded on the nymex 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company had no open positions on the derivatives mentioned above as it had paid off the bank loan and settled all outstanding derivative contracts 
decreases in oil and natural gas prices would negatively impact our results of operations as a direct result of a reduction in revenues but may also do so in the ceiling test calculation for the impairment of our oil and gas properties 
on a quarterly basis  we compare the value of our proved and probable reserves  using estimated future oil and gas prices  to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
the ceiling test calculation is sensitive to oil and gas prices and in a period of declining prices could result in a charge to our results of operations as we experienced in when we recorded a million provision for impairment for canadian gaap and an additional million for us gaap mainly due to a decline in oil and gas prices 
decreases in oil and gas prices from those used in our ceiling test calculation as at december  as discussed above in critical accounting principles and estimates impairment of proved oil and gas properties may result in additional impairment provisions of our oil and gas properties 
the recoverable value of probable reserves is included only for the measurement of the impairment of the carrying value of oil and gas properties as required under canadian gaap but not for us gaap 
additionally  there are differences for us gaap see critical accounting principles and estimates for the difference between canadian and us gaap in calculating the impairment provision for oil and gas properties 

table of contents foreign currency rate risk foreign currency risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial commitment  recognized asset or liability will fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency rates 
the main underlying economic currency of the company s cash flows is the us dollar 
this is because the company s major product  crude oil  is priced internationally in us dollars 
accordingly  the company does not expect to face foreign exchange risks associated with its production revenues 
however  some of the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
the majority of the operating costs incurred in the chinese operations are paid in chinese renminbi 
the majority of costs incurred in the administrative offices in vancouver and calgary  as well as some business development costs  are paid in canadian dollars 
in addition  with the recent property acquisition in alberta see note the company s canadian dollar expenditures increased during the last half of and when compared to prior periods  along with an increase in cash and debt balances denominated in canadian dollars 
disbursement transactions denominated in chinese renminbi and canadian dollars are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date 
foreign currency gains and losses also come about when monetary assets and liabilities  mainly short term payables and receivables  denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month 
the estimated impact of a strengthening or weakening of the chinese renminbi  and canadian dollar  as of december  on net loss and accumulated deficit for the year ended december  is a million increase  and a million decrease  respectively 
to help reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency risk it seeks to maximize the expenditures and contracts denominated in us dollars and minimize those denominated in other currencies  except for its canadian activities where it attempts to hold cash denominated in canadian dollars in order to manage its currency risk related to outstanding debt and current liabilities denominated in canadian dollars 
interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to the risk that the value of a financial instrument or cash flows associated with the instrument will fluctuate due to the changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from interest bearing borrowings which have a variable interest rate 
during  the company had a bank loan facility as noted above this loan facility was repaid in full in december and a convertible note with fluctuating interest rates 
the company estimates that its net loss and accumulated deficit for the year ended december  would have changed million for every change in interest rates as of december  the company is not currently actively attempting to mitigate this interest rate risk given the limited amount and term of its borrowings and the current global interest rate environment 
credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk with respect to its cash held with financial institutions  accounts receivable  derivative contracts and advance balances 
the company believes its exposure to credit risk related to cash held with financial institutions is minimal due to the quality of the institutions where the cash is held and the nature of the deposit instruments 
most of the company s accounts receivable balances relate to oil sales to foreign national petroleum companies and are exposed to typical industry credit risks 
in addition  accounts receivable balances consist of costs billed to joint venture partners where the company is the operator and advances to partners for joint operations where the company is not the operator 
the company manages its credit risk by entering into sales contracts only with established entities and reviewing its exposure to individual entities on a regular basis 
currently  all of the company s revenues come from cnpc and of the outstanding receivable balances as at december  and  respectively  are due from this same customer 
included in the company s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of nil as of the year ended december  which are past due at the reporting date for which the company has not provided an allowance  as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable 
in addition  the company recorded an allowance for the entire outstanding amount of million related to an amount owed to the company by a two separate joint interest partners in the fourth quarter of these provisions were recorded in general and administrative expense in the accompanying statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
there were no other changes to the allowance for credit losses account during the three month period ended december  and no other losses associated with credit risk were recorded during this same period 

table of contents liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the company s business activities may not be available  which means it may be forced to sell financial assets or non financial assets  refinance existing debt  raise new debt or issue equity 
the company s present plans to generate sufficient resources to assure continuation of its operations and achieve its capital investment objectives include alliances or other arrangements with entities with the resources to support the company s projects as well as project financing  debt financing or the sale of equity securities 
however  the availability of financing  in particular project funding  is dependent in part on our ability to fund our projects using the credit and equity markets 
despite the company s recent successful financing efforts see note to the financial statements included in item of this form k  the terms and availability of equity and debt capital  have been materially restricted and financing may not be available when it is required or on commercially acceptable terms 
trading we do not enter into contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had entered into such contracts
