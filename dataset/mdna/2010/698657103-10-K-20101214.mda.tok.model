item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations before making a decision to invest in our securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations in the future 
if any such risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our securities could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our industry the convenience store and retail fuel industries are highly competitive and impacted by new entrants 
increased competition could result in lower margins 
the convenience store and retail fuel industries in the geographic areas in which we operate are highly competitive and marked by ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering the products and services found in our stores 
we compete with numerous other convenience store chains  independent convenience stores  supermarkets  drugstores  discount clubs  fuel service stations  mass merchants  fast food operations and other similar retail outlets 
in recent years  several non traditional retailers  including supermarkets  club stores and mass merchants  have begun to compete directly with convenience stores 
these non traditional fuel retailers have obtained a significant share of the fuel market and their market share is expected to grow  and these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts  both at the fuel pump and in the store  to encourage in store merchandise sales and fuel sales 
increased value consciousness among consumers has accelerated sales declines as consumers turn to dollar stores and big box stores to fulfill needs that were traditionally fulfilled by convenience stores 
additionally  in some of our markets  our competitors have been in existence longer and have greater financial  marketing and other resources than we do 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry 
to remain competitive  we must constantly analyze consumer preferences and competitors offerings and prices to ensure we offer a selection of convenience products and services at competitive prices to meet consumer demand 
we must also maintain and upgrade our customer service levels  facilities and locations to remain competitive and drive customer traffic to our stores 
principal competitive factors include  among others  location  ease of access  fuel brands  pricing  product and service selections  customer service  store appearance  cleanliness and safety 
in a number of our markets  our competitors that sell ethanol blended fuel may have a competitive advantage over us because  in certain regions of the country  the wholesale cost of ethanol blended fuel may  at times  be less than pure fuel 
competitive pressures could mate rially impact our fuel and merchandise volume  sales and gross profit and overall customer traffic  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
volatility in crude oil and wholesale petroleum costs could impact our operating results 
over the past three fiscal years  our fuel revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues and our fuel gross profit accounted for approximately of total gross profit 
crude oil and domestic wholesale petroleum markets are volatile 
general political conditions  acts of war or terrorism  instability in oil producing regions  particularly in the middle east and south america  and the value of the us dollar could significantly impact crude oil supplies and wholesale petroleum costs 
in addition  the supply of fuel and our wholesale purchase costs could be adversely impacted in the event of a shortage  which could result from  among other things  lack of capacity at united states oil refineries  sustained increase in global demand  or the fact that our fuel contracts do not guarantee an uninterrupted  unlimited supply of fuel 
significant increases and volatility in wholesale petroleum costs have resulted  and could in the future result  in significant increases in the retail price of petroleum products and in lower fuel gross margin per gallon 
during fiscal and fiscal  increases in the retail price of petroleum products impacted consumer demand for fuel  and we expect that future increases would have the same effect 
this volatility makes it extremely difficult to predict the impact future wholesale cost fluctuations will have on our operating results and financial condition 
dramatic increases in crude oil prices squeeze retail fuel margin because fuel costs typically increase faster than retailers are able to pass them along to customers 
a significant change in any of these factors could materially impact our fuel and merchandise volume  fuel gross profit and overall customer traffic  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in credit card expenses could tighten profit margin  especially on fuel 
a significant portion of our fuel sales involve payment using credit cards 
we are assessed credit card fees as a percentage of transaction amounts and not as a fixed dollar amount or percentage of our margins 
higher fuel prices trigger higher credit card expenses  and an increase in credit card use or an increase in credit card fees would have a similar effect 
therefore  credit card fees charged on fuel purchases that are more expensive as a result of higher fuel prices are not necessarily accompanied by higher profit margins 
in fact  such fees may cause lower profit margins 
lower profit margins on fuel sales caused by higher credit card fees may decrease our overall profit margin and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operat ions 
changes in economic conditions  consumer behavior  travel and tourism could impact our business 
in the convenience store industry  customer traffic is generally driven by consumer preferences and spending trends  growth rates for automobile and commercial truck traffic and trends in travel  tourism and weather 
changes in economic conditions generally  or in the southeastern united states specifically  could adversely impact consumer spending patterns and travel and tourism in our markets 
in particular  weakening economic conditions may result in decreases in miles driven and discretionary consumer spending and travel  which impact spending on fuel and convenience items 
in addition  changes in the types of products and services demanded by consumers may adversely affect our merchandise sales and gross profit 
similarly  advanced technology and increased use of green automobiles ie  those automobiles that do not use petroleum based fuel or that run on hybrid fuel sources could drive down demand for fuel 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and preferences while continuing to sell products and services that will positively impact overall merchandise gross profit 
approximately of our stores are located in coastal resort or tourist destinations 
historically  travel and consumer behavior in such markets is more severely impacted by weak economic conditions  such as those currently impacting the united states 
if the number of visitors to coastal resort or tourist locations decreases due to economic conditions  changes in consumer preferences  changes in discretionary consumer spending or otherwise  our sales could decline  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
market turmoil and uncertain economic conditions  including increases in food and fuel prices  changes in the credit and housing markets leading to the financial and credit crisis  actual and potential job losses among many sectors of the economy  significant declines in the stock market resulting in large losses in consumer retirement and investment accounts and uncertainty regarding future federal tax and economic policies have resulted in reduced consumer confidence  curtailed retail spending and decreases in miles driven 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence 
during fiscal and fiscal  we have experienced periodic per store sales declines in both fuel and merchandise as a result of these economic conditions 
if these econo mic conditions persist or deteriorate further  we may continue to experience sales declines in both fuel and merchandise  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
legal  technological  political and scientific developments regarding climate change may decrease demand for fuel 
developments regarding climate change and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change and the environment may decrease the demand for our major product  petroleum based fuel 
attitudes toward our product and its relationship to the environment and the green movement may significantly affect our sales and ability to market our product 
new technologies developed to steer the public toward non fuel dependant means of transportation may create an environment with negative attitudes toward fuel  thus affecting the public s attitude toward our major product and potentially having a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  new technologies developed to improve fuel efficiency or governmental mandates to improve fuel effici ency may result in decreased demand for petroleum based fuel  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
wholesale cost increases of  tax increases on  and campaigns to discourage tobacco products could adversely impact our operating results 
sales of tobacco products accounted for approximately of total revenues over the past three fiscal years  and our tobacco gross profit accounted for approximately of total gross profit for the same period 
significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products  as well as national and local campaigns to discourage the use of tobacco products  may have an adverse effect on demand for cigarettes and other tobacco products 
although the states in which we operate have historically imposed relatively low taxes on tobacco products  each year one or more of these states consider increasing the tax rate for tobacco products  either to raise revenues or deter the use of tobacco 
in fiscal  south carolina increased the tax rate for certain tobacco products  and in fiscal  four states in which we operate florida  kentucky  mississippi and north carolina each increased the tax rate for certain tobacco products 
additionally  a federal excise tax is imposed on the sale of cigarettes  and an increase of per pack in the federal excise tax on cigarettes became effective in fiscal any increase in federal or state taxes on our tobacco products could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes  cigarette unit volume and revenues  merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  major cigarette manufacturers offer substantial rebates to retailers 
we include these rebates as a component of our gross margin from sales of cigarettes 
in the event these rebates are no longer offered  or decreased  our wholesale cigarette costs will increase accordingly 
in general  we attempt to pass price increases on to our customers 
however  due to competitive pressures in our markets  we may not be able to do so 
in addition  reduced retail display allowances on cigarettes offered by cigarette manufacturers negatively impact gross margins 
these factors could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes  cigarette unit volume and revenues  merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
federal regulation of tobacco products could adversely impact our operating results 
in june  congress gave the food and drug administration fda  broad authority to regulate tobacco products through passage of the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act fsptca 
the fsptca sets national performance standards for tobacco products  requires manufacturers  with certain exceptions  to obtain fda clearance or approval for cigarette and smokeless tobacco products commercially launched  or to be launched  after february   requires new and larger warning labels on tobacco products  and requires fda approval for the use of terms such as light or low tar 
under the fsptca  the fda has passed regulations that prohibit the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to anyone under the age of years state laws are permitted to set a higher minimum age  prohibit the sale of single cigarettes or packs with less than cigarettes  prohibit the sale or distribution of non tobacco items such as hats and t shirts with tobacco brands  names or logos  prohibits the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in vending machines  self service displays  or other impersonal modes of sales  except in very limited situations  prohibits free samples of cigarettes and limits distribution of smokeless tobacco products  prohibits tobacco brand name sponsorship of any athletic  musical  or other social or cultural event  or any team or entry in those events  prohibits gifts or other items in exchange for buying cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products  and requires that audio ads use only words with no music or sound effects 
governmental actions and regulations  such as those noted above  as well as statewide smoking bans in restaurants and other public places  combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking  declines in the number of smokers in the general population and private actions to restrict smoking  have resulted in reduced industry volume  and we expect that such actions will continue to reduce consumption levels 
these governmental actions could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes  cigarette unit volume and revenues  merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our business unfavorable weather conditions  the impact of climate change or other trends or developments in the southeastern united states could adversely affect our business 
substantially all of our stores are located in the southeastern united states 
although the southeast region is generally known for its mild weather  the region is susceptible to severe storms  including hurricanes  thunderstorms  extended periods of rain  ice storms and heavy snow  all of which we have historically experienced 
inclement weather conditions as well as severe storms in the southeast region could damage our facilities  our suppliers or could have a significant impact on consumer behavior  travel and convenience store traffic patterns  as well as our ability to operate our stores 
in addition  we typically generate higher revenues and gross margins during warmer weather months in the southeast  which fall within our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
if weather conditions are not favorable during these periods  our operating results and cash flow from operations could be adversely affected 
we could also be impacted by regional occurrences in the southeastern united states such as energy shortages or increases in energy prices  fires or other natural disasters 
approximately of our stores are located in coastal resort or tourist destinations 
our coastal locations may be particularly susceptible to natural disasters or adverse localized effects of climate change  such as sea level rise and increased storm frequency or intensity 
to the extent broad environmental factors  triggered by climate change or otherwise  lead to localized physical effects  disruption in our business or unexpected relocation costs  the performance of stores in these locations could be adversely impacted 
besides these more obvious consequences of severe weather to our coastal resort stores  our ability to insure these locations  and the related cost of such insurance  may also impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many insurers already have plans in place to address the increased risks that may arise as a result of climate change  with many reducing their near term catastrophic exposure in both reinsurance and primary insurance coverage along the gulf coast and the eastern seaboard 
inability to identify  acquire and integrate new stores could adversely affect our business 
an important part of our historical growth strategy has been to acquire other convenience stores that complement our existing stores or broaden our geographic presence 
acquisitions involve risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ significantly from our expectations or the expectations of securities analysts 
for example we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional convenience stores on favorable terms 
we compete with others to acquire convenience stores 
we believe that this competition may increase and could result in decreased availability or increased prices for suitable acquisition candidates 
it may be difficult to anticipate the timing and availability of acquisition candidates 
during the acquisition process  we may fail or be unable to discover some of the liabilities of companies or businesses that we acquire 
these liabilities may result from a prior owner s noncompliance with applicable federal  state or local laws or regulations 
we may not be able to obtain the necessary financing  on favorable terms or at all  to finance any of our potential acquisitions 
we may fail to successfully integrate or manage acquired convenience stores 
acquired convenience stores may not perform as we expect or we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and financial improvements we anticipate 
we face the risk that our existing financial controls  information systems  management resources and human resources will need to grow to support future growth 
our indebtedness could negatively impact our financial health 
as of september   we had consolidated debt  including lease finance obligations  of approximately billion 
as of september   the availability under our revolving credit facility for borrowing was approximately million approximately thousand of which was available for issuance of letters of credit 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt and our leases  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  including lease finance obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness or better access to capital by  for example  limiting our ability to enter into new markets or renovate our stores  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future 
we are vulnerable to increases in interest rates because the debt under our senior credit facility is subject to a variable interest rate 
although we have entered into certain hedging instruments in an effort to manage our interest rate risk  we may not be able to continue to do so  on favorable terms or at all  in the future 
if we are unable to meet our debt obligations  we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations  seek additional equity financing or sell assets  which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  we could default on those obligations 
in addition  the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes subordinated notes contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness  which would adversely affect our financial health and could prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
despite current indebtedness levels  we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur additional debt 
this could further increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
we are able to incur additional indebtedness 
the terms of the indenture that governs our subordinated notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness under certain circumstances 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated convertible notes convertible notes  does not contain any limit on our ability to incur debt 
in addition  the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility permits us to incur additional indebtedness assuming certain financial conditions are met at the time beyond the amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
if we incur additional indebtedness  the related risks that we now face could increase 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness  including without limitation any payments required to be made to holders of our subordinated notes and our convertible notes  and to refinance our indebtedness and fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
for example  upon the occurrence of a fundamental change as such term is defined in the indenture governing our convertible notes  holders of our convertible notes have the right to require us to purchase for cash all outstanding convertible notes at of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including additional interest if any  up to but not including the date of purchase 
we also may be required to make substantial cash payments upon other conversion events related to the convertible notes 
we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain third party financing to satisfy these obligations at the time we are required to make purchases of tendered notes 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next months 
we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our revolving credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  sell assets  reduce or delay capital expenditures  seek additional equity financing or seek third party financing to satisfy such obligations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our failure to fund indebtedness obligations at any time could constitute an event of default under the instruments governing such indebtedness  which would likely trigger a cross default under our other outstandi ng debt 
if we do not comply with the covenants in the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our subordinated notes or otherwise default under them or the indenture governing our convertible notes  we may not have the funds necessary to pay all of our indebtedness that could become due 
the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our subordinated notes require us to comply with certain covenants 
in particular  our credit agreement prohibits us from incurring any additional indebtedness  except in specified circumstances  or materially amending the terms of any agreement relating to existing indebtedness without lender approval 
further  our credit agreement restricts our ability to acquire and dispose of assets  engage in mergers or reorganizations  pay dividends or make investments or capital expenditures 
other restrictive covenants require that we meet a maximum total adjusted leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio  as defined in our credit agreement 
a violation of any of these covenants could cause an event of default under our credit agreement 
if we default on the credit agreement governing our senior credit facility  the indenture governing our subordinated notes or the indenture governing our convertible notes because of a covenant breach or otherwise  all outstanding amounts could become immediately due and payable 
we cannot assure you that we would have sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts  and any acceleration of amounts due under our credit agreement or either of the indentures governing our outstanding indebtedness likely would have a material adverse effect on us 
if future circumstances indicate that goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired  there could be a requirement to write down amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and record impairment charges 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are not amortized  but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we make estimates and assumptions about sales  operating margin  growth rates  consumer spending levels  general economic conditions and the market prices for our common stock 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying these factors 
we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets prior to the annual assessment if we experience  among others  disruptions to the business  unexpected significant declines in our operating results  div estiture of a significant component of our business  changes in operating strategy or sustained market capitalization declines 
these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future 
impairment charges could substantially affect our financial results in the periods of such charges 
in addition  impairment charges could negatively impact our financial ratios and could limit our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms  or at all  in the future 
we are subject to state and federal environmental laws and other regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive governmental laws and regulations including  but not limited to  environmental regulations  employment laws and regulations  regulations governing the sale of alcohol and tobacco  minimum wage requirements  working condition requirements  public accessibility requirements  citizenship requirements and other laws and regulations 
a violation or change of these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  we may  as the owner or operator of our locations  be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at these or our former locations  whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of such contamination 
the failure to properly remediate such contamination may subject us to liability to third parties and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow money using such property as collateral 
additionally  persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at sites where they are located  whether or not such site is owned or operated by such person 
although we do not typically arrange for the tr eatment or disposal of hazardous substances  we may be deemed to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may be liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as other related costs  including governmental fines  and injuries to persons  property and natural resources 
compliance with existing and future environmental laws and regulations regulating underground storage tanks may require significant capital expenditures and increased operating and maintenance costs 
the remediation costs and other costs required to clean up or treat contaminated sites could be substantial 
we pay tank registration fees and other taxes to state trust funds established in our operating areas and maintain private insurance coverage in florida and georgia in support of future remediation obligations 
these state trust funds or other responsible third parties including insurers are expected to pay or reimburse us for remediation expenses less a deductible 
to the extent third parties do not pay for remediation as we anticipate  we will be obligated to make these payments 
these payments could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
reimbursements from state trust funds will be dependent on the maintenance and continued solvency of the various funds 
in the future  we may incur substantial expenditures for remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at existing or acquired locations 
we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at all of our current and former locations  that material environmental conditions not known to us do not exist  that future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose material environmental liability on us  or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of our locations 
in addition  failure to comply with any environmental laws  ordinances or regulations or an increase in regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply with state laws regulating the sale of alcohol and tobacco products may result in the loss of necessary licenses and the imposition of fines and penalties on us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
state laws regulate the sale of alcohol and tobacco products 
a violation or change of these laws could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations because state and local regulatory agencies have the power to approve  revoke  suspend or deny applications for  and renewals of  permits and licenses relating to the sale of these products or to seek other remedies 
such a loss or imposition could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  certain states regulate relationships  including overlapping ownership  among alcohol manufacturers  wholesalers and retailers  and may deny or revoke licensure if relationships in violation of the state laws exist 
we are not aware of any alcoholic beverage manufacturers or wholesalers having a prohibited relationship with our company 
failure to comply with the other state and federal regulations we are subject to may result in penalties or costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our business is subject to various other state and federal regulations  including  without limitation  employment laws and regulations  minimum wage requirements  overtime requirements  working condition requirements and other laws and regulations 
any appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage rate  income or overtime pay  or adoption of mandated healthcare benefits would likely result in an increase in our labor costs and such cost increase  or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums or regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  the federal minimum wage increased from per hour to per hour in fiscal further  the federal government  including the us congress  has focused extensively on health care reform legislation and has begun efforts to reform the us health care system 
a comprehensive health care reform law was recently enacted 
at this point  we are still evaluating what effect  if any  the reform may have on our business  but a requirement to provide additional health insurance benefits to our employees  or health insurance coverage to additional employees  would likely increase our costs and expenses  and such increases could be significant enough to materially impact our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding climate change and greenhouse gas ghg emissions have accelerated recently in the united states 
ghgs are certain gases  including carbon dioxide  that may be contributing to global warming and other climatic changes 
for example  in june  the us house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of acesa  which would control and reduce ghg emissions in the united states by establishing an economy wide cap and trade program 
if enacted  the acesa would impose increasing costs on the combustion of carbon based fuels such as oil and refined petroleum products 
the us senate has not passed the acesa yet and is working on other ghg reduction legislative options 
further  in december  the epa issued an endan germent finding that ghgs endanger public health and welfare and that ghg emissions from motor vehicles contribute to the threat of climate change 
although epa s endangerment finding does not itself impose any requirements  it does allow epa to proceed with  among other things  proposed rules regulating ghg emissions from motor vehicles 
the epa s endangerment finding is being challenged in federal court 
if these or other governmental climate change or ghg reduction initiatives are enacted  they could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations by increasing our regulatory compliance expenses  increasing our fuel costs and or decreasing customer demand for fuel sold at our locations 
we depend on one principal supplier for the majority of our merchandise 
a disruption in supply or a change in our relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we purchase over of our general merchandise  including most tobacco products and grocery items  from a single wholesale grocer  mclane 
we have a contract with mclane through december   but we may not be able to renew the contract when it expires  or on similar terms 
a change of merchandise suppliers  a disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with our principal merchandise suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business  cost of goods sold  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on three principal suppliers for the majority of our fuel 
a disruption in supply or a change in our relationship could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as of september   marathon  bp and citgo supplied approximately of our fuel purchases 
on july   we entered into a new fuel supply agreement with marathon 
our contract with marathon for unbranded fuel and distillate expires on december   and our contract with marathon for branded fuel and distillate expires on june   with an option for the company to renew until december  as a result of this new fuel agreement with marathon  we now have three principal suppliers for the majority of our fuel 
on september  we entered into a marketer franchise agreement  including an addendum to marketer franchise agreement  w ith citgo 
our contract with citgo expires august  and our contract with bp expires september  at this time  we cannot provide assurance that our contract with citgo will automatically renew  or that we will be able to renew our bp or marathon contracts upon expiration 
a change of suppliers  a disruption in supply or a significant change in our relationship with our principal suppliers could materially increase our cost of goods sold  which would negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
citgo obtains a significant portion of the crude oil it refines from its ultimate parent  petroleos de venezuela  sa pdvsa  which is owned and controlled by the government of venezuela 
the political and economic environment in venezuela can disrupt pdvsa s operations and adversely affect citgo s ability to obtain crude oil 
in addition  the venezuelan government can order  and in the past has ordered  pdvsa to curtail the production of oil in response to a decision by the organization of petroleum exporting countries to reduce production 
the inability of citgo to obtain crude oil in sufficient quantities would adversely affect its ability to provide fuel to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we depend on our senior management s experience and knowledge of our industry  we would be adversely affected if we were to lose any members of our senior management team 
we are dependent on the continued efforts of our senior management team 
at the end of fiscal  we hired terrance m 
marks as our new president and chief executive officer 
in addition  at the end of fiscal  frank g 
paci resigned as our chief financial officer  and we hired mark r 
bierley as our new chief financial officer 
if  for any reason  our senior executives do not continue to be active in the management of our company  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior personnel as needed in the future 
in addition  we do not maintain key personnel life insurance on our senior executives and other key employees 
we also rely on our ability to recruit qualified store and field managers 
if we fail to continue to attract these individuals at reasonable compensation levels  our operating results may be adversely affected 
pending litigation could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are party to various legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
we believe these actions are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business 
while the outcome of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty  management s present judgment is that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects 
if  however  our assessment of these actions is inaccurate  or there are any significant adverse developments in these actions  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
litigation and publicity concerning food quality  health and other related issues could result in significant liabilities or litigation costs and cause consumers to avoid our convenience stores 
convenience store businesses and other food service operators can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government agencies resulting from food quality  illness  or other health or environmental concerns or operating issues stemming from one or more locations 
lack of fresh food handling experience among our workforce increases the risk of food borne illness resulting in litigation and reputational damage 
adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us  regardless of whether the allegations are true  by discouraging customers from purchasing fuel  merchandise or food at one or more of our convenience stores 
we could also incur significant liabilities if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us 
even if we are successful in defending such litigation  our litigation costs could be significant  and the litigation may divert time and money away from our operations and adversely affect our performance 
pending sec matters could adversely affect us 
in fiscal we announced that we would restate earnings for the period from fiscal to fiscal arising from sale leaseback accounting for certain transactions 
in connection with our decision to restate  we filed a form k on july   as well as a form k a on august  restating the transactions 
the sec issued a comment letter to us in connection with the form k  and we responded to the comments 
beginning in september  we received requests from the sec that we voluntarily provide certain information to the sec staff in connection with our sale leaseback accounting  our decision to restate our financial statements with respect to sale leaseback accounting and other lease accounting matters 
in november  the sec informed us that in connection with the inquiry it had issued a formal order of private investigation 
as previously disclosed  we are cooperating with the sec in this ongoing investigation 
we are unable to predict how long this investigation will continue or whether it will result in any adverse action 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our stock 
effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our business and operating results could be harmed 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as related rules and regulations implemented by the sec  nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board  have required changes in the corporate governance practices and financial reporting standards for public companies 
these laws  rules and regulations  including compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and made many activities more time consuming and more burdensome 
these laws  rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations in many cases 
as a result  their application in practice may e volve over time as regulatory and governing bodies provide new guidance  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters 
the costs of compliance with these laws  rules and regulations have adversely affected our financial results 
moreover  we run the risk of non compliance  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations or the trading price of our stock 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement 
we have devoted significant resources to remediate our deficiencies and improve our internal control over financial reporting 
although we believe that these efforts have strengthened our internal control over financial reporting  we are continuing to work to improve our internal control over financial reporting 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
inferior internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
the dangers inherent in the storage of fuel could cause disruptions and could expose us to potentially significant losses  costs or liabilities 
we store fuel in storage tanks at our retail locations 
our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in storing fuel 
these hazards and risks include  but are not limited to  fires  explosions  spills  discharges and other releases  any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions  environmental pollution  governmentally imposed fines or clean up obligations  personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on information technology systems to manage numerous aspects of our business  and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business 
we depend on information technology systems it systems to manage numerous aspects of our business transactions and provide information to management 
our it systems are an essential component of our business and growth strategies  and a serious disruption to our it systems could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently 
these systems are vulnerable to  among other things  damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters  computer system and network failures  loss of telecommunications services  physical and electronic loss of data  security breaches  computer viruses and laws and regulations necessitating mandatory upgrades and timelines with which we may not be able to comply 
any serious disruption could cause our business and competitive position to suffer and adversely affect our operating results 
other risks future sales of additional shares into the market may depress the market price of our common stock 
if we or our existing stockholders sell shares of our common stock in the public market  including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options  or if the market perceives such sales or issuances could occur  the market price of our common stock could decline 
as of december   there were  shares of our common stock outstanding  most of which are freely tradable unless held by one of our affiliates 
pursuant to rule under the securities act of  as amended  during any three month period our affiliates can resell up to the greater of a of our aggregate outstanding common stock or b the average weekly trading volume for the four weeks prior to the sale 
sales by our existing stockholders also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate or to use equity as consideration for future acquisitions 
in addition  we have filed with the sec a registration statement that covers up to  shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options currently outstanding under our stock option plan  as well as a registration statement that covers up to million shares issuable pursuant to share based awards under our omnibus plan  plus any options issued under our stock option plan that are forfeited or cancelled after march  generally  shares registered on a registration statement may be sold freely at any time after issuance 
any issuance of shares of our common stock in the future could have a dilutive effect on your investment 
we may sell securities in the public or private equity markets if and when conditions are favorable  even if we do not have an immediate need for capital at that time 
in other circumstances  we may issue shares of our common stock pursuant to existing agreements or arrangements 
for example  upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes  we may  at our option  issue shares of our common stock 
in addition  if our convertible notes are converted in connection with a change of control  we may be required to deliver additional shares by increasing the conversion rate with respect to such notes 
notwithstanding the requirement to issue additional shares if convertible notes are converted on a change of control  the maximum conversion rate for our outstanding convertible notes is per  principal amount of convertible note s 
we have also issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock to an affiliate of merrill lynch in connection with the note hedge and warrant transactions entered into at the time of our offering of convertible notes 
raising funds by issuing securities dilutes the ownership of our existing stockholders 
additionally  certain types of equity securities that we may issue in the future could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to your rights as a holder of our common stock 
we could choose to issue additional shares for a variety of reasons including for investment or acquisitive purposes 
such issuances may have a dilutive impact on your investment 
the market price for our common stock has been and may in the future be volatile  which could cause the value of your investment to decline 
there currently is a public market for our common stock  but there is no assurance that there will always be such a market 
securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations 
this market volatility could significantly affect the market price of our common stock without regard to our operating performance 
in addition  the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the following factors among others a deviation in our results from the expectations of public market analysts and investors  statements by research analysts about our common stock  our company or our industry  changes in market valuations of companies in our industry and market evaluations of our industry generally  additions or departures of key personnel  actions taken by our competitors  sales or other issuances of common stock by us or our senior officers or other affiliates  or other general economic  political or market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
the market price of our common stock will also be impacted by our quarterly operating results and quarterly comparable store sales growth  which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
factors that may impact our quarterly results and comparable store sales include  among others  general regional and national economic conditions  competition  unexpected costs and changes in pricing  consumer trends  the number of stores we open and or close during any given period  costs of compliance with corporate governance and sarbanes oxley requirements and other factors discussed in this item a and throughout part ii

you may not be able to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you pay 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law may have the effect of preventing or hindering a change in control and adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws and applicable provisions of the delaware general corporation law may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders 
these provisions could discourage potential takeover attempts and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
these provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the issuance of up to five million shares of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt without further stockholder approval  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors  limit who may call special meetings  limit stockholder action by written consent  generally requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders  and establish advance notice requirements for any stockholder that wants to propose a matter to be acted upon by stockholders at a stockholders meeting  including the nomination of candidates for election to our board of directors 
we are also subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which limits business combination transactions with stockholders of or more of our outstanding voting stock that our board of directors has not approved 
these provisions and other similar provisions make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to acquire us without negotiation and may apply even if some of our stockholders consider the proposed transaction beneficial to them 
for example  these provisions might discourage a potential acquisition proposal or tender offer  even if the acquisition proposal or tender offer is at a premium over the then current market price for our common stock 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we may  in the future  adopt other measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an unsolicited takeover  even if such a change in control were at a premium price or favored by a majority of unaffiliated stockholders 
such measures may be adopted without vote or action by our stockholders

item properties 
as of september   we own the real property at of our stores and lease the real property at  stores 
management believes that none of these leases is individually material 
most of these leases are net leases requiring us to pay all costs related to the property  including taxes  insurance and maintenance costs 
certain of these leases are accounted for as lease finance obligations whereby the leased assets and related lease liabilities are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the aggregate rent paid in fiscal for operating leases and leases accounted for as lease finance obligations was million and million  respectively 
the following table lists the expiration dates of our leases  including renewal options lease expiration operating leases finance leases total leased total management anticipates that it will be able to negotiate acceptable extensions of the leases that expire for those locations that we intend to continue operating 
beyond payment of our contractual lease obligations through the end of the term  early termination of these leases would result in minimal  if any  penalty to us 
when appropriate  we have chosen to sell and then lease back properties 
factors leading to this decision include alternative desires for use of cash  beneficial taxation  minimization of the risks associated with owning the property especially changes in valuation due to population shifts  urbanization and or proximity to high volume streets and the economic terms of such lease finance transactions 
we own a two story   square foot office building in cary  north carolina that functions as our corporate headquarters  housing approximately employees 
we also own a three story   square foot corporate support building in sanford  north carolina  and lease our corporate annex buildings in jacksonville  florida and sanford  north carolina 
we believe that we will continue to have adequate office space for the foreseeable future

pursuant to an order entered by the joint panel on multi district litigation  all of the cases  including the seven in which we are named  have been transferred to the united states district court for the district of kansas and consolidated for all pre trial proceedings 
the plaintiffs in the lawsuits generally allege that they are retail purchasers who received less motor fuel than the defendants agreed to deliver because the defendants measured the amount of motor fuel they delivered in non temperature adjusted gallons which  at higher temperatures  contain less energy 
these cases seek  among other relief  an order requiring the defendants to install temperature adjustin g equipment on their retail motor fuel dispensing devices 
in certain of the cases  including some of the cases in which we are named  plaintiffs also have alleged that because defendants pay fuel taxes based on temperature adjusted degree gallons  but allegedly collect taxes from consumers on non temperature adjusted gallons  defendants receive a greater amount of tax from consumers than they paid on the same gallon of fuel 
the plaintiffs in these cases seek  among other relief  recovery of excess taxes paid and punitive damages 
both types of cases seek compensatory damages  injunctive relief  attorneys fees and costs  and prejudgment interest 
the defendants filed motions to dismiss all cases for failure to state a claim  which were denied by the court on february  a number of the defendants  including the company  subsequently moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or  in the alternative  for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiffs claims co nstitute non justiciable political questions 
the court denied the defendants motion to dismiss on political question grounds on december  defendants filed a request to appeal that decision to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit in june that request was denied on august  
in may  the court granted class certification to kansas fuel purchasers seeking implementation of automated temperature controls and or certain disclosures  but deferred ruling on any class for damages 
defendants sought permission to appeal that decision to the tenth circuit in june  and that request was denied on august  we continue to believe that there are substantial factual and legal defenses to the theories alleged in these lawsuits  and intend to vigorously defend against the claims 
at this stage of proceedings  we cannot estimate our ultimate exposure to loss or liability  if any  related to these lawsuits

kangaroo express and the pantry  inc no 
cv p w 
on september   a first amended complaint was filed adding enger mcconnell on behalf of herself and a putative class of similarly situated individuals 
the plaintiffs seek class action status and allege that the pantry included more information than is permitted on electronically printed credit and debit card receipts in willful violation of the fair and accurate credit transactions act  codified at usc c g 
plaintff patrick amason seeks to represent a subclass of those class members as to whom the pantry printed receipts containing the first four and last four digits of their credit and or debit card numbers 
plaintiff enger mcconnell seeks to represent a subclass of those class members as to whom the pantry printed receipts containing all digits of their credit and or debit card numbers 
the plaintiffs seeks an award of statutory damages for each alleged willful violation of the statute  as well as attorneys fees  costs  punitive damages and a permanent injunction against the alleged unlawful practice 
we believe that there are substantial factual and legal defenses to class certification and to the theories alleged in the lawsuit  and intend to vigorously defend against the claims 
as the case is at a very early stage  we cannot at this time estimate our ultimate exposure to loss or liability  if any  related to this lawsuit 
we are party to various other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
we believe these other actions are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business 
while the outcome of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty  management s present judgment is that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or prospects 
if  however  our assessment of these actions is inaccurate  or there are any significant adverse developments in these actions  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected
