item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations marketing marketing revenues  operating earnings and depreciation are as follows in thousands revenues crude oil natural gas refined products total operating earnings loss crude oil natural gas refined products total depreciation crude oil natural gas refined products total supplemental volume and price information is field level purchases per day crude oil barrels natural gas mmbtu s average purchase price crude oil per barrel natural gas per mmbtu reflects the volume purchased from third parties at the oil and natural gas field level and pipeline pooling points 
comparison to crude oil revenues declined for by percent because of significantly lower average crude oil prices as shown in the table above 
while comparative overall crude oil prices were reduced in  the direction of change in price was generally increasing during the period 
the average acquisition cost of crude oil moved from the per barrel level at the beginning of the year to per barrel for the december average price 
this event produced an inventory liquidation gain of  for the year 
the opposite event occurred in as crude oil prices declined from the per barrel range in january to the per barrel range in december causing an million inventory liquidation loss 
the company s inventory holdings result from shipments in transit and as of december  the company held  barrels of crude oil at an average price of per barrel 
excluding inventory related gains and losses  comparative operating earnings would have been  for and  for the improvement resulted from reduced prices for diesel fuel consumed in the trucking function of this business 
diesel fuel expense was million in versus million in natural gas sales are reported net of underlying natural gas purchase costs and thus reflect gross margins 
as shown above  such margins were fairly consistent between the periods 
natural gas lease purchase volumes were reduced in the current year as generally low natural gas prices caused production curtailments and delayed drilling plans by the company s supplier group 
despite reduced volumes and based on historical trends  the year should have produced significantly improved operating earnings relative to because of the volatile weather patterns that occurred as compared to the mild conditions existing in traditionally  the company captures improved unit margins during periods of rapidly changing weather 
however  the continued development of the nations natural ga s infrastructure both in terms of more diverse areas of production and expanded pipeline and storage capacity have served to reduce unit margin even during periods of severe weather 
this development may limit future opportunities to profit from natural gas marketing operations 
to counteract this dynamic  the company has begun recruiting additional producer suppliers in the expanding production areas 
contraction in the united states economy has adversely affected refined product segment revenues and operating earnings 
both and suffered from the downturn in the domestic economy which began during the third quarter of operating earnings were additionally impacted in and when the bad debt provision was increased by approximately  and  respectively  due to customer financial stability concerns 
the company has focused on cost controls and instituted personnel cut backs in the fourth quarter of in an effort to restore profitability to this segment 
comparison to crude oil revenues increased by percent in relative to due to significantly increased commodity prices during major portions of the year 
the company s monthly average crude oil acquisition price rose from the per barrel level at year end to the per barrel level in june with a subsequent steep decline beginning in august to the per barrel range by year end 
net inventory driven losses for were million 
in contrast  rising prices produced million of inventory liquidation gains in excluding the impact of inventory values as described above  crude oil operating earnings for and would have been  and  respectively 
absent the inventory items  crude oil earnings from operations were reduced in as a result of escalated prices for the diesel fuel 
diesel fuel expense was million in compared to million for natural gas operating earnings were reduced in relative to as the marketplace in provided few opportunities to enhance margins by meeting short term day to day demand needs 
in part  such conditions existed because s mild weather patterns did not stimulate localized demand spikes 
refined products revenues increased during consistent with increased commodity prices partially offset by reduced volumes as the company reduced its sales activity to less creditworthy accounts 
refined product driven operating earnings were reduced during because of an increased allowance for doubtful accounts receivable through a bad debt charge of  the company has a number of construction industry customers that experienced significantly increased fuel costs coupled with a downturn in the housing development market 
with an elevated likelihood of this class of customer experiencing financial insolvency  the company s bad debt provision was increased accordingly 
historically  prices received for crude oil  natural gas and refined products have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
see also discussion under item commodity price risk 
transportation the transportation segment revenues and operating earnings were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings depreciation represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
comparison to revenues and operating results turned downward for the transportation segment in due to reduced customer demand beginning in the third quarter of the company s customers are predominately the domestic united states petrochemical industry  and demand for such products is driven primarily by activity within the housing and automotive sectors 
the current national economic recession has severely and adversely impacted this segment of the company s business 
customer demand is down approximately and through year end showed only limited signs of recovery 
typically  as revenues decline  operating earnings decline at a faster rate  as measured by percentage  due to the fixed cost components of operating costs 
in march  the company instituted cost cutting measures including a reduction in personnel levels in order to better align costs with the company s level of revenues 
as a result  the rate of decline in operating earnings slowed relative to the rate of decline in revenues beginning in the second quarter of in addition during the third quarter of the company earned an approximate  credit against its automobile and workers compensation insurance premiums 
such premium credits served to reduce operating expenses and were a direct result of reduced activity within the transportation segment 
based on the current level of infrastructure  the company s transportation segment is designed to maximize efficiency when revenues excluding fuel adjustments are in the million per year range 
the company s transportation business tends to contract when united states and world economies weaken and also fluctuates with the exchange value for the us dollar 
a strong dollar exchange rate generally suppresses demand and reduces earnings 
other important factors include levels of competition within the tank truck industry as well as competition from the railroads 
some demand improvement  most likely the result of shifting traffic patterns from rail to truck  occurred in january and has continued to date 
comparison to transportation revenues include various component parts  the most significant being standard line haul charges  fuel adjustment charges and demurrage 
line haul revenues declined slightly during to million versus million in as the average annual demand for the company s services generally remained consistent 
fuel adjustment billings increased to million in compared to million in for comparative additional revenue of million 
however  actual fuel expense incurred increased by million during to million 
the partial inability to fully pass along fuel increases coupled with increased salary and wage cost during reduced operating earnings for the year 
oil and gas oil and gas segment revenues and operating earnings are primarily derived from crude oil and natural gas production volumes and prices 
comparative amounts for revenues  operating earnings and depreciation and depletion were as follows in thousands amount change amount change amount change revenues operating earnings loss depreciation and depletion producing property impairments represents the percentage increase decrease from the prior year 
comparative volumes and prices were as follows production volumes crude oil  bbls  bbls  bbls natural gas  mcf  mcf  mcf average price crude oil bbl bbl bbl natural gas mcf mcf mcf the revenue and earnings decline for the oil and gas segment in is attributable to decreased crude oil and natural gas prices as shown in the tables above 
depreciation and depletion expense is reduced in the current period because a significant decline in hydrocarbon prices at year end december  caused producing property impairment provisions to be recorded 
such charges reduced the level of capitalized costs for amortizing in the current period 
improved oil and gas segment revenues for in comparison to resulted from increased overall average commodity prices for both crude oil and natural gas as shown above 
crude oil volumes are reduced in and as a result of normal production declines while natural gas volumes increased for each year with favorable drilli ng results

beginning of year estimated reserve additions production reserves sold revisions of previous estimates end of year during and in total for the three year period ended december   estimated reserve additions represented percent and percent  respectively  of production volumes 
the company s current drilling and exploration efforts are primarily focused as follows east texas project beginning in  the company began acquiring acreage interests in nacogdoches and shelby counties of east texas 
subsequent drilling activity produced productive wells through the end of four of the successful wells targeted the haynesville shale play of nacogdoches county with the hill  the pop pop gas unit and the hassell gas unit each beginning initial production rates from  to in excess of  mcf per day of natural gas with flowing tubing pressures in excess of psi 
the company has a five percent working interest in these three wells and holds a five percent working interest in approximately  acres  which includes the area of the haynesville wells 
a two percent working interest is held in approximately  additional adjacent acres 
 drilling activity will continue on this project with six rigs scheduled during eaglewood project the eaglewood project encompasses a ten county area from south texas along the gulf coast and northward into east texas 
in this area  the company purchased existing d seismic data and reprocessed it using proprietary techniques 
during  five wells were successfully drilled 
in  activity was curtailed due to reduced prices for natural gas 
active efforts resumed in with one successful well drilled in the first quarter and three wells approved for drilling 
the company anticipates additional economically viable prospects will be identified for future drilling 
the company has a five percent working interest in this project 
southwestern arkansas the company participated in three d seismic surveys in southwestern arkansas covering approximately square miles 
after initially drilling two unsuccessful test wells on this project in  additional study was completed and a successful well was drilled in and is presently completing 
indications continue to suggest that multiple drillable shallow oil prospects will be identified 
the company s working interest in this project varies from percent to percent 
south central kansas the company is participating with a percent working interest in a large d seismic survey in south central kansas 
a number of prospects have been identified with the first well scheduled to spud in the first quarter of oil and gas property sale in may  the company sold its interest in certain louisiana producing oil and gas properties 
sale proceeds totaled million resulting in a pre tax gain on sale of approximately million 
general and administrative  interest income and income tax general and administrative expenses were elevated during due primarily to federally mandated sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
interest income declined in and as interest rates on overnight deposits declined to near zero following the significant turmoil that occurred in the financial markets during the fall of the provision for income taxes is based on federal and state tax rates and variations are consistent with taxable income in the respective accounting periods 
outlook recent successful results in the haynesville shale formation of east texas should boost natural gas volumes and revenues 
further for  emphasis will be on development drilling which should reduce the level of exploration expense charged to earnings 
the marketing and transportation segments are also forecasting stable profitability during absent declines in crude oil and natural gas prices  upcoming results should show improvement over the current level of earnings 
the company has the following major objectives for maintain marketing operating earnings at the million level exclusive of inventory valuation gains or losses 
establish transportation operating earnings at the million level 
establish oil and gas operating earnings at the million level and replace production with current reserve additions 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity primarily derives from net cash provided from operating activities  which was   and  for each of  and  respectively 
as of december  and  the company had no bank debt or other forms of debenture obligations 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of december   and such balances are maintained in order to meet the timing of day to day cash needs 
working capital  the excess of current assets over current liabilities  totaled  as of december  from time to time  the company may make cash prepayments to certain suppliers of crude oil and natural gas for the company s marketing operations 
such prepayments totaled  as of december  and such amounts will be recouped and advanced from month to month as the suppliers deliver product to the company 
the company also requires certain counterparties to post cash collateral with the company in order to support their purchases from the company 
such cash collateral held by the company totaled  as of december  management believes current cash balances  together with expected cash generated from future operations  will be sufficient to meet short term and long term liquidity needs 
the company utilizes cash from operations to make discretionary investments in its oil and natural gas exploration  marketing and transportation businesses  which comprise substantially all of the company s investing cash outflows for each of the past three years 
the company does not look to proceeds from property sales to fund its cash flow needs 
however  during may  the company received net proceeds of  related to the sale of oil and gas properties and such sale was made due to attractive pricing 
currently  the company does not plan to make significant dispositions of its oil and gas properties in the future  but certain oil and gas interests may be disposed of should favorable opportunities arise 
except for a total of million in operating lease commitments for transportation equipment and office lease space  the company s future commitments and planned investments can be readily curtailed if operating cash flows contract 
capital expenditures during included  for marketing and transportation equipment additions primarily trucks and trailers and  in property additions associated with oil and gas exploration and production activities 
for  the company anticipates expending approximately million on oil and gas exploration projects to be funded from operating cash flow and available working capital 
in addition  approximately million will be expended towards replacement of older truck tractors within the company s marketing and transportation businesses with funding from available cash flow 
historically  the company pays an annual dividend in the fourth quarter of each year  and the company paid a 
per common share or  dividend to shareholders of record as of december  the most significant item affecting future increases or decreases in liquidity is earnings from operations and such earnings are dependent on the success of future operations see item a risk factors in this annual report of form k 
banking relationships in august  the company entered into a credit and security agreement with wells fargo bank to provide a million letter of credit facility 
pursuant to the wells fargo agreement  the company discontinued its previous working capital lines of credit with bank of america 
the wells fargo facility provides for the issuance of up to million of letters of credit to support the company s crude oil and natural gas marketing businesses based on the eligible accounts receivable within those operations 
letters of credit outstanding totaled million as of december  the letter of credit facility places certain restrictions on the company s gulfmark energy  inc and adams resources marketing  ltd 
subsidiaries 
such restrictions included maintaining a comb ined to current ratio and maintaining positive net earnings as defined among other restrictions 
management believes the company is currently in compliance with all such covenants 
off balance sheet arrangements the company maintains certain operating lease arrangements primarily with independent truck owner operators in order to provide truck tractor equipment for the company s fleet 
any commitments with independent truck owner operators are on a month to month basis 
all operating lease commitments qualify for off balance sheet treatment 
rental expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
as of december   commitments under long term non cancelable operating leases for the next five years are payable as follows     and none thereafter 
contractual cash obligations the company has entered into certain operating leasing arrangements for tractors  trailers and office space 
the company has no capital lease obligations 
a summary of the payment periods for contractual cash obligations is as follows in thousands thereafter total lease payments in addition to its lease financing obligations  the company is also committed to purchase certain quantities of crude oil and natural gas in connection with its marketing activities 
such commodity purchase obligations are the basis for commodity sales  which generate the cash flow necessary to meet such purchase obligations 
approximate commodity purchase obligations as of december  are as follows in thousands january remaining thereafter total crude oil natural gas insurance from time to time  the marketplace for all forms of insurance enters into periods of severe cost increases 
in the past  during such cyclical periods  the company has seen costs escalate to the point where desired levels of insurance were either unavailable or unaffordable 
the company s primary insurance needs are in the areas of worker s compensation  automobile and umbrella coverage for its trucking fleet and medical insurance for employees 
during each of  and  insurance cost stabilized and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
overall insurance cost may experience renewed rate increases during since the company is generally unable to pass on such cost increases  any increase will need to be absorbed by existing operations 
competition in all phases of its operations  the company encounters strong competition from a number of entities 
many of these competitors possess financial resources substantially in excess of those of the company 
the company faces competition principally in establishing trade credit  pricing of available materials and quality of service 
in its oil and gas operation  the company also competes for the acquisition of mineral properties 
the company s marketing division competes with major oil companies and other large industrial concerns that own or control significant refining and marketing facilities 
these major oil companies may offer their products to others on more favorable terms than those available to the company 
from time to time in recent years  there h ave been supply imbalances for crude oil and natural gas in the marketplace 
this in turn has led to significant fluctuations in prices for crude oil and natural gas 
as a result  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding both the future market price for crude oil and natural gas and the available margin spread between wholesale acquisition costs and sales realization 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates fair value accounting the company enters into certain forward commodity contracts that are required to be recorded at fair value and such contracts are recorded as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized immediately in earnings unless the derivatives qualify for  and the company elects  cash flow hedge accounting 
the company had no contracts designated for hedge accounting during  and the company utilizes a market approach to valuing its commodity contracts 
on a contract by contract  forward month by forward month basis  the company obtains observable market data for valuing its contracts 
such contracts typically have durations that are less than months 
as of december   all of the company s market value measurements were based on either quoted prices in active markets level inputs or from inputs based on observable market data level inputs 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s fair value contracts give rise to market risk  which represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of a particular commitment 
the company monitors and manages its exposure to market risk to ensure compliance with the company s risk management policies 
such policies are regularly assessed to ensure their appropriateness given management s objectives  strategies and current market conditions 
trade accounts accounts receivable and accounts payable typically represent the most significant assets and liabilities of the company 
particularly within the company s energy marketing  oil and gas exploration  and production operations  there is a high degree of interdependence with and reliance upon third parties including transaction counterparties to provide adequate information for the proper recording of amounts receivable or payable 
substantially all such third parties are larger firms providing the company with the source documents for recording trade activity 
it is commonplace for these entities to retroactively adjust or correct such documents 
this typically requires the company to absorb  benefit from  or pass along such corrections to another third party 
due to the volume of and complexity of transactions and the high degree of interdependence with third parties  this is a difficult area to control and manage 
the company manages this process by participating in a monthly settlement process with each of its counterparties 
ongoing account balances are monitored monthly and the company attempts to gain the cooperation of such counterparties to reconcile outstanding balances 
the company also places great emphasis on collecting cash balances due and paying only bonafide and properly supported claims 
in addition  the company maintains and monitors its bad debt allowance 
nevertheless a degree of risk remains due to the custom and practices of the industry 
oil and gas reserve estimate the value of capitalized cost of oil and natural gas exploration and production related assets are dependent on underlying oil and natural gas reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are based on many subjective factors 
the accuracy of reserve estimates depends on the quantity and quality of geological data  production performance data and reservoir engineering data  the pricing assumptions utilized as well as the skill and judgment of petroleum engineers in interpreting such data 
the process of estimating reserves requires frequent revision of estimates usually on an annual basis as additional information becomes available 
calculations of estimated future oil and natural gas revenues are also based on estimates of the timing of oil and natural gas prod uction  and there are no assurances that the actual timing of production will conform to or approximate such estimates 
also  certain assumptions must be made with respect to pricing 
the company s estimates assume prices will remain constant from the date of the engineer s estimates  except for changes reflected under natural gas sales contracts 
there can be no assurance that actual future prices will not vary as industry conditions  governmental regulation  political conditions  economic conditions  weather conditions  market uncertainty and other factors impact the market price for oil and natural gas 
the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting  so only costs including development dry hole costs associated with producing oil and natural gas wells are capitalized 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve quantities are the basis for the rate of amortization under the company s units of production method for depreciating  depleting and amortizing of oil and natural gas properties 
estimated oil and natural gas reserve values also provide the standard for the company s periodic review of oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
contingencies from time to time as incident to its operations  the company becomes involved in various accidents  lawsuits and or disputes 
primarily as an operator of an extensive trucking fleet  the company is a party to motor vehicle accidents  worker compensation claims or other items of general liability as are typical for the industry 
in addition  the company has extensive operations that must comply with a wide variety of tax laws  environmental laws and labor laws  among others 
should an incident occur  management evaluates the claim based on its nature  the facts and circumstances and the applicability of insurance coverage 
to the extent management believes that such event may impact the financial condition of the company  management will estimat e the monetary value of the claim and make appropriate accruals or disclosure as provided in the appropriate accounting literature guidelines 
revenue recognition the company s crude oil  natural gas and refined products marketing customers are invoiced daily or monthly based on contractually agreed upon terms 
revenue is recognized in the month in which the physical product is delivered to the customer 
where required  the company also recognizes fair value or mark to market gains and losses related to its commodity activities 
a detailed discussion of the company s revenue recognition policy is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
transportation segment customers are invoiced  and the related revenue is recognized as the service is provided 
oil and natural gas revenue from the company s interests in producing wells is recognized as title and physical possession of the oil and natural gas passes to the purchaser 
recent accounting pronouncements as of september   the financial accounting standards board issued the accounting standards codification asc which became effective for the company 
the asc is now the source of authoritative us accounting and reporting standards for nongovernmental entities  in addition to guidance issued by the sec 
no changes to accounting standards or guidance resulted from the issuance of the asc 
any references to accounting guidance in current and future financial statements will be to the applicable asc sections 
in december  the securities and exchange commission released final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting to revise the existing regulation s k and regulation s x reporting requirements to align with current industry practices and technological advances 
the new disclosure requirements include provisions that permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require a company to a disclose its internal control over reserves estimation and report the independence and qualification of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserve audit  c re port oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than period end prices and d disclose the development of any proved undeveloped reserves pud s including the total quantity of pud s at year end  material changes to pud s during the year  investments and progress toward the development of pud s and an explanation of the reasons why material concentrations of pud s have remained undeveloped for five years or more after disclosure as pud s 
the accounting changes resulting from changes in definitions and pricing assumptions should be treated as a change in accounting principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate  which is to be applied prospectively 
the disclosures required by this final ruling became effective for the company s current annual report on form k for the year ended december  in january  the fasb issued fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 oil and gas reserve estimations and disclosures asu no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk includes potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk the company had no long term debt outstanding at december  and a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in the floating rate would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  commodity price risk the company s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its marketing and production of crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing spot prices applicable to oil and gas 
commodity price risk in the company s marketing operations represents the potential loss that may result from a change in the market value of an asset or a commitment 
from time to time  the company enters into forward contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on its purchases of crude oil and natural gas 
the company may also enter into price support contracts with certain customers to secure a floor price on the purchase of certain supply 
in each instance  the company locks in a separate matching price support contract with a third party in or der to minimize the risk of these financial instruments 
substantially all forward contracts fall within a six month to eighteen month term with no contracts extending longer than two years in duration 
certain forward contracts are recorded at fair value  depending on management s assessments of numerous accounting standards and positions that comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
the fair value of such contracts is reflected on the balance sheet as fair value assets and liabilities and any revaluation is recognized on a net basis in the company s results of operations 
see discussion under fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements 
historically  prices received for oil and natural gas sales have been volatile and unpredictable with price volatility expected to continue 
from january  through december  natural gas price realizations ranged from a monthly low of per mmbtu to a monthly high of per mmbtu 
crude oil prices ranged from a monthly average low of per barrel to a high of per barrel during the same period 
a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in average natural gas and crude oil prices  assuming no changes in volume levels  would have reduced earnings by approximately  and  for the comparative years ended december  and  respectively
