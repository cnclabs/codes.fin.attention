item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains certain forward looking information 
see special note regarding forward looking statements above for certain information concerning those forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading provider of end to end public transportation information technology systems and related comprehensive technology solutions in china 
our goal is to become the largest provider of transportation information products and related comprehensive technology solutions in china  as well as the largest operator and provider of real time transportation information to consumers in china 
substantially all of our operations are conducted through our vie entities that are prc domestic companies owned principally or entirely by our prc affiliates 
through our vie entities  we are involved in developing multiple applications in transportation  digital city  and land and resource filling systems based on gis technologies which are used to service the public sector 
historically  we were engaged in three business areas transportation  land and resources  and digital city 
our transportation solutions track and store a variety of traffic information for various government entities  private sectors clients and individual users 
the land and resources business enables municipal governments to assess the efficiency of land use and the management of natural resources 
the digital city sector is designed to aid the chinese government s initiative to outfit all major cities with broadband and wireless internet access 
due to the substantial market demand for transportation information products in china  we have decided to devote more energy and resources to our transportation business since late  and expected that this line of business will become a major driver of our future development 
our transportation products and solutions are targeted for transportation management authorities under the management of the ministry of communication and the general public 
industry wide factors that are relevant to our business the transportation information industry in china is in the process of rapid and continuous development 
we believe that the trend in china s transportation information industry is the continuous increase of chinese government s and public demand for advanced transportation information products and services to support more effective and efficient transportation networks in china 
one result of this trend is the growing amount of governmental spending in the sector of transportation 
we believe this trend will impact favorably on the demand for our transportation information products and services  and accordingly result in the growth in sales of our transportation products and services 
the development of transportation information products and solutions that are made in china has grown rapidly since as a leading company in the sale of transportation information products and solutions in china  our sales revenues have a high correlation to the high speed growth of the transportation information industry in china generally 
our sales compounded annual growth rate has been at approximately for the past four years and our earnings compounded annual growth rate has also been at about over the same period 
therefore  we believe that our sales over the next five years will grow in close correlation with the rapid growth of china s transportation information industry 
one main factor that management considers when estimating our future growth is the potential revenue from larger government projects in the transportation sector of the chinese government based on annual budget reports issued by relevant governmental sectors at both central and local levels 
we expect that these potential new projects will create revenues from new transportation information product sales and services 
we expect to bid on large projects in the transportation sector going forward 
the growing use of gps and location based service in china also has a material impact on our industry 
we believe that made in china transportation information products and services will have a distinct advantage over similar products and services provided in developed countries  where development costs are generally higher 
the chinese economy is developing at a rapid pace 
as a result  there is a growing consumer market that is developing in china 
we also believe that the worldwide perception of the quality level of chinese products is improving 
recent developments on february   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with saif partners iii lp  pursuant to which we sold a total of  shares of common stock  par value per share  for an aggregate purchase price of  the shares were priced at per share 
the shares were sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the sec on november  the offering and sale of the shares closed on february  on march   we and our vie entity  the group company  entered into certain equity transfer agreements the equity transfer agreements with several individual shareholders the transferors of unisits  pursuant to which the group company acquired equity interest in unisits from the transferors 
pursuant to the equity transfer agreements  the group company purchased approximately million shares of unisits from the transferors in exchange for rmb million approximately us million in cash the cash consideration  of which is payable within seven days after the effective date of the equity transfer agreements  and approximately million shares of our common stock  which are issuable within days of the effective date of the equity transfer agreements 
the equity transfer agreements contain make good provisions  under which the transferors agree to deposit a total of  shares of our common stock with an escrow agent designated by us that they will receive as partial consideration for the acquisition 
specifically  if unisits s after tax net income under chinese gaap is less than rmb million approximately us million or its after tax net income under chinese gaap is less than rmb million approximately us million  then of the shares of our common stock deposited by the transferors in escrow will be returned to us for cancellation for each applicable year 
in addition  for each applicable year as described above  we will not be required to pay the remainder of the cash consideration  which represents rmb million approximately us million  or of the total cash consideration  per year if unisits fails to meet the respective performance targets 
taxation united states china transinfo technology corp 
is subject to united states tax at a tax rate of 
no provision for income taxes in the united states has been made as china transinfo technology corp 
had no us taxable income in and bvi our wholly owned subsidiary cabowise was incorporated in the bvi 
under the current law of the bvi  cabowise is not subject to income or capital gains tax 
in addition  dividend payments are not subject to withholding tax and income taxes in bvi 
delaware  hong kong and samoa our wholly owned subsidiary intra asia entertainment corporation delaware was incorporated in delaware 
no provision for state income taxes in delaware has been made as intra asia entertainment corporation delaware had no delaware taxable income in and our wholly owned subsidiary oriental intra asia entertainment china limited hong kong was incorporated in hong kong and  under the current laws of hong kong  is not subject to income taxes 
our wholly owned subsidiary intra asia entertainment asia pacific limited samoa was incorporated in samoa and  under the current laws of samoa  is not subject to income taxes 
prc our former chinese operating subsidiaries enjoy certain special or preferential tax treatments regarding foreign enterprise income tax in accordance with the income tax law of the prc for enterprises with foreign investment and foreign enterprises and its implementing rules 
accordingly  our former chinese operating subsidiaries have been entitled to tax concessions whereby the profit for its first two financial years beginning with the first profit making year after setting off tax losses carried forward from prior years is exempt from income tax in the prc and the profit for each of the subsequent three financial years is taxed at of the prevailing tax rates set by the relevant tax authorities 
however  on march   the national people s congress of china passed the new enterprise income tax law eit law  and on november   the state council of china passed the implementing rules for the eit law implementing rules  which took effect on january  the eit law and implementing rules impose a unified eit of on all domestic invested enterprises and fies  unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions 
therefore  nearly all fies are subject to the new tax rate alongside other domestic businesses rather than benefiting from the feit  and its associated preferential tax treatments  beginning january despite these changes  the eit law gives existing fies a five year grandfather period during which they can continue to enjoy their existing preferential tax treatments 
we are expecting that the measures to implement the grandfather period will be enacted by the chinese government in the coming months and will assess what the impact of the new regulations are at that time 
the discontinuation of any such special or preferential tax treatment or other incentives would have an adverse affect on any organization s business  fiscal condition and current operations in china 
in addition to the changes to the current tax structure  under the eit law  an enterprise established outside of china with de facto management bodies within china is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an eit of on its global income 
the implementing rules define the term de facto management bodies as an establishment that exercises  in substance  overall management and control over the production  business  personnel  accounting  etc  of a chinese enterprise 
if the prc tax authorities subsequently determine that we should be classified as a resident enterprise  then the organization s global income will be subject to prc income tax of 
for the year ended december   the above tax rules did not have any material financial impact on the company because we did not have any income from outside of the prc in the group company  zhangcheng media  xinjiang zhangcheng  and dajian zhitong are subject to a tax rate of on the taxable income for prc income tax purposes under the new eit law in pku  china tranwiseway  unisits  beijing unisits  and hangzhou unisits are subject to a tax rate of on the taxable income for prc income tax purposes in beijing tian hao  beijing zhangcheng and shanghai yootu qualify as new or high technology enterprises located in high tech zones in beijing and shanghai  and are entitled to tax exemptions or preferential tax rates on the taxable income for prc income tax purposes in henan unisits are subject to a special rate of for its taxable revenue in results of operations for the year ended december   our revenues increased to million  an increase of over gross profit was up from the previous year  increasing from million to million  and operating income reached million  an increase of 
finally  the company s net income for the year increased to million from million in as these results show  the company had a successful year of significant growth in it was the second successful year of transition for the company as we evolved from a geo gis custom software producer to a comprehensive transportation information solutions provider 
as a result  transportation products and solutions have continued to comprise an increasingly larger portion of our revenue throughout the year 
for  revenue from this area accounted for  growing from in our digital city and land resources urban planning software accounted for the remainder 
in we continued to provide customized transportation related software solutions to the national government and provincial and local level governments across china 
one of our most high profile contracts was with the wuhan municipal transportation management bureau to build a comprehensive transportation management system to collect  access  process and manage real time traffic data on all major roads in wuhan 
this project was the first large scale local comprehensive transportation management system in china 
with a high degree of brand recognition and strong governmental relationships  we believe that we will continue to work closely with various governmental agencies to accommodate china s continued transportation planning needs 
our consumer targeted new real time traffic data application business was also continuously enhanced this year 
in august  we launched china s first multi city real time traffic website and mobile phone software with current coverage in major cities in china  including beijing  shanghai  chongqing  shenzhen and tianjin 
in october  our mobile software application  palmcity live traffic  was added to china telecom s surfing space appmarket 
while mobile users can currently download this application for free as the appmarket is in its initial beta phase  we expect to monetize the application once the appmarket launches commercially 
we also expect that more high end cell phone manufactures will install this application on new handsets to satisfy growing consumer demand for real time traffic data 
we also launched in august our new product  the transple  an equipment and monitoring service system  which tracks transit passengers in high density areas  such as metro stations  railway stations  and airports 
the technology utilizes multi modal sensor networks composed of several laser scanners and cameras to detect and analyze pedestrian flow quantity  density  speed  and direction 
as a result  the transple can assist government authorities to develop and expand high traffic transportation centers with optimal configurations for pedestrian flow  as well as support public safety with crowd control  emergency response  and anti terrorism activities 
our most important and strategic business development during was our expansion into intelligent transportation systems for expressways through indirect acquisition of a equity interest in unisits in september unisits is a leader in china s intelligent transportation systems industry  providing traffic engineering e m systems for expressways in china 
presently  the company has a presence in more than provinces in the country 
unisits collaborates with tsinghua university to develop an expressway weight in motion system and lighting control system  both of which have been utilized by several provinces in china 
we believe that unisits is an excellent complement to our business  allowing us to take advantage of the many synergies between our two companies 
we plan to leverage unisits established market position in the expressway market with our leadership in the urban transportation market to better penetrate markets for our products and services 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following tables set forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated  in dollars and percentage of revenues and key components of our revenue for the periods indicated in dollars 
years ended december  revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operation other income and expenses interest income interest expense subsidy income other income income before income taxes  noncontrolling interests  and equity investments income tax expenses net income before noncontrolling interests and gain on equity investments in affiliates gain on investments in affiliates due to proportional shares of the affiliates net income net income before noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests in net income of subsidiary net income controlling interests   years ended december  as a percentage of revenues revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income and expenses interest income interest expenses subsidy income other income income before income taxes  noncontrolling interests  and equity investments income tax expenses net income before noncontrolling interests and gain on equity investments in affiliates gain on investments in affiliates due to proportional shares of the affiliates net income net income before noncontrolling interests noncontrolling interests in net income of subsidiary net income controlling interests revenues 
revenues increased approximately million  or to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million in approximately of this increase is attributable to the increase in sales of our transportation products in  which had approximately increase year over year compared to such increase mainly resulted from the successful execution of the company s major business since it started shifting to the transportation business in late and the rapidly developing market opportunities in the transportation information sector in china  as well as our consolidation of the financial results of unisits since september however  our digital city and land and resource businesses in total experienced about decrease compared to the same period of because we did not actively pursue digital city and land and resource businesses during even though we believe these two businesses are still experiencing healthy development and growth in china 
in addition  we believe that the overall sales increased as a result of the growing recognition of our brand name and technology 
during  the company had been constantly offering new products and solutions to the market and was able to secure more contracts from recurring clients 
the following table illustrates the revenues from the chinese government sectors and regulated industries in which we sell our products and services for the periods indicated 
the table also provides the percentage of total revenues represented by each listed sector 
year ended percentage year ended percentage december of december of  total  total revenues revenues transportation   digital city   land and resources   other   total   as the table above indicates  the transportation and digital city sectors accounted for an aggregate of and of our sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales in land and resources accounted for and of total sales over each of periods indicated above  respectively 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million in this increase was mainly due to the increase in the costs of hardware components and hardware equipment depreciation  which was generally in line with the increase in our sales 
such increase in the costs of hardware components were also due to the consolidation of the financial results of unisits  whose business involves using more hardware components in its products than the company s legacy transportation business 
as a percentage of revenues  the cost of sales increased to during the year ended december  from in due to the fact that the business of unisits involves using more hardware components in its products and has much lower margin than the company s legacy business 
the following table illustrates in detail the items constituting our costs of goods sold 
year ended year ended december december cost item salary   hardware   software licenses   outsourcing   others   total   gross profit 
our gross profit increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december   a decrease of from in our gross profit increase was mainly attributable to the increase of sales in in general 
however  our gross profit increase underperformed our revenue increase from to by about  which was mainly due to the inclusion of the financials of unisits whose sales generally involve more hardware components and have much lower margin than the company s legacy business during selling  general and administrative expenses 
majority of our services and products are sold into the domestic chinese market through contracts commissioned by the chinese government 
various government entities and agencies either invite us to bid for a specific contract or award a contract to us on a non bid basis 
we are often invited to bid on contracts through our professional relationships and are awarded repeat business 
historically  we did not invest heavily in establishing a substantial marketing program 
we promoted our products by developing relationships through peking university  professional relationships with various agencies and municipalities and in participation in industry trade exhibitions 
our marketing expenses therefore were relatively low in comparison to our competitors who do not have a record of performance and brand recognition or well established government contacts 
starting from the first quarter of  we have enhanced our marketing efforts by organizing various industry trade exhibitions and conferences in order to further promote our corporate image and brand recognition within the transportation information industry in china 
our selling expenses including sales representative commissions  promotion fees and marketing expenses  increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in as a percentage of revenues  selling expenses decreased to for the year ended december   from in the increase of selling expenses was mainly attributable to our expanded operations and sales volume as well as the enhanced marketing activities for the year ended december  our general and administrative expenses were approximately million of total sales and approximately million of total sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of administrative expenses was mainly attributable to the increase of employees  enhanced research and development efforts as well as more professional expenses associated with being a public company 
income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million and effective tax rate of while in  we recognized an income tax expense of million and effective tax rate of 
the increase in the income tax expense mainly resulted from the income tax paid or accrued with the increased taxable net incomes in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash of approximately million and restricted cash of approximately million 
the following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statements periods presented in this report 
cash flow fiscal years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash provided by used in investing activities  net cash provided by financing activities   net cash inflow   operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in fiscal year ended december   which was an increase of approximately million from approximately million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year ended december  such increase of net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase of our sales and net profit for compared to as well as the increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on incompleted contracts  which was due to the fact that we received the payments from customers ahead of our working schedules on certain contracts 
however  we also experienced significant increase in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on incompleted contracts in compared to mainly due to the fact that our working schedules were ahead of billings based on the payment terms of certain contracts  which negatively affected our cash flows from operations 
we also experienced the increase in other receivable  which consists mainly of performance bonds that we put into escrow accounts set up by our customers for contract performance purposes 
such increases were in correlation to the increase of our sales and also negatively impacted our cash from operations 
in addition  we had increases in accounts receivable and accounts payable  which were mainly due to the increase of sales and business scale 
investing activities our main uses of cash for investing activities are payments relating to the acquisition of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in fiscal year  an increase of million from the million net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year such increase of net cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to the cash acquired from the acquisition of unisits 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was approximately million  while in the same period of we had approximately million of net cash provided by financing activities 
such change was mainly attributable to the facts that we raised million in the private placement transaction in july and the payment of dividends to original shareholders of unisits for undistributed earnings prior to the acquisition in september financing agreements on june   we entered into a short term loan agreement with beijing bank  youyi branch the bank  pursuant to which the bank has agreed to loan to us rmb million approximately million for working capital purposes 
the loan had an initial annual interest rate of  which was floating based on interest rates determined by the people s bank of china from time to time 
the interest is payable on a quarterly basis commencing september  the loan expired on june  and was renewed on june  with an initial interest rate of per annum  which is also floating based on interest rates determined by the people s bank of china from time to time 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants 
the loan may be accelerated and the bank may demand immediate payment of the principal and accrued interests upon the occurrence of an event of default which includes  among other things  a failure to make principal or interest payments  a failure to comply with other covenants and certain events of bankruptcy 
as of the date of this report  a principal amount of approximately million is outstanding 
there are no financial covenants or ratios under this short term loan agreement 
on july   we completed a private placement pursuant to which we issued and sold  shares of our common stock to saif partners iii lp as a result of this private placement we raised million in gross proceeds  which left us with approximately million in net proceeds after the deduction of offering expenses in the amount of approximately million 
on september   pku entered into a short term loan agreement with huaxia bank  zhichunlu branch the huaxia bank  pursuant to which the huaxia bank has agreed to loan to pku rmb million approximately million for working capital purposes 
the loan had an initial annual interest rate of  which was floating based on interest rates determined by the people s bank of china from time to time 
the interest is payable on a monthly basis commencing october  the loan expires on september  as of the date of this report  a principal amount of approximately million is outstanding 
there are no financial covenants or ratios under this short term loan agreement 
on february   the company issued and sold a total of  shares of common stock to saif partners iii lp for an aggregate purchase price of million 
future capital requirements we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may  however  require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
in addition  because substantially all of our revenues are generated from our indirect prc subsidiary  oriental intra asia  after it receives payments from our vie entities under various services and other arrangements  the ability of oriental intra asia to make dividends and other payments to us is subject to the prc dividend restrictions 
current prc law permits payments of dividend by oriental intra asia only out of its accumulated after tax profits  if any  determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations 
oriental intra asia is also required under prc laws and regulations to allocate at least of its annual after tax profits determined in accordance with prc gaap to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches of oriental intra asia s registered capital 
allocations to the statutory reserve fund can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans  advances or cash dividends 
as a result  if our existing cash and amount available under existing bank loans insufficient to meet our requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  debt securities or borrow additional funds from lending institutions 
we can make no assurances that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the sale of additional equity securities  including convertible debt securities  would dilute the interests of our current shareholders 
the incurrence of debt would divert cash for working capital and capital expenditures to service debt obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as required  our business operations and prospects may suffer

seasonality our results of operations are affected by seasonality and we typically see lower sales during the first half than the second half of a year 
such seasonality is mainly caused by governmental seasonal budgeting activities and behaviors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any

the company uses the cost method of accounting for investments in companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which it holds an interest of less than and over which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
for entities in which the company holds an interest of greater than or in which the company does have the ability to exercise significant influence  the company uses the equity method 
the company s investments also include privately held companies where quoted market prices are not available and as a result  the cost method  combined with other intrinsic information  is used to assess the fair value of the investment 
if the carrying value is below the fair value of an investment at the end of any period  the investment is considered for impairment 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established

this method can result in the recognition of unbilled receivables or the deferral of costs or profit on these contracts 
the company did not incur any deferred costs for the years ended december  and management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates 
revisions to the estimates at completion are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known by management 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
the provision includes estimated costs in excess of estimated revenue and any profit margin previously recognized 
any advance payments received from its customers prior to recognition of revenue is classified as a current liability as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on incompleted contracts 
for taxi media advertising revenue  the company recognizes deferred revenue when cash is received  but the revenue has not yet been earned 
the company recognizes taxi media advertising revenue ratably over the period in which the advertisement is to be published 
the company has very limited system maintenance and technology upgrade services for the systems platforms we have built for clients 
in most cases  such service revenue were secured on separate contracts basis 
such service revenues are recognized ratably over the service periods 
research and development research and development expenses include payroll  employee benefits  and other headcount related expenses associated with product development 
such costs related to product development costs are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached  which for the company s products  is generally shortly before the products are released for the commercial use 
once technological feasibility is reached  such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products 
as of december  and  research and development expenses were capitalized in the amount of  and  and were included in intangible assets in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the application of a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
during  we granted stock options as part of our key performer stock based compensation program  as well as stock options or restricted stock units to management and directors 
during  we granted both stock options as part of our key performer stock based compensation program 
the vesting of stock option grants may be based on time  performance  market conditions  or a combination of performance and market conditions 
in the future  we may grant stock awards  options  or other equity based instruments allowed by our stock based compensation plans  or a combination thereof  as part of our overall compensation strategy 
the fair values of restricted stock awards with time based vesting  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are generally based on the market price of the stock awards at the date of grant 
as permitted under asc topic  we generally use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on recent six to twelve months trailing implied volatility calculations 
these calculations are performed on exchange traded options of our common stock 
we believe that using a forward looking market driven volatility assumption will result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the assumed expected life is based on company specific historical experience 
with regard to the estimate of the expected life  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
we estimate forfeiture rates at the time awards are made based on historical and estimated future turnover rates and apply these rates in the calculation of estimated compensation cost 
the estimation of forfeiture rates includes a quarterly review of historical turnover rates and an update of the estimated forfeiture rates to be applied to employee classes for the calculation of stock based compensation 
during  forfeiture rates for the calculation of stock based compensation were estimated and applied based on three classes  non employee directors  executive management staff and other employees 
at december   our annualized estimated forfeiture rates were for non employee director awards and for both executive management staff and other employee awards 
then current estimated forfeiture rates are also applied quarterly to all outstanding stock options and non vested restricted stock awards  which may result in a revised estimate of compensation costs related to these stock based grants 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding stock based compensation 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that the company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax benefit expense results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some or all of any deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company adopted asc  income taxes overall recognition  on january   which provides criteria for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax position 
the company must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the company did not recognize any additional liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of the implementation of asc goodwill the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test as of december each year in accordance with asc subtopic  goodwill formerly sfas no 
 and updates the test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company performs the annual review for goodwill impairments 
the annual test of the potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
step one of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  step two must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of the goodwill impairment loss 
if the carrying amount is less than fair value  further testing of goodwill impairment is not performed 
step two of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of the goodwill 
under step two  determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit s identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date 
the difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment charge  if any  would be the difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and the implied fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two 
for purposes of the step one analyses  determination of reporting units fair value is typically based on the income approach  which estimates the fair value of the company s reporting units based on discounted future cash flows 
the company recorded    and  in goodwill in connection with its acquisitions see note of equity of china tranwiseway  dajian zhitong  shanghai yootu  and unisits  respectively 
as of december   the company believed no goodwill was subject to the risk of impairment 
impairment of long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment 
the company periodically evaluates long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value  a write down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value 
the assumptions used by management in determining the future cash flows are critical 
in the event these expected cash flows are not realized  future impairment losses may be recorded 
management has determined that no impairments of long lived assets currently exist 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that subject the company to credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable  which are concentrated in a small number of customers in the chinese governments 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
for the years ended december  and  bad debt expenses totaled  and  respectively 
translation adjustment the company financial statements are presented in the us dollar  which is the company s reporting currency  while its functional currency is renminbi rmb 
transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of transaction 
any differences between the initially recorded amount and the settlement amount are recorded as a gain or loss on foreign currency transaction in the consolidated statements of income 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date 
any differences are taken to profit or loss as a gain or loss on foreign currency translation in the statements of income 
in accordance with asc  foreign currency matters  the company translates the assets and liabilities into us dollar using the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated at an average rate during the reporting period 
adjustments resulting from the translation from rmb into us dollar are recorded in stockholders equity as part of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the exchange rates used for interim financial statements in accordance with asc  foreign currency matters  are as follows average rate for the year december  renminbi rmb rmb rmb united states dollar exchange rate at december  renminbi rmb rmb rmb united states dollar comprehensive income comprehensive income includes accumulated foreign currency translation gains and losses 
the company has reported the components of comprehensive income on its statements of stockholders equity 
fair value measurements effective january   the company adopted asc  fair value measurement and disclosures  for its financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period  and non financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at least annually 
the adoption of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  to the company s financial assets and liabilities and non financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at least annually did not have an impact on the company s financial results 
the following table presents information about the company s assets and liabilities that are measure at fair value on recurring basis as of december   and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques the company utilized to determine such fair value 
in general  fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices adjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices in markets that are not active  interest rates and yield curves 
fair values determined by level inputs are unobservable data points for the asset or liability  and includes situations where there is little  if any  market activity for the asset or liability financial assets at fair value as of december  significant other significant quoted prices in observable unobservable december  active markets inputs inputs description level level level cash and cash equivalents   restricted cash   long term investments   total    financial assets at fair value as of december  significant other significant quoted prices in observable unobservable december  active markets inputs inputs description level level level cash and cash equivalents   restricted cash   total   the fair values of the company s cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are determined through market  observable and corroborated sources 
the fair values of the company s long term investments are unobservable data points and include situations where there is little  if any  market activity 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for other current assets  accounts payable  accrued expenses  long term debt approximate fair value due to their short term maturities 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued asc  consolidation  which applies to all companies that prepare consolidated financial statements  except not for profit organizations  but will affect only those entities that have an outstanding noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries or that deconsolidate a subsidiary 
asc is effective for us on january  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we adopted asc on january  and the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued asc  subsequent events 
asc establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
the standard  which includes a new required disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events  is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  in april  the fasb issued three related staff positions to clarify the application of fasb asc to fair value measurements in the current economic environment  modify the recognition of other than temporary impairments of debt securities  and require companies to disclose the fair value of financial instruments in interim periods 
the final staff positions are effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  fasb asc transitional which provides guidance on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities under fasb asc in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date 
fasb asc which modifies the requirements for recognizing other than temporarily impaired debt securities and significantly changes the existing impairment model for such securities 
it also modifies the presentation of other than temporary impairment losses and increases the frequency of and expands already required disclosures about other than temporary impairment for debt and equity securities 
fasb asc which requires disclosures of the fair value of financial instruments within the scope of fasb asc in interim financial statements  adding to the current requirement to make those disclosures in annual financial statements 
the staff position also requires that companies disclose the method or methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments and a discussion of changes  if any  in the method or methods and significant assumptions during the period 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued its final statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fasb accounting standards codification and the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
established the fasb accounting standards codification asc as the single source of authoritative us gaap to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative us gaap for sec registrants 
all guidance in the asc carries an equal level of authority 
the asc supersedes all previously existing non sec accounting and reporting standards 
the asc simplifies user access to all authoritative us gaap by reorganizing previously issued us gaap pronouncements into approximately accounting topics within a consistent structure  without creating new accounting and reporting guidance 
the asc became effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september   accordingly  we adopted the asc in the third quarter of fiscal following sfas no 
 the fasb will not issue new standards in the form of statements  fasb staff positions  or emerging issues task force abstracts  instead  it will issue accounting standards updates 
the fasb will not consider accounting standards updates as authoritative in their own right  these updates will serve only to update the asc  provide background information about the guidance  and provide the bases for conclusions on the change s in the asc 
for the discussion herein  we refer to asc citations that relate to asc topics and their descriptive titles  as appropriate  and no longer refer to citations that relate to accounting pronouncements superseded by the asc 
in june  the fasb issued asc  which eliminates the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity  creates more stringent conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale  clarifies other sale accounting criteria  and changes the initial measurement of a transferor s interest in transferred financial assets 
fasb asc will be effective for transfers of financial assets in fiscal years beginning after november  and in interim periods within those fiscal years with earlier adoption prohibited 
we will adopt fasb asc on january  in september  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
the new guidance states that if vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price to separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
the accounting guidance will be applied prospectively and will become effective during the first quarter of early adoption is allowed 
the company will adopt this guidance beginning january  and the company does not expect this accounting guidance to materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance related to the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosures requirements 
more specifically  this update will require a an entity to disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of levels and fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and b information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements to be presented separately ie present the activity on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs level inputs 
this guidance clarifies existing disclosure requirements for the level of disaggregation used for classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value and requires disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements using level and level inputs 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosure are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for the disclosure requirements for related to the purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the rollforward activity of level fair value measurements 
those disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu  which provides additional guidance under the fair value measurements and disclosures topic  asc application to liabilities 
the guidance clarifies that the quoted price for the liability when traded as an asset in an active market is a level measurement  when no adjustment to the quoted price is required 
in the absence of a level quoted price measurement  an entity must use one or more valuation techniques to estimate fair value in a manner consistent with the principles in asc we do not expect adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an asu regarding accounting for own share lending arrangements in contemplation of convertible debt issuance or other financing 
this asu requires that at the date of issuance of the shares in a share lending arrangement entered into in contemplation of a convertible debt offering or other financing  the shares issued shall be measured at fair value and be recognized as an issuance cost  with an offset to additional paid in capital 
further  loaned shares are excluded from basic and diluted earnings per share unless default of the share lending arrangement occurs  at which time the loaned shares would be included in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years for arrangements outstanding as of the beginning of those fiscal years 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements topic  or asu asu amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements that are currently within the scope of accounting standards codification asc subtopic the consensus in asu provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
the present standard requires that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
in addition  if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company does not believe this standard will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued asu which amended the accounting requirements under the software topic  asc revenue recognition 
the objective of this update is to address the accounting for revenue arrangements that contain tangible products and software 
specifically  products that contain software that is more than incidental to the product as a whole will be removed from the scope of asc subtopic the amendments align the accounting for these revenue transaction types with the amendments under asu mentioned above 
the guidance provided within asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and allows for either prospective or retrospective application  with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued an asu regarding accounting for own share lending arrangements in contemplation of convertible debt issuance or other financing 
this asu requires that at the date of issuance of the shares in a share lending arrangement entered into in contemplation of a convertible debt offering or other financing  the shares issued shall be measured at fair value and be recognized as an issuance cost  with an offset to additional paid in capital 
further  loaned shares are excluded from basic and diluted earnings per share unless default of the share lending arrangement occurs  at which time the loaned shares would be included in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years for arrangements outstanding as of the beginning of those fiscal years 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
