overview neuralstem is focused on the development and commercialization of treatments based on transplanting human neural stem cells 
we have developed and maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the proprietary base for our research and development efforts in the area of neural stem cell research 
we own or exclusively license four issued patents and twelve patent pending applications in the field of regenerative medicine and related technologies 
we believe our technology base  in combination with our know how  and collaborative projects with major research institutions provides a competitive advantage and will facilitate the successful development and commercialization of products for use in the treatment of a wide array of neurodegenerative conditions and in regenerative repair of acute disease 
regenerative medicine is a young and emerging field 
there can be no assurances that our intellectual property portfolio will ultimately produce viable commercialized products and processes 
even if we are able to produce a commercially viable product  there are strong competitors in this field and our product may not be able to successfully compete against them 
all of our research efforts to date are at the pre clinical or clinical stage of development 
we are focused on leveraging our key assets  including our intellectual property  our scientific team  our facilities and our capital  to accelerate the advancement of our stem cell technologies 
in addition  we are pursuing strategic collaborations with members of academia 
we are headquartered in rockville  maryland 
in addition to our core tissue based technology  we have begun developing a neurogenic and neuroprotective small molecule compound 
the patent covering this new class of drugs was issued june technology stem cells our technology enables the isolation and large scale expansion of human neural stem cells from all areas of the developing human brain and spinal cord  thus enabling the generation of physiologically relevant human neurons of all types 
our two issued core patents entitled i isolation  propagation  and directed differentiation of stem cells from embryonic and adult central nervous system of mammals  and ii in vitro generation of differentiated neurons from cultures of mammalian multipotential cns stem cell contain claims which cover the process of deriving the cells and the cells created from this process 
what differentiates our stem cell technology from others is that our patented processes do not require us to direct the cells towards a certain fate by adding specific growth factors 
our cells actually become the type of cell they are fated to be 
this process and the resulting cells comprise a technology platform that allows for the efficient isolation and production  in commercially reasonable quantities  of neural stem cells from the human brain and spinal cord 
to date the company has focused its efforts on applications involving spinal cord stem cells 
it has completed preclinical efficacy and safety studies on these cells sufficient to gain fda approval for human clinical trials 
the company believes it has established proof of principle for two important spinal cord applications als  or lou gehrig s disease  and ischemic spastic paraplegia a painful form of spasticity that may arise as a complication of surgery to repair aortic aneurysms 
in anticipation of phase i trials  the company has created spinal cord cell banks using gmp 
we have developed and we maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the proprietary basis for our research and development efforts in the area of neural stem cell research 
we own or exclusively license four issued patents and thirteen patent pending applications in the field of regenerative medicine and related technologies 
small molecule compounds the company has performed tests using cultured neural stem cells and in animals to validate the performance of small molecule compounds for hippocampal neurogenesis 
the company has successfully contracted for the manufacture of small batches of the compound 
it expects to contract for a production run using good manufacturing practice gmp methods which will be large enough to complete safety testing and phase i clinical trials 
in june the company received a notice of allowance from the us patent and trademark office uspto for a patent on these compounds 
patent application  entitled use of fused nicotinamides to promote neurogenesis  claims four chemical entities and any pharmaceutical composition including them 
research we have devoted substantial resources to our research programs in order to isolate and develop a series of neural stem cell banks that we believe can serve as a basis for therapeutic products 
our efforts to date have been directed at methods to identify  isolate and culture large varieties of stem cells of the human nervous system  and to develop therapies utilizing these stem cells 
this research is conducted both internally and through the use of third party laboratory consulting companies under our direct supervision 
trends outlook revenue we had no revenue for the years ended december  and our focus is now on initiating and successfully managing the clinical trial for als authorized by the fda in september of this year 
we are also pursuing pre clinical studies on other central nervous system indications in preparation for additional clinical trials 
we are not focused at this time on generating revenue 
long term  we anticipate our revenue will be derived primarily from licensing fees and sales of our cell therapy and small molecule compounds 
because we are at such an early stage in the clinical trials process for our first application  als  we are not yet able to accurately predict when we will have a product ready for commercialization 
research development expenses our research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing treatments for central nervous system diseases 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers and academic collaborators for research  testing  contract manufacturing  costs of facilities  and the preparation of regulatory applications and reports 
we focus on the development of treatment candidates with potential uses in multiple indications  and use employee and infrastructure resources across several projects 
accordingly  many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified product and we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in the future  as funding allows 
to the extent that it is practical  we will continue to outsource much of our efforts  including product manufacture  proof of principle and preclinical testing  toxicology  tumorigenicity  dosing rationale  and development of clinical protocol and ind packages 
this approach allows the company to use the best expertise available for each task and keep its spending inside available cash resources 
stem cells our top development priority is the als clinical trial at emory university in atlanta 
we estimate that the phase i trial for als will require to patients at an estimated cost of  per patient 
the per patient number includes the costs of the operation to administer our spinal cord cells  post operation treatment for the patient  emory university s charges for running the trial and third party trial monitoring and data collection 
our spending on an individual patient will be spread over the life of the trial as the majority of our costs are incurred after the patient has been operated on 
we expect trial spending to gradually increase to  per month after a number of patients have been treated 
in the strategy section we outlined a number of additional indications for which our spinal cord stem cells have potential therapeutic value 
we will work on proof of principle testing  dosing rationale  and the development of clinical protocols for the most promising indications 
we intend to submit ind applications to the fda to initiate clinical trials for the most promising treatment candidates 
the company expects to submit an ind to treat spinal cord injury in small molecule compounds we believe we have successfully demonstrated proof of principle to support advancement of our lead small molecule compound for treatment of depression 
we have completed planning for toxicology  tumorigenicity  dosing rationale  and development of the clinical protocol 
we will issue work orders to contractors for these efforts when funding is available 
if the remaining preclinical testing results are successful we will file an ind with the fda 
we hope to begin clinical trials for this indication in late or early general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses consist of the general costs  expenses and salaries for the operation and maintenance of our business 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase as we progress from pre clinical to a clinical phase 
we anticipate g a expenses related to our core business will increase at a slower rate than that of similar companies making such transition due in large part to our outsourcing model 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of the notes to financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements use of estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and  accordingly  require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  our management has estimated the expected economic life and value of our licensed technology  our net operating loss for tax purposes and our stock option and warrant expenses related to compensation to employees and directors  consultants and investment banks 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we had no revenues for the years ended december  and our revenues  to date  have been previously derived primarily from providing treated samples for gene expression data from stem cell experiments and from providing services as a subcontractor under federal grant programs 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods and services has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
intangible and long lived assets we follow fasb guidelines related to the accounting for impairment of long lived assets  which established a primary asset approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
during the period ended december  no impairment losses were recognized 
accounting for warrants we have adopted fasb guidance related to determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
this guidance applies to any freestanding financial instruments or embedded features that have the characteristics of a derivative  as defined by the fasb  and to any freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an entity s own common stock 
as a result  certain of our warrants are considered to be derivatives and must be valued using various assumptions as they are recorded as liabilities 
research and development costs research and development costs consist of expenditures for the research and development of patents and technology  which are not capitalizable and charged to operations when incurred 
our research and development costs consist mainly of payroll and payroll related expenses  research supplies and costs incurred in connection with specific research grants 
stock based compensation the company accounts for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with guidance issued by fasb 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed 
beginning in  we adopted the guidance issued by the fasb related to share based payments 
this guidance requires compensation costs related to share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
we recognized  and  in stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations revenue the company did not have revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
we do not anticipate any revenues for operating expenses operating expenses totaled  in and  in change in versus operating expenses research development general  selling administrative expense depreciation and amortization total expense research and development expenses research and development expenses totaled  in  as compared to  in the decrease of  or  from to was primarily attributable to the costs in of completing the application to the fda to move our cell based product into clinical trials and a reduction in non cash stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses g a expenses totaled  in  compared with  in the decrease of  or  from to was primarily attributable to increased litigation expenses offset by expense decreases spread over a wide range of categories  including non cash stock based compensation expense  and reflects management s ongoing efforts to manage cash consumption 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses totaled  in  compared with  in the increase of  or from to was primarily attributed to fixed asset and patent filing fee additions over the past year 
nonoperating expense income nonoperating expense income totaled  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the nonoperating income or expense is discussed below 
interest income totaled  in compared to  in the decrease of  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the comparable period in was attributable to lower cash balances and much reduced interest rates on short term savings 
interest expense was in and in the increase in as compared to was attributable to the short term financing of some insurance costs 
the company had a warrant modification expense of  in details of the transaction are in note to the financial statements 
on january  we reclassified the fair value of common stock purchase warrants  which have exercise price reset and anti liquidation features  from equity to liability classification as if these warrants were treated as a derivative liability since their date of issue 
we established a long term warrant liability of million to recognize the fair value of such warrants 
in the first quarter ended march   the fair value of these common stock purchase warrants decreased because of a decrease in the stock price  resulting in a gain for the quarter 
in the three months ended june   the fair value of these common stock purchase warrants increased to million because of an increase in the stock price 
we recognized a  non cash expense from the change in fair value of these warrants for the three months ended june  in the three months ended september   the fair value of these common stock purchase warrants increased to million due to an increase in the stock price 
we recognized a million non cash expense from the change in fair value of these warrants for the three months ended september  in the three months ended december   the fair value of these common stock purchase warrants increased to million due to an increase in the stock price 
we recognized a  non cash expense from the change in fair value of the warrants for the three months ended december  the net gain for the twelve month period ended december  is  liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the private placement of our securities  the exercise of investor warrants  and to a lesser degree from grants 
currently  our monthly cash burn rate is  we anticipate that our available cash and expected income will be sufficient to finance our current activities for at least the next months from december   although certain activities and related personnel may need to be reduced 
on december   we filed our first ind with the fda 
we estimate that we will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to finance our current operations  pre clinical and clinical work for at least months from december  we cannot assure you that public or private financing or grants will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
several factors will affect our ability to raise additional funding  including  but not limited to  the volatility of our common shares and general market conditions 
change in versus cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities total cash and cash equivalents was  at december   compared with  at december  the decrease in our cash and cash equivalents of  or  from december  to december  was do to the postponement of new financing until the first quarter of when the company raised an additional m 
net cash used in operating activities operating activities required  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  for the same period in the decrease of  in cash consumption  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to an increase of  in short term financing by vendors  employees and other service providers for the year and a reduction in spending  particularly in research of  and  in management incentive bonuses 

net cash used in investing activities in our investment activities we used  in cash in and  in cash in the increase in our cash use of  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  in as compared to  in as m of new financing activity was postponed to the first quarter of when better terms where available 
subsequent financing activities during the first quarter of  and subsequent to the date of the balance sheet included in this annual report  we completed a series of transactions resulting in us receiving gross proceeds for the exercise of our series a  b  c and d warrants of million 
on march  we had cash on hand of million 
listed below are key financing transactions entered into by us in the last two years 
also  please refer to the section of this annual report entitled recent sale of unregistered securities for a further description of the following transactions in february of  we sold a strategic purchaser  of our common stock 
on december   we sold  of common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s on june   we sold  of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional  common shares pursuant to our shelf registration statement on form s in september  we received  as a result of warrant exercises 
in october and december  we received  as a result of warrant exercises 
on december  we sold  of common stock pursuant to a private placement 
transactions subsequent to december  on january   we received  as a result of series d warrant exercises 
in february of  we exercised the call provision related to our series b warrants which resulted in  from the exercise thereof 
in march of  we received  as a result of series c warrant exercises 
in march of  we received  as a result of placement agent warrant exercises 
call of series b warrants during the first quarter of  we issued an aggregate of  series b warrants in connection with a private placement of our securities 
the series b warrants contained a call provision allowing us to redeem the warrants for 
per warrant share  upon days notice  provided the following two conditions were met a we receive approval of our ind  and b a registration statement covering the resale of the warrant shares shall be effective 
as a result  series b warrant holders exercised their respective warrants which resulted in us issuing  common shares and receiving gross proceeds in the amount of  we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows since inception 
we have not achieved profitability and may not be able to realize sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we do not expect to be profitable in the next several years  but rather expect to incur additional operating losses 
we have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain significant additional capital resources in order to sustain our product development efforts  for acquisition of technologies and intellectual property rights  for preclinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  for general and administrative expenses and other working capital requirements 
we rely on cash balances and the proceeds from the offering of our securities  exercise of outstanding warrants and grants to fund our operations 
we intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through the sale of our securities and additional research grants 
we have a shelf registration statement which was declared effective on september  and covers up to approximately  of our securities that could be available for financings 
on december  and june   we filed prospectus supplements under which we sold securities with an aggregate market value pursuant to general instruction ib of form s  of  accordingly  depending on our market capitalization and other restrictions and conditions contained in general instruction ib of form s  we may be able to sell up to an additional  pursuant to our shelf registration statement 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on our progress in our exploratory  preclinical and future clinical development programs 
funding may not be available when needed at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
lack of necessary funds may require us  among other things  to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  planned clinical trials  and or our capital expenditures or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties
