index overview our company resulted from the merger of corporate road show 
com inc  a new york corporation incorporated in november  and rexahn  corp  a maryland corporation  immediately after giving effect to our reincorporation as a delaware corporation under the name rexahn pharmaceuticals  inc in connection with that transaction  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours merged with and into rexahn  corp  with rexahn  corp remaining as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
in exchange for their shares of capital stock in rexahn  corp  the former stockholders of rexahn  corp received shares of common stock representing approximately of the company s outstanding equity after giving effect to the transaction 
further  upon the effective time of the merger  our historic business was abandoned and the business plan of rexahn  corp was adopted 
the transaction was therefore accounted for as a reverse acquisition with rexahn  corp as the accounting acquiring party and cprd as the acquired party 
in september  rexahn  corp was merged with and into the company 
our efforts and resources have been focused primarily on acquiring and developing our pharmaceutical technologies  raising capital and recruiting personnel 
we are a development stage company and have no product sales to date and we will not receive any product sales until we receive approval from the fda or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin selling our pharmaceutical candidates 
our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private financings  primarily private sales of common stock and debt securities  and collaboration agreements with our strategic investors 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires our management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our accounting policies are in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and their basis of application is consistent with that of the previous year 
our significant estimates include assumptions made in estimating the fair values of stock based compensation and our assessment relating to the impairment of intangible assets and deferred revenues 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of third party service costs under research and development agreements  salaries and related personnel costs  as well as stock compensation related to these costs  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage  that have no alternative future uses and are for unapproved product compounds are expensed as incurred 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements for cash and cash equivalents  prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of these financial instruments 

index income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement asc  income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of the assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates 
asc requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all portions of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including a company s current and past performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carryback and carryforward periods and existing contracts that will result in future profits 
income tax expense is recorded f or the amount of income tax payable or refundable for the period  increased or decreased by the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
as a result of the company s significant cumulative losses  we determined that it was appropriate to establish a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe that as a result of our losses sustained to date  any examination would result in a reduction of our net operating losses rather than a tax liability 
as such  we have not provided for additional taxes estimated under asc stock based compensation in accordance with asc stock compensation compensation costs related to share based payment transactions  including employee stock options  are to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  the company adheres to the guidance set forth within securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides the staff s views regarding the interaction between asc and certain sec rules and regulations  and provides interpretations with respect to the valuation of share based payments for public companies 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment  long lived assets to be held and used are analyzed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment 
if there are indications of impairment  the company uses future undiscounted cash flows of the related asset or asset grouping over the remaining life in measuring whether the assets are recoverable 
in the event such cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the recorded asset values  the assets are written down to their estimated fair value 
management determined that an impairment of intangible assets occurred in and wrote off the assets remaining carrying value of  concentration of credit risk sfas no 
 disclosure of information about financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and financial instruments with concentration of credit risk  requires disclosure of any significant off balance sheet risk and credit risk concentration 
the company does not have significant off balance sheet risk or credit concentration 
the company maintains cash and short term investments with major financial institutions 
from time to time the company has funds on deposit with commercial banks that exceed federally insured limits 
the balances are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation up to  at december   the company uninsured cash balances or  management does not consider this to be a significant credit risk as these banks and financial institutio ns are well known 

index recent accounting pronouncements affecting the company in may  the fasb issued guidance that is intended to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
this guidance is contained in asc topic subsequent events 
it requires the disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for that date 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  the company adopted the provisions of this guidance as of june  in january  the fasb issued asu  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu 
the standard amends asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures to require additional disclosures related to transfers between levels in the hierarchy of fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual fiscal years beginning after december  the standard does not change how fair values are measured  accordingly the standard will not have a financial impact on the company 
the fasb issues asus to amend the authoritative literature in asc 
there have been a number of asus to date that amend the original text of asc 
except for the asus listed above  those issued to date either i provide supplemental guidance  ii are technical corrections  iii are not applicable to the company or iv are not expected to have a significant impact on the company 
results of operations total revenues during  we entered into a collaborative research agreement with rexgene biotech co  ltd 
rexgene  a minority shareholder 
rexgene is engaged in the development of pharmaceutical products in asia and has agreed to assist us with the research  development and clinical trials necessary for registration of our archexin drug candidate in asia 
this agreement provides rexgene with exclusive rights to license  sublicense  make  have made  use  sell and import archexin in asia 
a one time contribution to the joint development and research of archexin of  was paid to us in in accordance with the agreement 
the amount of revenue from this contribution is being recognized as income over the term of this agreement which terminates at the later of years or the term of the patent on the licensed product 
we use years as the basis for revenue recognition and accordingly  was included in revenues in each fiscal year beginning with and the remaining  is reflected as deferred revenue on the balance sheet as of december  we adopted sab no 
 revenue recognition nonrefundable upfront fees with respect to the accounting for this transaction 
these fees are to be used in the cooperative funding of the costs of development of archexin 
comparison of the year ended december  and the year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including business development and general legal activities 

index general and administrative expenses increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to professional investment bank fees for financing activities  accounting fees  and stock options compensation expense 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development and other expenses relating to the design  development  testing  and enhancement of our drug candidates 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to expenses incurred in relation to phase ii clinical trials of archexin  serdaxin and zoraxel 
patent fees our patent fees increased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this was primarily due to increased activity and legal costs incurred to respond to existing patent applications in as compared to depreciation and amortization depreciation expense decreased  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lab equipment being depreciated based on a declining balance 
interest expense our interest expense was for fiscal and interest income in fiscal  we recorded  of interest income from the investment of our cash and cash equivalents and other short term investments  compared to  recorded in fiscal the decrease of  or  was primarily due to a lower average cash and cash equivalents balance 
research and development projects research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  costs to acquire pharmaceutical products and product rights for development and amounts paid to contract research organizations  hospitals and laboratories for the provision of services and materials for drug development and clinical trials 
costs incurred in obtaining the license rights to technology in the research and development stage and that have no alternative future uses are expensed as incurred 
our research and development programs are related to our three clinical stage lead drug candidates  archexin  serdaxin and zoraxel and pre clinical stage nano drug candidates  rx nano  rx nano and nano polymer anticancer drugs 
eac h of our lead drug candidates is in various stages of completion as described below 
as we expand our clinical studies  we will enter into additional development agreements 
significant additional expenditures will be required if we complete our clinical trials  start new trials  apply for regulatory approvals  continue development of our technologies  expand our operations and bring our products to market 
the eventual total cost of each clinical trial is dependent on a number of uncertainties such as trial design  the length of the trial  the number of clinical sites and the number of patients 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new therapeutic products is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
because the successful development of our most advanced drug candidates  archexin  serdaxin and zoraxel  is uncertain  and because rx nano  rx nano and nano polymer anticancer drugs are in early stage development  we are unabl e to estimate the costs of completing our research and development programs  the timing of bringing such programs to market and  therefore  when material cash inflows could commence from the sale of these drug candidates 
if these projects are not completed as planned  our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected and if we are unable to obtain additional financing to fund these projects  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 

index archexin in october  we announced the conclusion of the phase i clinical trial of archexin  our leading drug candidate 
the costs incurred for the phase i clinical trial was approximately  as of december   we have spent an additional  for phase ii clinical trials of archexin and we estimate that the phase iia trials for pancreatic cancer patients will be completed by the end of and will require approximately  serdaxin through december   the costs incurred for development of these compounds to date have been approximately  we currently estimate that these studies will require million through the end of also  phase ii clinical trials for the use of serdaxin in pd is under development 
we currently estimate that these studies will require million through the end of zoraxel through december   the costs incurred for development of these compounds to date have been approximately  we currently estimate that these studies will require approximately million through the end of pre clinical pipeline on june   the company entered into a securities purchase agreement with teva 
contemporaneous with the execution and delivery of this agreement  the parties executed a research and exclusive license option agreement relo pursuant to which the company is required to use  of the gross proceeds of the issuance and sale of shares to teva to fund a research and development program for the pre clinical development of rx and has included this amount in restricted cash equivalents 
the company will be eligible to receive royalties on net sales of rx worldwide 
during the fourth quarter of  research and development work began on the rx research and development program 
these compounds may be entered into phase i clinical trials in rx nano  rx nano and nano polymer anticancer drugs are in a pre clinical stage of development and the next scheduled program for each compound is a pre clinical toxicology study required prior to submission of an ind application to the fda 
through december   the costs incurred for development of these compounds to date have been approximately  the estimated cost to complete pre clinical toxicology and phase i clinical trials is estimated to be approximately  per each compound for a total of  
index the conduct of the clinical trial and toxicology studies described above are being accomplished in conjunction with third party clinical research organizations at external locations 
this business practice is typical for the pharmaceutical industry and companies like us 
as a result  the risk of completion or delay of these studies is not within our direct control and a program delay may occur due to circumstances outside our control 
a delay in any of these programs may not necessarily have a direct impact on our daily operations 
however  to the extent that a delay results in additional cost to us  a higher than expected expense may result 
we will need to raise additional money through debt and or equity offerings in order to continue to develop our drug candidates 
if we are not able to raise sufficient additional money  we will have to reduce our research and development activities 
we will first reduce research and development activities associated with our preclinical compounds 
to the extent necessary  we will then reduce our research and development activities related to some or all of our clinical drugs
