item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction throughout management s discussion and analysis md a the term  the company  refers to the consolidated entity of pathfinder bancorp  inc pathfinder bank and pathfinder statutory trust ii are wholly owned subsidiaries of pathfinder bancorp  inc  however  pathfinder statutory trust ii is not consolidated for reporting purposes see note of the consolidated financial statements 
pathfinder commercial bank  pathfinder reit  inc and whispering oaks development corp 
are wholly owned subsidiaries of pathfinder bank 
at december   pathfinder bancorp  mhc  the company s mutual holding company parent  whose activities are not included in the consolidated financial statements or the md a  held of the company s outstanding common stock and the public held of the outstanding common stock 
the company s business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable and independent community bank dedicated to providing value added products and services to our customers 
generally  the company has sought to implement this strategy by emphasizing retail deposits as its primary source of funds and maintaining a substantial part of its assets in locally originated residential first mortgage loans  loans to business enterprises operating in its markets  and in investment securities 
specifically  the company s business strategy incorporates the following elements i operating as an independent community oriented financial institution  ii maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  iii emphasizing investment in one to four family residential mortgage loans  loans to small businesses and investment securities  and iv maintaining a strong retail deposit base 
the company s net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its investments in mortgage and other loans  investment securities and other assets  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as by the amount of noninterest income  including income from fees  service charges and servicing rights  net gains and losses on sales of securities  loans and foreclosed real estate  and noninterest expense such as employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  data processing costs and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  of which these events are beyond the control of the company 
in particular  the general level of market rates tends to be highly cyclical 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the consolidated financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified page 
table of contents the allowance for loan losses  deferred income taxes  pension obligations  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment  the evaluation of investment securities for other than temporary impairment and the estimation of fair values for accounting and disclosure purposes to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments  and as such  could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated statements of condition 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses  and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in this report 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating and capital loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
to the extent that current available evidence about the future raises doubt about the likelihood of a deferred tax asset being realized  a valuation allowance is established 
the judgment about the level of future taxable income  including that which is considered capital  is inherently subjective and is reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance of  was maintained at december   as management believes it may not generate sufficient capital gains to offset its capital loss carry forward 
the company s effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to non taxable investment securities  and bank owned life insurance offset by the valuation allowance established on a portion of the capital loss carry forwards 
pension and post retirement benefit plan liabilities and expenses are based upon actuarial assumptions of future events  including fair value of plan assets  interest rates  rate of future compensation increases and the length of time the company will have to provide those benefits 
the assumptions used by management are discussed in note to the consolidated annual financial statements 
as a result of deteriorating economic conditions in the financial markets  which impacted the trading value of the company s common stock  management engaged an independent third party to test the company s goodwill for impairment as of december  utilizing a three step valuation approach  the third party performed testing 
management re evaluated the prior year testing results from the valuation and based on the prior year determination and improvements in company metrics and general economic trends  management has determined that the carrying value of goodwill was not impaired as of december  the valuation approach is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company carries all of its investments at fair value with any unrealized gains or losses reported net of deferred tax as an adjustment to shareholders equity  except for debt security impairment losses  which are charged to earnings when the loss is credit related and recognized in other comprehensive income when the loss is noncredit related and the security is not expected to be sold 
the company s ability to fully realize the value of its investments in various debt securities is dependent on the underlying creditworthiness of the issuing organization 
in evaluating the debt security portfolio for other than temporary impairment losses  management considers if we intend to sell the security  if it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  or the present value of expected cash flows is not page 
table of contents sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis 
in determining whether otti has occurred for equity securities  the company considers the applicable factors described above and the length of time the equity security s fair value has been below the carrying amount 
based on management s assessments during the year ended december   the company recorded other than temporary impairment charges of  including a  charge associated with its holdings in a senior unsecured note issued by cit group  inc after the company concluded that the liquidation of its holding at a loss was prudent and the security was sold on july  the remaining impairment charges were capital losses taken on the amf large cap equity fund in the amount of   in the amf ultra short mortgage fund   on a stock investment in the phoenix companies and  on the stock investment in alliance financial corp 
in addition to the impairment charges  the company s available for sale investment portfolio at december  includes unrealized losses of  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the unrealized losses 
management continually analyzes the portfolio to determine if further impairment has occurred that may be deemed as other than temporary 
further charges are possible depending on future economic conditions 
the estimation of fair value is significant to several of our assets  including investment securities available for sale  intangible assets and foreclosed real estate  as well as the value of loan collateral when valuing loans 
these are all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for securities available for sale are obtained from an independent third party pricing service 
where available  fair values are based on quoted prices on a nationally recognized securities exchange 
if quoted prices are not available  fair values are measured using quoted market prices for similar benchmark securities 
management made no adjustments to the fair value quotes that were provided by the pricing source 
the fair values of foreclosed real estate and the underlying collateral value of impaired loans are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
if necessary  appraisals are updated to reflect changes in market conditions

the increased provision is reflective of a growing loan portfolio that is more heavily weighted to commercial term and commercial real estate loans  which have higher inherent risk characteristics than a traditional consumer real estate portfolio 
the current level of non performing assets does not fall significantly outside of the bank s historic trend levels  however  the generally weak economic conditions nationally over the past two years  and the current strain on consumer discretionary income have caused management to carefully monitor and react to these trends by increasing the provision for loan losses  maintaining the company s strict loan underwriting standards and carefully monitoring the performance of the loan portfolio

loan servicing fees decreased  which is due to the combination of a drop in the volume of rate lock fees and the collection of non recurring one time fees during associated with various commercial loans 
the reduction in fees was offset by non recurring administrative income recorded from the company s mutual holding company parent that is not consolidated for financial statement reporting purposes 
revenue generated by service charges on deposit accounts was consistent with the prior year  but may be significantly impacted in by the implementation of new regulatory restrictions on the extended overdraft program 
these changes apply to all financial institutions participating in such programs 
the small decrease in noninterest income before gains and losses was offset by the significant change from net losses on sales and impairment of investment securities and loans in the prior year  to a net gain in the current year 
the net gain in sales and impairment of investment securities is a result of gains generated from the sales of securities through out the year  which were offset by recording other than temporary impairment charges during the fourth quarter

the company considers a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based upon the present value of future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral

the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon a monthly evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  which includes a review of the balances and composition of the loan portfolio as well as analyzing the level of delinquencies in each segment of the loan portfolio 
the company uses a general allocation method for the residential real estate and consumer loan pools based upon a methodology that uses loss factors applied to loan balances and reflects actual loss experience  delinquency trends and current economic conditions 
the company individually reviews commercial real estate and commercial loans greater than  that are not accruing interest and that are risk rated under the company s risk rating system as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss to determine if the loans require an impairment reserve 
large residential real estate loans may also be included in this individual loan review 
if impairment is noted  the company establishes a specific reserve allocation 
the specific allocation is determined based on the most recent valuation of the loan s collateral and the customer s ability to pay 
for all other commercial real estate and commercial loans  the company uses the general allocation method that establishes a reserve for each risk rating category 
the general allocation method for commercial real estate and commercial loans considers the same factors that are considered when evaluating residential real estate and consumer loan pools
