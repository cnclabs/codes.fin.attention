table of contents manufacturing and supply we make treprostinil  the active ingredient for remodulin and tyvaso  and treprostinil diethanolamine  the active ingredient for oral treprostinil  at our laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
until march  we made treprostinil at our chicago  illinois facility 
in june  the fda approved our silver spring facility for commercial manufacturing of treprostinil 
in november  we also received european regulatory approval to manufacture treprostinil in our silver spring facility 
with the transfer of our manufacturing operations to our silver spring facility  we have also changed our internal manufacturing process 
it is more cost effective for us to purchase the advanced intermediate compounds we use to manufacture treprostinil from several third party vendors 
our planned manufacturing process has been designed to give us the flexibility to produce both treprostinil diethanolamine the form of treprostinil used in our oral tablet and treprostinil used to produce remodulin and tyvaso efficiently in proportion to forecasted demand 
baxter healthcare corporation baxter manufactures remodulin for us 
the initial term of our agreement with baxter ended in october  but the agreement automatically renews for successive eighteen month terms unless earlier terminated by either party 
in april  we amended our agreement with baxter to extend it through in addition  we agreed that remodulin will be manufactured using a different set of equipment and in larger quantities than the current manufacturing process 
since baxter will make remodulin on different equipment and in a larger production batch than the current process  we are required to have the new equipment and process approved by the fda 
we are currently conducting the validation testing for the new equipment and process 
if the validation testing is successful  we anticipate filing for fda approval of the new equipment and process in the second half of baxter continues to manufacture remodulin for us according to the process currently approved by the fda 
we eventually intend to primarily manufacture remodulin and tyvaso in our new combination office and laboratory facility in silver spring  maryland 
also  although we maintain a three year inventory of remodulin and tyvaso  based on expected demand  we believe that having third parties approved to manufacture these products will mitigate some of our manufacturing risks  including the risk that we might not be able to produce sufficient quantities to meet patient demand 
we rely on catalent pharma solutions  inc formerly cardinal health  inc catalent to do the following conduct stability studies on remodulin  manufacture tyvaso  serve as a backup manufacturer for oral treprostinil  and analyze other products we develop 
we have begun manufacturing oral treprostinil tablets in our manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
the nebulizer used in our tyvaso inhalation system is manufactured by us through unither therapeutik gmbh 
while we purchase the components and manage the manufacturing process  nebu tec supplies all the labor to manufacture the nebulizers 
in  we anticipate commencing development of the f and h antibodies licensed from mskcc at our silver spring facility 
we expect that we will be able to utilize much of the equipment that we obtained for a previous project for f and h antibody development 
our telemedicine products are currently manufactured by winland electronics  inc although we believe that other manufacturers and suppliers could provide similar products  services and materials  there are few companies that could replace these manufacturers and suppliers 
a change in supplier or manufacturer could cause a delay in the manufacture  distribution and research efforts associated with our respective products or result in increased costs

table of contents competition many drug companies engage in research and development to commercialize products to treat cardiovascular and infectious diseases and cancer 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and the rest of the world  including the following flolan 
the first product approved by the fda for treating pah  flolan  also known as epoprostenol  is a prostacyclin that is delivered by intravenous infusion 
glaxo began marketing flolan in the united states in in  myogen  inc myogen acquired the marketing rights from glaxo for flolan in the united states 
in november  myogen was acquired by gilead sciences  inc gilead 
in  gilead returned the rights to flolan to glaxo 
the generic exclusivity period for flolan expired in april  generic epoprostenol 
in april  teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
teva announced that the fda approved its version of generic epoprostenol for the treatment of pah 
this is the first approved generic version of flolan 
in june  generamedix inc generamedix received fda approval for its version of epoprostenol  which is stable at room temperature 
in february  actelion announced that it had entered into an agreement with generamedix to acquire its epoprostenol product and expects to begin commercial sales of this product in the first half of  ventavis 
approved in december in the united states and in september in europe  ventavis is an inhaled prostacyclin analogue 
ventavis was initially marketed by cotherix  inc cotherix in the united states and is marketed by bayer schering pharma ag in europe as iloprost 
in january  cotherix was acquired by actelion  the manufacturer and distributor of tracleer and distributor of generamedix s epoprostenol product  tracleer 
the first oral drug to be approved for pah  tracleer is also the first drug in its class  known as endothelin receptor antagonists etras 
tracleer was approved in december in the united states and in may in europe 
tracleer is marketed worldwide by actelion  revatio 
approved in june in the united states  revatio is also an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer inc revatio contains sildenafil  the same active ingredient as viagra  and is the first pde inhibitor to be approved for pah  letairis 
approved in june in the united states  letairis is an oral therapy marketed by gilead for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer  letairis is an etra 
in april  glaxo received marketing authorization from the ema for letairis in europe where it is known as volibris  and thelin 
approved in august in the eu  thelin is an oral therapy  which was developed and initially marketed in europe by encysive pharmaceuticals inc encysive  for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer and letairis  thelin is an etra 
in june  pfizer completed its acquisition of encysive 
pfizer has stated that it plans to conduct a pivotal phase iii clinical trial to support registration of thelin in the united states and eventually seek fda approval 
due to their ease of use  oral therapies  such as adcirca  revatio and tracleer  are generally considered first line therapies for newly diagnosed nyha class ii pah patients 
inhaled therapies like tyvaso and ventavis are generally used in nyha class iii patients during the middle stages of the pah disease treatment cycle 
flolan and remodulin  more complex infusion therapies  are generally considered later stage therapies for nyha class iv patients 
the use of the available oral therapies and tyvaso  either alone or in combination  will delay the need for infusion therapy for many patients 
as a result  the success of other therapies in preventing disease progression affects our commercial operations 
furthermore  the commercialization of generic forms of other approved pah therapies may exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products 
for further discussion on this risk  see 
table of contents item a risk factors we may not compete successfully with established and newly developed drugs or products  or the companies that develop and market them 
holter and event monitoring analysis services and systems are provided by many local and regional competitors and a few national competitors 
we compete with all of these products for customers  funding  access to licenses  personnel  third party collaborators  product development and commercialization 
almost all of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  product development and marketing  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we have 
governmental regulation the research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are extensively regulated by governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda in the united states  the ema in the eu and similar regulatory authorities in other countries 
the steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  which are similar to steps required in most other countries  include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals  formulation studies and the submission to the fda of an ind for a new drug  clinical studies in healthy volunteers  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  clinical studies in patients to explore safety  efficacy and dose response characteristics  the submission of an nda to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  as well as animal studies to explore toxicity and for proof of concept 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
a day review period after the filing of each ind is generally required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans 
at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  the fda may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials until it authorizes trials under specified terms 
the ind process may be extremely costly and may substantially delay development of our products 
moreover  positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials 
clinical trials in support of an nda are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
during phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess its effects on bodily functions and safety  including side effects associated with increasing doses 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 

table of contents if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  then phase iii trials  also called pivotal studies  major studies or advanced clinical trials  are undertaken to further demonstrate clinical efficacy and to further test for safety within an expanded patient population at geographically diverse clinical study sites 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  an nda or a biologics license application is typically submitted to the fda in the united states  and an maa is typically submitted to the ema in the eu 
the regulatory authorities may request additional information before accepting an application  in which case the application must be resubmitted with the additional information 
once the application has been accepted  the regulatory authority reviews the application and responds to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by requests from regulatory authorities for additional information or clarification 
in the united states  the fda may refer the application to an advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether it should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee 
the regulatory authorities may also inspect the manufacturing facility before approving an application 
in the united states  if fda evaluations of the application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter 
a complete response letter will usually contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the application and authorization of commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
at the request of an applicant  the fda may designate a product as an orphan drug in the united states if the drug is intended to treat an orphan  or rare  disease or condition 
a disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than  people in the united states 
if an applicant obtains the first fda marketing approval for a certain orphan drug  the applicant will have a seven year exclusive right against generic versions to market the drug for the orphan indication 
the fda granted orphan designation for the active ingredient treprostinil for the treatment of pah as a continuous infusion 
however  this designation does not preclude us from seeking orphan drug designation for other formulations or routes of administration  such as oral or inhaled  of treprostinil to treat pah  or for treprostinil used to treat other orphan diseases 
in order for the fda to grant orphan drug designation for other formulations or routes of administration of treprostinil to treat pah  we must demonstrate that such new formulation or route of administration is clinically superior to the formulation or route of administration previously granted orphan designation 
the hatch waxman act provides that patent terms may be extended to compensate for some of the patent life that is lost during the fda regulatory review period for a product 
this extension period would generally be one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of an nda  plus all of the time between the submission date of an nda and its approval  subject to a maximum extension of five years 
similar patent term extensions are available under european laws 
following fda approval  we filed a patent term extension application with the united states patent and trademark office for our patent covering the method of treating pah using remodulin 
the application was approved in february with the maximum patent term extension of five years  and the patent will expire on october  outside of the united states  our ability to market our products will also be contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include some or all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
at present  foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level  although  within europe  procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one eu member state 

table of contents in the eu  marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized body or through a decentralized or a national level process 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products  high technology products and orphan products and is available at the applicant s option for other products 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member countries 
the decentralized procedure is available for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 
the decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions  changes existing procedures for national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu actions on products  suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more eu member countries  certify that the dossier is identical to that on which the first approval was based  or explain any differences and certify that identical dossiers are being submitted to all eu member countries for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each eu member country must decide whether to recognize approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
lack of objection of a given country within days automatically results in approval in that country 
following receipt of marketing authorization in an eu member country  the applicant is then required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate prescription pricing authority in that country 
commercial sales are only able to commence in a country once pricing approval has been received 
to secure european regulatory approvals for subcutaneous remodulin for pah  we used the mutual recognition process 
under the rules then applicable  centralized filing was not required and we perceived the decentralized procedure to be the most effective means for approval 
we filed our first maa in france in february review of our application was completed in as a result  remodulin was approved in member countries of the eu under the mutual recognition process described above 
we withdrew applications in spain  the united kingdom and ireland with the intent of resubmitting some or all of the applications when we filed for approval for intravenous remodulin since these countries required additional information not required by the other european countries 
to secure european regulatory approval for tyvaso  we submitted an maa to the ema via the centralized process in december regulations in europe have changed since we made our initial filing for remodulin and all therapies for orphan diseases must now use the centralized process 
in february  we withdrew our maa from consideration by the ema due to the ema s major objection related to findings of non compliance with good clinical practice gcp at two clinical sites 
the ema stated that these findings would preclude a recommendation for approval of tyvaso in the eu 
the ema had no major objections at the time of withdrawal related to the safety or efficacy of tyvaso 
to secure approval of the tyvaso inhalation system in the united states  applicable regulations require a quality system for the design  manufacture  packaging  labeling  storage  installation and servicing of devices intended for commercial distribution 
these quality system regulations require that various specifications and controls be established for devices  devices be designed under a quality system to meet these specifications  devices be manufactured under a quality system  finished devices meet these specifications  devices be correctly installed  checked and serviced  quality data be analyzed to identify and correct quality problems  and complaints be processed 
regulatory authorities may also require additional patient data to support approval for these devices 
we are also subject to inspections by regulatory agencies and ensuring that we meet all requirements during inspections 
to continue marketing our products after approval  applicable regulations require us to maintain a positive risk benefit profile  maintaining regulatory applications through periodic reports to regulatory authorities  fulfilling pharmacovigilance requirements  maintaining manufacturing facilities according to the fda s current good manufacturing practices requirements  and successfully completing regulatory 
table of contents agency inspections  among other requirements 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
our telemedicine products are manufactured at contract facilities that are regulated by the fda under different laws and regulations that apply to medical devices 
the telemedicine devices designed and sold by medicomp have received marketing clearance from the fda under section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act 
medical devices are required to be manufactured in conformance with the fda s quality system regulations 
in the united states  many independent third party payers  as well as the medicare and state medicaid programs  reimburse our commercial products 
medicare is the federal program that provides health care benefits to senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons 
medicaid is the federal program administered by the states to provide health care benefits to certain indigent persons 
the medicare contractors who administer the program provide reimbursement for our pharmaceutical commercial products at a rate generally equal to of the published average wholesale price as of october  the medicare part b payment formula for drugs infused through durable medical equipment or of average sales price the medicare part b payment formula for drugs inhaled through durable medical equipment 
the state medicaid programs also generally provide reimbursement for our commercial products  at reimbursement rates that are below the published average wholesale price and that vary from state to state 
in return for including our pharmaceutical commercial products in the medicare and medicaid programs  we have agreed to pay a rebate to state medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for those products 
we have also agreed to sell our commercial products under contracts with the veterans administration  department of defense  public health service and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated as b entities entities designated by federal programs to receive drugs at discounted prices at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors 
these programs and contracts are highly regulated and impose restrictions on our business 
failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for remodulin 
we estimate that between of remodulin and tyvaso sales in the united states are reimbursed under the medicare and medicaid programs 
employees we had employees as of january  we also maintain active independent contractor relationships with various individuals  most of whom have month to month or annual consulting agreements 
we believe our employee relations are excellent 
industry segments and geographic areas we operate two business segments pharmaceuticals and telemedicine 
we sell our products in the united states and throughout the rest of the world

the statements identified as forward looking statements may exist in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or in this annual report on form k 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from anticipated results 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risks related to our business we have a history of losses and may not maintain profitability 
we have experienced financial reporting periods in which we incurred net losses 
for example  for the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of approximately million as we incurred a fourth quarter charge to research and development of million in connection with our license of certain rights to commercialize adcirca from eli lilly and company lilly 
we also incurred a net loss of million in the quarter ended december  while we believe we formulate our annual cash based operating budgets with reasonable assumptions and targets  there may be factors that could affect our profitability and cause uneven quarterly and or annual operating results 
we rely heavily on sales of remodulin and tyvaso to produce revenues 
during the twelve months ended december   net remodulin sales accounted for approximately percent of our total revenues and tyvaso  which we commercially launched in september  accounted for approximately five percent of our revenues 
a wide variety of events  many of which are described in other risk factors below  could cause net remodulin and or tyvaso sales to decline 
for example  if regulatory approvals for remodulin were withdrawn  we would be unable to sell remodulin and our business could be jeopardized 
in the event that glaxosmithkline plc glaxo terminates its assignment agreement or pfizer  inc pfizer terminates its license agreement  we would have no further rights to utilize assigned patents or trade secrets to develop and commercialize remodulin and tyvaso 
any substantial change in the dosing pattern of patients using remodulin  due to combination therapy  side effects  deaths or any other reason  could decrease related revenues 
in addition  we rely on third parties to produce  market  distribute and sell remodulin and tyvaso 
the inability of any one of these third parties to perform these functions  or the failure of these parties to perform successfully  could negatively affect our revenues 
because we are very dependent on sales of remodulin and tyvaso  any reduction in sales of either or both of these products would cause our results of operations to suffer 

table of contents we may not compete successfully with established and newly developed drugs or products  or the companies that develop and market them 
we compete with established drug companies for  among other things  funding  licenses  expertise  personnel  clinical trial patients  and third party collaborators 
we also compete with these companies for market share 
most of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  distribution and technical resources than we do 
these competitors also have more experience in areas such as research and development  clinical trials  sales and marketing and regulatory matters than we do 
there are existing treatments that compete with our products  especially in the field of pah 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with several approved products in the united states and worldwide  including the following flolan  ventavis  tracleer  revatio  letairis  thelin and two generic epoprostenol formulations 
patients and doctors may perceive these competing products as safer  more effective  more convenient and or less expensive than our therapies 
alternatively  doctors may reduce the prescribed doses of our products if they prescribe them as combination therapy with our competitors products 
in addition  certain competing products are less invasive than remodulin and the use of these products may delay or prevent initiation of remodulin therapy 
any of these circumstances may dampen our sales growth  or cause our revenues to decline 
as a result of merger activity  actelion ltd actelion  gilead sciences  inc and pfizer presently control the majority of the approved therapies for pah in the united states 
in addition to reducing the number of competitors through merger activity  each of these companies has achieved considerable influence over prescribers through the sales and marketing of their respective therapies and through market dominance in this therapeutic area 
the future commercialization of additional forms of pah therapies could exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products and reduce our market share 
discoveries or development of new products or technologies by others may make our products obsolete or less useful 
other companies may discover or introduce new products that render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
our commercial therapies may have to compete with numerous investigational products currently in development 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy  may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
other investigational therapies for pah could be used in combination with  or as a substitute for  our therapies 
if this occurs  doctors may reduce or discontinue the use of our pharmaceutical products for their patients 
if third party payers do not reimburse our products  or if third party payers reduce or limit reimbursements for our products  our sales will suffer 
third party payers such as medicare  medicaid and private insurance companies agree to reimburse the costs of our pharmaceutical products 
accordingly  our commercial success is tied to such third party payers 
these third party payers frequently challenge the pricing of new and expensive drugs 
consequently  it may be difficult for our specialty pharmaceutical distributors or wholesalers to obtain reimbursement of our products from third party payers 
alternatively  third party payers may reduce the amount of reimbursement for our products based on changes in pricing of other therapies for pah  including generic formulations of other approved therapies 
if third party payers do not approve our products for reimbursement  or limit their amount of reimbursement  patients could opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  reimburse the cost of our commercial products 
our prostacyclin analogue products  remodulin and tyvaso  are expensive therapies 
the medicare modernization act mma requires that we negotiate a new price for our commercial products with the centers for 
table of contents medicare and medicaid services 
as a result of the staggered implementation of the mma  our products have not yet been subject to its pricing provisions  however  future reimbursements could be subject to reduction 
furthermore  to the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow any reduced medicaid and medicare coverage and payment developments  the negative impact on our business would be compounded 
further legislative developments related to health care reform at the federal and state level appear likely and such legislation could adversely impact our business 
we rely in part on third parties to perform activities that are critical to our business 
our ability to generate commercial sales or conduct clinical trials could suffer if our third party suppliers and service providers fail to perform 
frequently  we involve third parties to assist us in conducting clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approvals  and marketing and distributing our products  as we do not possess the internal capacity to perform all of these functions 
accordingly  the success of these third parties in performing their contractual obligations is critical to our operations 
furthermore  we may not locate acceptable contractors or enter into favorable agreements with them 
we manufacture treprostinil with raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds supplied by vendors 
the inability of our vendors to supply these raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds in the quantities we require could delay the manufacture of treprostinil for commercial use and for use in our clinical trials 
we rely on baxter international inc baxter to manufacture remodulin for us 
we are also evaluating alternative supply arrangements  including other third party production arrangements and the production of remodulin in our combination office and laboratory facility that we recently completed in silver spring  maryland 
in addition  we have increased our supply of remodulin to cover three years of expected demand 
if we are unable to implement these alternatives satisfactorily  we may not have sufficient inventory levels of remodulin to meet future demand 
catalent pharma solutions  llc catalent manufactures tyvaso for commercial use 
in addition  catalent conducts stability studies on remodulin and tyvaso for us and analyzes other products that we are developing 
we are producing oral treprostinil at our new manufacturing facility in research triangle park  north carolina 
our process to manufacture oral treprostinil has not been approved by the fda  therefore  we may encounter unforeseen obstacles in getting the process approved 
catalent also maintains the ability to manufacture oral treprostinil for us 
nebu tec international med products eike kern gmbh nebu tec retains many responsibilities related to the manufacture of the tyvaso inhalation system  which includes a nebulizer and related accessories 
although we manage the manufacturing process  we rely on nebu tec to provide the labor to manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system 
we rely on nebu tec to adhere to and maintain the manufacturing process in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
any regulatory compliance problems encountered by nebu tec relative to the manufacture of the tyvaso inhalation system could adversely affect the sale of tyvaso 
the nebu tec facility is the only facility currently approved for the manufacturing of the tyvaso inhalation system 
if we are unable to manufacture or supply the tyvaso inhalation system in the quantities we require or if our suppliers are unable to supply sufficient parts to manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system  it could delay  disrupt or prevent us from selling tyvaso  which could impede our business and the projected growth in our business 
we rely on accredo therapeutics  inc accredo  curascript  inc curascript  and cvs caremark caremark to market  distribute and sell remodulin and tyvaso in the united states 
these distributors are also partially responsible for negotiating reimbursements from third party payers for the cost of our therapies 
in january  we notified accredo  curascript and caremark of our intention to increase the price of remodulin for all concentrations by percent effective march  we 
table of contents also intend on increasing the price of remodulin to our international distributors in if our distributors do not recognize acceptable profit margins  they may discontinue the sale of our products 
furthermore  if our domestic and international distributors devote fewer resources to selling our products or are unsuccessful in their sales efforts  our revenues will suffer 
pursuant to certain rights we licensed from lilly in to commercialize adcirca  lilly manufactures and supplies adcirca to us  and we use lilly s pharmaceutical wholesaler network to distribute adcirca in the united states and puerto rico 
if lilly is unable to manufacture or supply adcirca or its distribution network is disrupted  it could delay  disrupt or prevent us from selling adcirca  which could impede the projected growth of our business 
although most of our current suppliers and service providers could be replaced  a change in suppliers and or service providers could interrupt the distribution of our commercial products and our other products and services  and impede the progress of our clinical trials  commercial launch plans and related revenues 
our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks we and our third party manufacturers are subject to the fda s current good manufacturing practices in the united states and similar stringent regulatory standards internationally 
although we can control compliance issues with respect to our internal synthesis and manufacturing processes  we do not have control over regulatory compliance by our third party manufacturers  even if we and our third party manufacturers were to comply with domestic and international drug manufacturing regulations  the sterility and quality of the products being manufactured could be substandard 
if this were to occur  such products would not be available for sale or use  if we have to replace a third party manufacturer or our own manufacturing operations  the fda and its international counterparts would require new testing and compliance inspections 
furthermore  a new manufacturer would have to be educated in the processes necessary to manufacture and commercially validate our products  as manufacturing our treprostinil based products is complex  we may be unable to contract with needed manufacturers on satisfactory terms or at all  and the supply of materials and components necessary to manufacture and package our commercial products and our other products may become scarce or interrupted 
disruptions to the supply of these materials could delay the manufacture and subsequent sale of such products 
any products manufactured with substituted materials or components would be subject to approval from the fda and international regulatory agencies before they could be sold 
the timing of any such regulatory approval is difficult to predict 
any of these factors could delay clinical trials or commercialization of our products  entail higher costs  and result in the inability to sell our products effectively 
our operations must comply with extensive fda and comparable international regulations 
failure to obtain approvals on a timely basis or to achieve continued compliance could delay  disrupt or prevent the commercialization of our products 
the products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory agencies and  once approved  are subject to extensive regulation by such agencies 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacture  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are also subject to extensive regulation 
any future product approvals we receive could be accompanied by significant restrictions on the use or marketing of the product 
potential products may fail to receive marketing approval on a timely basis  
table of contents or at all 
if granted  product approvals can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements eg  a failure to comply with the fda s post marketing requirement and post marketing conditions for tyvaso could result in its withdrawal from the market or upon the occurrence of adverse events subsequent to commercial introduction 
we are subject to similar oversight and regulation governing how we manufacture and sell our approved products 
discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing  regulatory  compliance  promotional or sales activities could result in regulatory restrictions on our products  including withdrawal of our products from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we could be subject to penalties that may consist of fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of our products and or criminal prosecution 
reports of side effects  such as sepsis  associated with intravenous remodulin could cause physicians and patients to avoid or discontinue use of remodulin in favor of alternative treatments 
sepsis is a serious and potentially life threatening infection of the bloodstream caused by a wide variety of bacteria 
intravenous prostacyclins are infused continuously through a catheter placed in a large vein in the patient s chest 
sepsis is an expected consequence of this type of delivery 
as a result  sepsis is included as a risk in both the remodulin and flolan package inserts 
although a discussion of the risk of sepsis is currently included on the remodulin label  and the occurrence of sepsis is familiar to physicians who prescribe intravenously administered therapies  concerns about bloodstream infections may adversely affect a physician s prescribing practice of remodulin 
if our products fail in clinical trials  we will be unable to obtain or maintain fda and international regulatory approvals and will be unable to sell those products 
to obtain regulatory approvals from the fda and international regulatory agencies such as the european medicines agency ema  we must conduct clinical trials demonstrating that our products  including any devices used to deliver them  are safe and effective 
in the past  several of our product candidates failed or were discontinued at various stages in the development process 
in addition  we may need to amend ongoing trials or the fda and or international regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional trials beyond those we planned 
such occurrences could result in significant delays and additional costs and related clinical trials may be unsuccessful 
in november  we reported that our freedom c phase iii clinical trial of oral treprostinil did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint 
because we have decided to amend the protocol for our current freedom m phase iii clinical trial and conduct a new phase iii clinical trial  freedom c  we expect delays in completing our clinical trials for oral treprostinil and do not anticipate filing a new drug application nda prior to the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for marketing varies by product  product use and country 
furthermore  we cannot predict with certainty the length of time it will take to complete necessary clinical trials or obtain regulatory approval of our future products 
our clinical trials may be discontinued  delayed  or disqualified for various reasons 
these reasons include the drug is ineffective  or physicians believe that the drug is ineffective  patients do not enroll in our studies at the rate we expect  ongoing or new clinical trials conducted by drug companies in addition to our own clinical trials may reduce the number of patients available for our trials  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  
table of contents other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients  our clinical trial sites or our contracted clinical trial administrators do not adhere to the trial s protocol  our trials do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines  we do not pass inspections by regulatory agencies  patients die during our trials because of an adverse event related to the trial drug  their disease is too advanced  or they experience medical problems unrelated to the drug being studied  drug supplies are unavailable or unsuitable for use in our studies  and the results of preclinical testing cause delays in our trials 
in addition  the fda and its international equivalents have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products 
as such  these regulatory agencies may not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy 
our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we comply with all potentially applicable federal  state and international regulations 
the development  manufacture  distribution  pricing  sales  marketing  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulations 
these regulations are subject to frequent revisions that often introduce more stringent requirements 
while we believe we have developed and instituted adequate corporate compliance programs  we cannot ensure that we will always be in compliance with these regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to a range of penalties including  but not limited to the termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  exclusion from government healthcare programs  and other sanctions or litigation 
if the licenses  assignments and alliance agreements we depend on are breached or terminated  we could lose our right to develop and sell products covered by such agreements 
our business depends upon the acquisition  assignment and license of drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others 
under our product license agreements  we receive certain rights to existing intellectual property owned by third parties subject to the terms of each license agreement 
our assignment agreements transfer all right  title and interest in and to the intellectual property to us  subject to the terms of each agreement 
in addition  we may be required to obtain licenses to other third party technologies to commercialize our early stage products 
this dependence on technology developed by others involves the following risks we may be unable to obtain future licenses or assignment agreements at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of our licenses or assignment agreements are terminated  we will lose our rights to develop and market related products  our license and assignment agreements generally provide the licensor or assignor the right to terminate these arrangements in the event we breach such agreements eg  we fail to pay royalties and other fees timely  and if a licensor or assignor fails to maintain the intellectual property licensed or assigned to us as required by most of our license and assignment agreements  we may lose our rights to develop 
table of contents and market some or all of our products 
in addition  we may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or force the licensor or assignor to do so 
certain license and assignment agreements may restrict our ability to develop related products in certain countries and or for particular diseases and may impose other restrictions on our freedom to develop and market our products 
when we license or are assigned drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by third parties  our rights are frequently limited 
for instance  our rights to market adcirca are geographically limited to the united states and puerto rico  however  we would have an opportunity to negotiate with lilly for the rights to market adcirca in other territories in the event that lilly decides not to market adcirca in a particular country 
furthermore  we cannot undertake any additional investigatory work with respect to adcirca in other indications of pulmonary hypertension without lilly s prior approval 
lilly also has authority over all regulatory activities  the right to determine the retail price for adcirca and the wholesale price at which they sell adcirca to us 
provisions in our license and assignment agreements may impose other restrictions that affect our ability to develop and market related products 
for example  glaxo retained an exclusive option and right of first refusal to negotiate a license agreement with us if we decide to license any aspect of the commercialization of remodulin and tyvaso anywhere in the world 
similarly  our amended license agreement with toray industries  inc toray includes a conditional non compete clause that grants toray the right to be our exclusive provider of beraprost mr 
moreover  we must also meet certain minimum annual sales to maintain our exclusive rights to beraprost mr 
if our or our suppliers patents or other intellectual property protections are inadequate  our revenues and profits could suffer or our competitors could force our products out of the market 
the period under which our commercial and developmental therapies are protected by our patent rights is limited 
our us patent for the method of treating pah with remodulin will expire in october it has already received the maximum five year extension 
patents covering methods of making remodulin and tyvaso in the us and the eu expire between october and october the patent for adcirca for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension will expire in and our patents for tyvaso will expire in the united states and in various countries throughout the eu in and  respectively 
upon the expiration of our patents  competitors may develop generic versions of our products and market those generic versions to compete with our products 
competitors may also seek to design around our patents prior to their expiration to develop competing products 
the scope of any patent may be insufficient to deter competitors and patent laws of international jurisdictions may not protect our rights to the same extent as the patent laws of the us furthermore  our suppliers intellectual property protection may not be adequate 
consequently  competitors may attempt to invalidate our existing patents before they expire 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and technological advances 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others  but these agreements may be ineffective in protecting our proprietary information 
to the extent third party patents cover our products or services  we  or our strategic collaborators would be required to seek licenses from the holders of these patents in order to manufacture  use  or sell our products and services 
payments under these licenses would reduce our profits from the sale of related products and services 
moreover  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to alter the design of our technology to avoid infringing a third party patent  we would be unable to market related products and services 

table of contents we may initiate litigation to enforce or defend our patents or proprietary rights  however  litigation can be time consuming and costly and may not conclude favorably 
if we are unsuccessful with respect to any future legal action in the defense of our patents and our patents are invalidated or canceled  our business could be negatively impacted 
furthermore  any licensed rights  patents or other intellectual property we possess may be challenged  invalidated  canceled  infringed or circumvented and therefore  may not provide us with any competitive advantage 
in july  vanderbilt university filed a lawsuit in the us district court for the district of delaware against icos corporation icos seeking to add three of its scientists as co inventors of the tadalafil compound and method of use patents 
lilly has since acquired icos 
the patents that were the subject of this lawsuit are the same patents licensed to us by lilly 
in january  the district court judge ruled in favor of icos lilly  declining to add any of these scientists as an inventor on either patent 
the plaintiff has appealed this ruling 
lilly believes these claims are without legal merit and expects to prevail in the appeal  however  it is not possible to determine the outcome 
an unfavorable final outcome could have a material adverse effect on our license for adcirca 
we may not maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect us against significant product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of drugs and diagnostics involve product liability risks 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance  we may not be able to maintain this insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  our insurance coverage may not be adequate for all potential claims 
if claims or losses significantly exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may be forced out of business 
our marketable investments may be subject to a loss in value and liquidity 
there has been deterioration and instability in the financial markets 
even though we believe we take a conservative approach to investing our funds  these periods of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets expose us to investment risk 
related risks could result in a significant loss of value and liquidity of our investments 
furthermore  issuers of the securities we hold could be subject to credit rating downgrades 
this could result in future impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio and our cash flows and operating results could be negatively affected 
if we need additional financing and cannot obtain it  our product development and sales efforts may be limited 
we may be required to seek additional sources of financing to meet unplanned expenditures 
unplanned expenditures could be significant and may result from necessary modifications to product development plans or product offerings in response to difficulties encountered with clinical trials 
we may also face unexpected costs in preparing products for commercial sale  or in maintaining sales levels of our currently marketed therapeutic products 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
furthermore  we may require additional financing to meet significant future obligations 
our convertible senior notes require partial cash settlement 
specifically  upon conversion we will be required to pay in cash the principal balance of approximately million or the conversion value at the settlement date  whichever is less 
the convertible senior notes will mature in october  but may be convertible prior to maturity at the election of their holders if certain criteria are met 
in addition  awards granted under our non dilutive share tracking awards plan stap entitle 
table of contents participants to receive in cash an amount equal to the appreciation in the price of our common stock  which is calculated as the positive difference between the closing price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the date of grant 
consequently  the stap may require significant future cash payments to the extent the price of our common stock continues to appreciate and the number of vested stap awards increases over time 
while we believe that our operating budgets incorporate the anticipated outlays of cash required by the stap  if we do not have sufficient funds to meet our contractual obligations under the convertible senior notes and the stap or are unable to secure alternative sources of financing  we could be in default  face litigation and or lose key employees 
improper handling of hazardous materials used in our activities could expose us to significant liabilities 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemical and hazardous substances and we are expanding these activities both in their scale and in new locations 
in addition  patients may dispose of our products using means we do not control 
such activities subject us to numerous federal  state  and local environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the management  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations can require significant costs  furthermore  we can be subject to substantial fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance 
while we believe we comply with laws and regulations governing these materials  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
furthermore  once chemical and hazardous materials leave our site  we cannot control what our hazardous waste removal contractors choose to do with these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for substantial civil damages or costs associated with the cleanup of the release of hazardous materials 
any related liability could exceed our resources and could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
we may encounter substantial difficulties managing our growth relative to product demand 
several risks are inherent in our business development plans 
achieving our goals will require continued and substantial investment in research and development  sales and marketing  and facilities 
for example  we have spent considerable resources building and seeking regulatory approvals for our laboratories and manufacturing facilities 
these facilities may be insufficient to meet future demand for our products or we may have excess capacity at these facilities if future demand falls short of our expectations  or if we do not receive regulatory approvals for the products we intend to produce at these facilities 
in addition  constructing our facilities is expensive  and our ability to recover our investment will depend on sales of the products manufactured at these facilities in sufficient volume to increase our revenues substantially 
if we experience sales growth  we may have difficulty managing inventory levels as marketing new therapies is complicated  and gauging future demand is often difficult and uncertain 
our ability to recognize the full value of our business tax credits may be limited 
as of december   we had approximately million in business tax credit carryforwards 
these tax credit carryforwards expire on various dates through the internal revenue service irs has not yet audited or reviewed these business tax credit carryforwards since we began utilizing them for the tax year 
we have conducted reviews of these tax credit carryforwards and have recognized reserves for those tax credits that we believe may be disallowed upon examination by the irs 
however  it is possible that  upon examination  the irs could reduce our business tax credit carryforwards further 
any reduction in business tax credit carryforwards will increase our tax expense and shorten the period before we are required to pay federal income taxes 

table of contents in addition  certain business tax credit carryforwards that were generated at various dates prior to december may be subject to limitations on their use pursuant to internal revenue code section section as a result of ownership changes as defined therein 
presently  we do not expect that these business tax credit carryforwards will expire unused 
if section ownership changes occur in the future  the utilization of related carryforwards may be deferred and may expire unused 
furthermore  our future operations may not generate sufficient taxable income in order to utilize our business tax credit carryforwards 
consequently  all or a portion of our business tax credit carryforwards might expire unused 
we have been named as a party to derivative lawsuits 
litigation proceedings are inherently uncertain and could result in an unfavorable outcome 
derivative lawsuits have been filed against certain of our directors and named executive officers relating to the modification of awards granted under our stap and the exchange of certain stock options granted under our amended and restated equity incentive plan 
we have been named as nominal defendant in these lawsuits 
see part i  item ii legal proceedings for a more detailed description of these proceedings 
the defense of these lawsuits and any future actions could result in significant legal fees  divert our management s attention from the operation of our business  and result in an outcome that could be costly and have an adverse effect on the structure of our compensation plans and our ability to attract and retain employees 
from time to time  we may be involved in other lawsuits and proceedings incidental to the conduct of our business 
we are not a party to any other lawsuit or proceeding that  in the opinion of our management  is likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock can be highly volatile and may decline 
the price of common stock can be highly volatile within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector 
consequently  there can be significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may not always relate to operating performance 
the table below sets forth the high and low closing prices for our common stock for the periods indicated  as adjusted for the two for one split of our common stock high low january  december  january  december  january  december  the price of our common stock could decline sharply due to the following factors  among others quarterly and annual financial and operating results  failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts  the results of our clinical trials  physician  patient  investor or public concerns regarding the efficacy and or safety of products marketed or being developed by us or by others  changes in  or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of  our therapeutic products by medicare or medicaid and changes in reimbursement policies of private health insurance companies  
table of contents announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products  interference in patent or other proprietary rights  substantial sales of our common stock by us or our existing shareholders  future issuances of common stock by us or any other activity which could be viewed as being dilutive to our shareholders  rumors among or incorrect statements by investors and or analysts concerning our company  our products  or operations  failure to maintain  or changes to  our approvals to sell our products  discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing  regulatory  compliance  promotional  marketing or sales activities that result in regulatory restrictions on our products  including withdrawal of our products from the market  failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals from the fda and international regulatory agencies  accumulation of significant short positions in our common stock by hedge funds or other investors or the significant accumulation of our common stock by hedge funds or other institutional investors with investment strategies that may lead to short term holdings  timing and outcome of additional regulatory submissions and approvals  and general market conditions 
we may fail to meet third party projections for our revenues or profits 
many independent securities analysts publish independently developed quarterly and annual projections of our revenues and profits 
such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty 
as a result  actual revenues and net income may differ from these projections  and even small variations in reported revenues and profits compared to securities analysts expectations could have a significant impact on the price of our common stock 
sales of our common stock may depress our stock price 
the price of our common stock could decline if we issue common stock to raise capital or to acquire a license or business  our shareholders transfer ownership of our common stock  or sell substantial amounts in the public market  or our investors become concerned that substantial sales of our common stock may occur 
a decrease in the price of our common stock could make it difficult for us to raise capital or fund acquisitions through the use of our stock 
the conversion of some or all of the convertible senior notes when the price of our common stock exceeds per share would dilute the ownership interests of our existing shareholders 
any sales of our common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the existence of the convertible senior notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the convertible senior notes could depress the price of our common stock 

table of contents the fundamental change purchase feature of the convertible senior notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company 
we may be required to repurchase the convertible senior notes by their holders in the event of a fundamental change  which includes a takeover of our company 
this may delay or prevent a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws  shareholder rights plan  and employment and license agreements could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that may be beneficial to our public shareholders 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation  by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities  and or the replacement or removal of current management by our shareholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes 
members of each class are elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace the majority of directors 
it may also deter the accumulation of large blocks of our common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
non competition and other restrictive covenants in most of our employment agreements will terminate upon a change in control that is not approved by our board 
we enter into certain license agreements that generally prohibit our counterparties to these agreements or their affiliates from taking necessary steps to acquire or merge with us  directly or indirectly throughout the term of these agreements  plus a specified period thereafter 
we are also party to certain license agreements that restrict our ability to assign or transfer the rights licensed to us to third parties  including parties with whom we wish to merge  or those attempting to acquire us 
these agreements often require that we obtain the prior consent of the counterparties to these agreements if we are contemplating a change in control 
if our counterparties to these agreements withhold their consent  related agreements could be terminated and we would lose related license rights 
these restrictive change in control provisions could impede or prevent mergers that could benefit our shareholders 
our existing directors and executive officers own a substantial portion of our common stock and might be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval 
our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately percent of our outstanding common stock as of december  shares beneficially owned include stock options that could be exercised by those directors and executive officers within days of december  accordingly  these shareholders as a group may be able to influence the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of our directors 
such shareholder influence could delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our shareholders 
because we do not intend to pay cash dividends  our shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
furthermore  we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the future 
as a result  the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon the future appreciation in the price of our common stock 
there can be no assurances that our common stock will provide a return to investors

item legal proceedings as previously disclosed in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september   on may   purported shareholder jeffrey benison ira filed a derivative complaint in the court of chancery for the state of delaware against those of our directors who were members of our board of directors as of december   and us as a nominal defendant 
an amended complaint  which the plaintiff filed on august  purportedly on our behalf  alleged  among other things  that the named director defendants breached their fiduciary duties of loyalty in connection with the modification of awards granted under the united therapeutics corporation share tracking awards plan stap and the exchange of certain stock options granted under our amended and restated equity incentive plan

in addition  we allocate our resources to developing products in other therapeutic platforms and to commercialization and development of telemedicine products and services  principally for the detection of cardiac arrhythmias abnormal heart rhythms 
our lead product is remodulin treprostinil injection remodulin to be administered subcutaneously or intravenously for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 
the 
table of contents united states food and drug administration fda initially approved remodulin in for subcutaneous under the skin administration 
subsequently  the fda broadened its approval of remodulin for intravenous in the vein use and for the treatment of patients who require transition from flolan  the first prostacyclin analogue approved by the fda for the treatment of pah 
in addition to the united states  remodulin is approved in many other countries  primarily for subcutaneous use 
in may  the fda approved adcirca tadalafil tablets adcirca  an oral therapy administered once daily for the treatment of pah to which we acquired certain exclusive commercialization rights from eli lilly and company lilly 
and  in july  the fda approved tyvaso treprostinil inhalation solution tyvaso  an inhaled therapy for the treatment of pah 
we launched both adcirca and tyvaso for commercial sale in the third quarter of with the introduction of these two new therapies  we are now able to offer treatments to a broader range of patients who suffer from pah 
in addition  we are continuing to develop an oral treprostinil 
revenues we derive most of our revenues from sales of remodulin 
beginning with the quarter ended september   we have also recognized revenues from our recently approved therapies  adcirca and tyvaso  and expect these sources of revenue to grow over time  as the therapies gain broader acceptance in the market 
we sell remodulin and tyvaso in the united states to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors accredo therapeutics  inc accredo  curascript  inc 
curascript  and cvs caremark caremark 
adcirca is sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers who are part of lilly s pharmaceutical wholesaler network 
the distribution of adcirca to patients through pharmaceutical wholesalers is similar to the distribution mechanism used by adcirca s main competitor  revatio 
the distribution of remodulin and tyvaso through specialty pharmaceutical distributors is similar to the distribution mechanisms of their main competitors  flolan and ventavis  respectively 
we also sell remodulin to distributors in other countries 
because discontinuation of remodulin or tyvaso therapy can be life threatening  we require our distributors to maintain minimum contingent inventory levels  consequently  sales of remodulin and tyvaso to our distributors in any given quarter may not be entirely indicative of patient demand 
our distributors typically place one bulk order per month based on their estimates of future demand and considerations of contractual minimum inventory requirements 
as such  sales of remodulin and tyvaso can be affected by the timing and magnitude of distributor orders 
other sources of revenue include telemedicine products and services in the united states 
our telemedicine products and services are designed to detect cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic heart disease  a condition that causes poor blood flow to the heart 
we operate in a highly competitive market 
for instance  a small number of pharmaceutical companies control a majority of the current pah therapies that are approved for use 
there are also a number of investigational products currently in development that  if approved  may erode the market share of our existing commercial therapies 
competing therapies may have a significant impact on our revenues 
we expect that the competition within our industry will only continue to increase 
expenses since our inception  we have devoted substantial resources toward our various research and development initiatives 
accordingly  we incur considerable costs related to our clinical trials and research  conducted both internally and by third parties  on a variety of projects to develop pharmaceutical products 
we also seek to license or acquire promising technologies and or compounds to be incorporated into our development pipeline 

table of contents major research and development projects our major research and development projects focus on the use of prostacyclin analogues and pde inhibitors to treat cardiovascular diseases  monoclonal antibodies to treat a variety of cancers  and glycobiology antiviral agents to treat infectious diseases 
cardiovascular disease projects tyvaso in november  we completed a phase iii clinical trial of tyvaso in patients with pah who were also treated with either tracleer  an oral endothelin receptor antagonist etra  or revatio  a pde inhibitor 
this clinical trial  called triumph  demonstrated a highly statistically significant improvement in median six minute walk distance  the endpoint primarily used to measure improvement in pah patients 
based on the favorable results of triumph  we submitted a new drug application nda in june to obtain fda approval to market tyvaso in the united states 
in addition  we filed a marketing authorization application maa in december for tyvaso with the european medicines agency ema using the centralized filing process 
in february  we withdrew our maa from consideration by the ema due to the ema s major objection related to findings of non compliance with good clinical practice gcp at two clinical sites 
the ema stated that these findings would preclude a recommendation for approval of tyvaso in the eu 
the ema had no major objections at the time of withdrawal related to the safety or efficacy of tyvaso 
on july   the fda approved tyvaso for the treatment of pah using the tyvaso inhalation system 
commercial sales of tyvaso began in september in connection with the tyvaso approval  we have agreed to a post marketing requirement pmr and certain post marketing commitments pmcs 
pmrs and pmcs are studies that sponsors conduct after fda approval to gather additional information about a product s safety  efficacy  or optimal use 
pmrs are required studies  whereas  a sponsor voluntarily commits to conduct pmcs 
we are required to provide the fda annual updates on our pmr and pmcs 
failure to complete the studies or adhere to the timelines set by the fda for the pmr could result in penalties  including fines or withdrawal of tyvaso from the market  unless we are able to demonstrate good cause for not completing the studies or adhering to our timelines 
in accordance with the pmr  we will conduct a long term observational study in the us that will include  patient years of follow up in tyvaso treated patients  and  patient years of follow up in matched control patients receiving other pah treatments to evaluate the potential association between tyvaso and oropharyngeal and pulmonary toxicity 
we have submitted a draft protocol of the pmr to the fda for review  and have committed to submitting the results by december  the pmc requires us to modify the tyvaso inhalation system in the following ways create a titratable breath counter  align key the dome of the device  add a battery back up power pack  and permanently fix the baffle plate to the dome 
as part of the re engineering process  we have also agreed to perform a usability analysis incorporating the evaluation and prioritization of user related risk followed by a human factors study  and we will conduct a study in healthy volunteers to collect pharmacokinetic data to verify expected dosing with the modified device 
we have submitted draft protocols for these pmcs to the fda for review  and we have committed to submitting a supplement to our tyvaso nda describing the results no later than october  the human factors study will commence in march  therefore  we believe we are well on track to meet the timeline for final report submission 
in december  we began enrolling patients in an open label study in the united states to investigate what occurs when patients on ventavis  another inhaled prostacyclin analogue  are switched to tyvaso 
the study is almost complete  but remains ongoing while we finish assessing study patients

data is being prepared for presentation at scientific symposia 
oral treprostinil in december  we initiated two clinical trials  freedom c and freedom m  to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral treprostinil in patients with pah 
the freedom c phase iii clinical trial was a study of patients currently on approved background therapy using a pde inhibitor  such as revatio  or an etra  such as tracleer  or a combination of both 
we completed enrollment for freedom c in may and in november  we announced that freedom c failed to achieve statistical significance 
preliminary analysis of the data revealed that the initial tablet strength was too high  which contributed to an inability to dose titrate increase the dose to tolerability and prevented the attainment of optimal dosing levels 
consequently  the overall treatment effect of the therapy was muted 
however  we believe that the results of the freedom c clinical trial  particularly as they relate to treatment effect and dosing  support our continued development of oral treprostinil 
accordingly  we commenced a second phase iii clinical trial  freedom c  to continue studying dosage and efficacy of oral treprostinil in pah patients on an approved background therapy 
enrollment in freedom c began in june the freedom m phase iii clinical trial is a week study of newly diagnosed pah patients not currently on any background therapy 
based on our observations from the freedom c clinical trial relating to patient tolerability and tablet strength  we submitted a protocol amendment to the fda in february to add patients to the ongoing freedom m trial 
these additional patients will be provided a lower strength tablet mg when they begin the trial and their doses will be titrated in mg increments  which we believe will improve tolerability 
in addition  our amendment to the freedom m protocol specifies that the primary statistical analysis of the trial will include only those patients who started the trial using the mg tablet 
by amending freedom m we hope to achieve the following objectives to assess more accurately the effectiveness of oral treprostinil  to improve patient tolerability of oral treprostinil so that an effective maintenance dose can be attained  and to reduce the rate of premature discontinuation due to adverse events 
the statistical assumptions of the amended protocol provide for power to observe a meter treatment benefit in six minute walk distance at the significance level of 
we believe the results of the protocol amendments will reflect the benefits of a favorable dosing regimen for oral treprostinil 
in april  we began enrolling patients in freedom m under the amended protocol 
beraprost mr pursuant to our license agreement with toray industries  inc toray  we are developing a modified release formulation of beraprost beraprost mr  an oral prostacyclin analogue  for the treatment of pah 
we have completed enrollment of a phase ii clinical trial of beraprost mr to explore multiple dose tolerability in patients with pah  and began a second phase ii clinical trial during the fourth quarter of the drug substance beraprost consists of equal amounts of four optical isomers  one of which is primarily responsible for the pharmacologic activity of the drug 
as we continue clinical development  we plan to explore the development of a modified release drug product containing only the most pharmacologically active isomer 
in october  beraprost mr received regulatory approval in japan for the treatment of pah  and in july  beraprost mr was designated an orphan medicinal product by the ema 
from inception to december   we have spent approximately million on these and other cardiovascular programs 

table of contents cancer disease projects in december  we entered into two agreements with memorial sloan kettering cancer center to license certain rights to two investigational monoclonal antibodies f and h for the treatment of neuroblastoma and metastatic brain cancer 
we have been granted orphan drug exclusivity in the united states and received a positive opinion from the committee on orphan medicinal products in the european union eu for the use of the f monoclonal antibody for the treatment of neuroblastoma 
in august  we began enrolling patients in a phase ii clinical trial of f for primary refractory neuroblastoma 
we have spent approximately million from inception to december   on this and earlier programs in our cancer platform 
infectious disease projects pursuant to our research agreement with the university of oxford oxford  we have the exclusive right to commercialize a platform of glycobiology antiviral drug candidates in various preclinical and clinical stages of testing for the treatment of a wide variety of viruses 
through our research agreement with oxford  we are also supporting research into new glycobiology antiviral drug candidates and technologies 
we are currently testing many of these compounds in preclinical studies and oxford continues to synthesize new agents 
we have spent approximately million from inception to december   on our infectious disease programs 
cost of product sales cost of product sales comprises costs to manufacture or acquire products sold to customers 
we manufacture treprostinil using advanced intermediate compounds purchased in bulk from several third party vendors who have the capacity to produce greater quantities of these compounds more cost effectively than we do 
in  we received both fda and eu approval to produce treprostinil in our silver spring  maryland  laboratory facility phase i laboratory 
our manufacturing process has been designed to give us the flexibility to produce both treprostinil diethanolamine the form of treprostinil used in our oral tablet and treprostinil used to produce tyvaso and subcutaneous and intravenous remodulin efficiently in proportion to forecasted demand 
we acquired the rights to the tyvaso inhalation system from nebu tec in september for and for part of  the tyvaso starter kits  consisting of two nebulizers and days of drug and daily supplies  contain nebulizers manufactured by nebu tec prior to our acquisition of that business 
because the starter kits contain two nebulizers  the cost of product sales for the starter kits is higher than the monthly resupply kits  which contain days of drug and daily supplies but no nebulizer 
we use contract manufacturers to produce all of our products for commercial use 
we extended our contract with baxter pharmaceutical solutions  llc baxter  through and as part of that contract amendment we have agreed that remodulin will be manufactured on larger production equipment and in larger quantities than the current manufacturing process 
this new manufacturing process and related equipment will require fda approval 
we are also evaluating alternative supply arrangements  including other third party production arrangements and the manufacture of remodulin and tyvaso in our combination office and laboratory facility that we recently completed in silver spring  maryland phase ii facility 
during  we increased our inventory of remodulin and tyvaso from two years of expected demand to three years of expected demand to ensure that we maintain adequate levels at all times 
in addition  we have increased our inventory levels of treprostinil based compounds to meet similar levels 
in conjunction with this projected increase in inventory  we obtained approval in the us and europe to extend the shelf life of remodulin from months to months 

table of contents future prospects because pah is a progressive disease without a cure  many patients continue to deteriorate on currently approved therapies 
this presents market growth opportunities for remodulin  tyvaso and adcirca as viable alternatives or complements to existing therapies 
furthermore  we anticipate that the market for our commercial products will continue to expand as more patients are diagnosed with pah each year 
we have experienced annual revenue growth in excess of percent since remodulin was first approved in one of our principal objectives is to maintain this level of growth 
the continued achievement of this objective will depend upon the success of our commercial development of products within our pipeline and our ability to treat a broader spectrum of pah patients 
to this end  we continue to develop oral treprostinil and seek to expand the use of our therapies to treat patients at earlier stages in the pah disease pathway 
with the commercial introduction of tyvaso and adcirca  we now expect to reach pah patients along the full continuum of the disease 
we believe the outcome of our freedom m and freedom c phase iii clinical trials of oral treprostinil will be successful 
furthermore  we anticipate that the products developed under these clinical trials will generate future sources of revenue 
however  prior to fda approval of oral treprostinil for marketing  we could be required to perform additional studies 
this could cause unexpected delays in the commercialization of oral treprostinil and could impede our anticipated revenue growth 
our future growth and profitability will depend on many factors including  among many others the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  including the pmc and pmr relating to the fda s approval of tyvaso  the timing of the commercial launch of new products  the pricing of and demand for our products and services  reimbursement of our products by public and private insurance organizations  and the competition we face within our industry 
financial position cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments excluding all restricted amounts at december   were million  compared to approximately million as of december  the increase in cash and marketable investments was driven mainly by continued significant sales growth and related cash receipts from sales of remodulin and the launch of adcirca and tyvaso  the reduction in construction related expenditures as we completed the construction of our facility in research triangle park  north carolina  during the first quarter of  and million in net proceeds received from the exercise of stock options less cash paid for the exercise of awards granted under the united therapeutics corporation share tracking awards plan stap during the twelve month period ended december  restricted cash and marketable investments were million at december   and were comprised of million pledged as security for our phase i laboratory and million placed in the united therapeutics corporation supplemental executive retirement plan rabbi trust document rabbi trust 
at december   the components of our restricted cash and marketable investments were million pledged as security for our phase i laboratory and million placed in the rabbi trust 
accounts receivable at december   was million  as compared to million at december  the million increase was due to higher remodulin sales in the quarter ended december   as compared to the quarter ended december   and the commercial launch of tyvaso september inventory increased million during the year ended december   to million as a result of our efforts to increase our inventories of remodulin  tyvaso and treprostinil from a two year supply to a three year supply based on current demand 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets increased by approximately million  from million at december   to million at december  the increase resulted from the acquisition of the tyvaso inhalation systems business from nebu tec in september property  plant and equipment at december   was million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase was driven by expenditures for our construction projects in maryland and north carolina during the twelve month period ended december  construction of our north carolina facility was completed in february and construction of our phase ii facility in silver spring  maryland  was completed in december other current liabilities increased by million from million at december   to million at december  since december   our liability for the stap has increased by approximately million primarily as a result of the appreciation in the price of our common stock and the normal vesting accrual of outstanding awards 
the increase in stap liability was partially offset by a million reduction in taxes payable  which resulted from estimated tax payments 
the classification of our million convertible senior notes due october convertible senior notes shifted from a non current liability at december   to a current liability at december   because the contingent conversion criteria had been satisfied at december   and the convertible senior notes are therefore convertible at the election of their holders note holders 
specifically  the closing price of our common stock exceeded of the initial conversion price for more than days during the consecutive trading day period ending on december  this conversion determination is measured as of the end of each quarter 
accordingly  classification of the convertible senior notes may change in future quarters 
other noncurrent liabilities at december   were million as compared to million at december  the million increase is primarily the result of the million contingent consideration liability recorded in connection with the purchase of the tyvaso inhalation system business from nebu tec 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more details on this arrangement 
stockholders equity was approximately million at december   compared to approximately million at december  the increase of million in stockholders equity was driven in large part by the following net income of million  million in net proceeds from the exercise of stock options  and the recognition of million in share based compensation

we pay government rebates to state medicaid agencies that pay for our commercial products 
in addition  we may enter into contractual arrangements with third party payers to provide a rebate to these payers for the cost of therapy 
we estimate our liability for these rebates based on the historical level of invoices received from state medicaid agencies and third party payers by product relative to the specific sales of each product in the united states

prompt pay discounts are offered on sales of our commercial products if the related invoices are paid in full within a specific time period from the date of sale 
we estimate our liability for prompt pay discounts based on historical payment patterns 
fees paid to our distributors for services are estimated based on contractual rates for specific services applied to the estimated units of service provided by our distributors for the period 
the allowance for sales returns for adcirca is based on published industry data related to specialty pharmaceuticals  as that segment of industry data is most relevant to adcirca 
the allowance for exchanges for remodulin is based on historical sale exchanges  which have been too immaterial to record 
since tyvaso is distributed in the same manner and under similar contractual arrangements as remodulin  we are estimating that tyvaso will experience the same sales exchange pattern as remodulin

expenses associated with our inhaled and oral treprostinil programs increased by approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in expenditures related to these programs resulted from activities associated with the progression of ongoing clinical trials  the filing for regulatory approval for inhaled treprostinil in the united states and the eu  and the announcement of the results of the freedom c trial of oral treprostinil 
in addition  during the year ended december   expenses incurred in connection with the development of beraprost mr rose by approximately million when compared to the year ended december  this increase was largely attributable to milestone payments made to toray pursuant to our license agreement for the development of beraprost mr 
lastly  the growth during of our clinical staff to focus on new and investigational cardiovascular projects resulted in a corresponding increase in salaries and related expenses of approximately million 
cardiovascular license fees 
during the quarter ended december   we made a one time  upfront payment of million pursuant to a license agreement and a related manufacturing and 
table of contents supply agreement entered into with lilly regarding the commercialization of adcirca 
we expensed these payments as research and development since adcirca had not yet been approved for marketing by the fda and therefore commercial feasibility had not been demonstrated at that time

consequently  expenditures associated with our cancer programs decreased substantially in the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  share based compensation 
the increase in share based compensation in resulted from achievement awards in connection with the attainment of specific company wide performance milestones of which a portion is paid with awards granted under the stap  and an increase in the number of employees during the the table below summarizes selling  general and administrative expense by major category dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change category general and administrative sales and marketing share based compensation total selling  general and administrative expense general and administrative

in addition  professional fees rose by approximately million in and relate to services provided in connection with prospective and consummated business transactions during the year 
the increases in personnel related expenses and professional fees were partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in impairment related charges during sales and marketing 
for the year ended december   personnel related costs increased by approximately million as a direct result of increases in departmental headcount 
in addition  expenses associated with new marketing campaigns and initiatives and other promotional activities rose by approximately million during share based compensation 
during the year ended december   we recognized share based compensation expense of approximately million  representing the fair value of the chief executive officer s year end stock option grant  which is determined based on a formula set forth in her employment agreement 
based on this formula  our chief executive officer did not receive a stock option grant for the year ended december  the decrease in share based compensation recognized relating to this award was partially offset by an increase in share based compensation of approximately million in and resulted from achievement awards in connection with our company wide milestone incentive bonus program of which a portion is paid with awards granted under the stap  and an increase in our total number of employees in income tax benefit 
as a result of our net loss incurred before income taxes for the year ended december   we recognized income tax benefits of million for the year then ended 
for the year ended december   we recognized income tax benefits of approximately million  resulting principally from the generation of business tax credits during the year for our orphan drug related research and development activities 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since fda approval of remodulin in  funding for our operations has been derived principally from related revenues 
we believe that our existing revenues and working capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations as demand for remodulin has grown steadily since furthermore  our customer base remains stable and  we believe  presents minimal credit risk 
during the quarter ended september   we launched adcirca and tyvaso for commercial sale 
we anticipate that these new products will generate significant future revenues and cash flows 
however  any projections of future cash flows are inherently subject to uncertainty 
to compensate for such uncertainty  we may seek other sources of funding and believe we have the ability to do so 
see item a risk factors we have a history of losses and may not maintain profitability and item a risk factors we may fail to meet third party projections for our revenues or profits 
operating cash flows and working capital net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million in net cash used by operating activities for the year ended december  in  net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to our significantly higher revenues in over and the one time  upfront  non refundable payment in of million to lilly in connection with our license for the commercial rights to adcirca 
the effect of this acquisition expense  net of tax  reduced our cash provided by operating activities in by approximately million 
at december   we had negative working capital of million compared to positive working capital of million at december  the decrease is primarily due to the reclassification of our convertible senior notes from long term debt to short term debt as of december   because they became eligible for conversion by the note holders 
our expectation  based on our understanding of historical behavior of holders of convertible notes with terms similar to ours  is that our convertible senior notes will continue to be held until they mature in october consequently  we believe that we have approximately million of working capital available at december   for our operating needs 
in addition  at december   we had approximately million of long term meaning the security is set to mature more than one year from december  marketable securities that could be liquidated if necessary to fund our operations 
most of these securities are scheduled to mature prior to october when our convertible senior notes are set to mature 
lastly  we had approximately million shares of vested stock options outstanding at december   with a weighted average exercise price of per share 
these vested stock options  if exercised  would provide us with million of additional cash 
auction rate securities as of december   we hold approximately million par value of illiquid auction rate securities ars 
the decline in fair value of ars  including ours  reflects conditions relating to the general collapse of the credit markets 
our ars are collateralized by student loan portfolios that are approximately guaranteed by the federal government and maintain a credit rating of aaa 
historically  ars provided liquidity to investors through their interest rate reset feature ie  interest rates on these securities are reset through a bidding process or auction at frequent  pre determined intervals typically every to days 
at each reset date  investors can choose to either maintain their holdings or liquidate them at par value 
since february  auctions related to our ars have failed  rendering these securities illiquid 
to mitigate the risks associated with our ars  we entered into an auction rate securities rights offer rights offer during the fourth quarter of with the investment firm that maintains our 
table of contents ars account 
pursuant to the rights offer  we can sell our ars to the investment firm for a price equal to their par value at any time between june   and july  in addition  to help meet any immediate liquidity needs  the rights offer permits us to borrow up to the par value of the ars 
the rights offer provides us with additional flexibility to recover the full cost of our investment prior to the maturity of these securities 
we expect to sell our ars to the investment firm on the earliest date agreed to under the rights offer and do not anticipate borrowing against the ars while the rights offer remains open 
construction projects in february  we completed the construction of our facility in research triangle park  north carolina rtp facility at a cost of approximately million 
the rtp facility is approximately  square feet and consists of a manufacturing operation and office space 
the manufacturing operation will be used primarily for the production of oral treprostinil 
in addition  it is expected that the rtp facility will support the production and distribution of other drug candidates that we are developing 
currently  we warehouse and distribute tyvaso from our rtp facility 
our clinical development  regulatory and sales and marketing personnel occupy the facility s office space 
in december  we completed construction of our phase ii facility  which is attached to our phase i laboratory  at a cost of approximately million 
the phase ii facility will serve as our corporate headquarters and we anticipate manufacturing remodulin  tyvaso and monoclonal antibodies in the new facility 
in may  we amended the terms of our november guaranteed maximum price construction management agreement with the whiting turner contracting company whiting turner for the construction of the phase ii facility 
the may amendment converted the guaranteed maximum price into a lump sum and increased our total obligation from approximately million to million  as a result of several change orders previously agreed upon with whiting turner 
our remaining obligation associated with this contract is million as of december  both the rtp facility and the phase ii facility were funded using cash provided by our operations 
during the years ended december  and  we spent approximately million and million  respectively  on to the construction of the rtp facility and the phase ii facility 
as of december   inception to date expenditures related to these construction projects approached million 
share tracking awards plan awards granted under the stap entitle participants to receive in cash the appreciation in our common stock  which is calculated as the positive difference between the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant and the date of exercise 
accordingly  the stap will require substantial cash payments as awards continue to vest and participants continue to exercise them 
our operating budgets incorporate anticipated outlays of cash relating to the stap 
beginning in  we have modified the metrics used to calculate the number of awards to be granted to each eligible employee to reduce such grants 
additionally  beginning in november  we extended the vesting period for new awards from three years to four years 
we believe future cash flows will be sufficient to accommodate our obligations under the stap and the future operating requirements of our business 
convertible senior notes on october   we issued at par value million of convertible senior notes 
we pay interest on the convertible senior notes semi annually on april and october of each year approximately million annually 
the convertible senior notes are unsecured  unsubordinated debt obligations that rank equally with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 

table of contents conversion can occur anytime after july   during any calendar quarter that follows a calendar quarter in which the price of our common stock exceeded of the conversion price for at least days during the consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the quarter  during the ten consecutive trading day period following any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the convertible senior notes was less than of the closing price of our common stock multiplied by the then current number of shares underlying the convertible senior notes  upon specified distributions to our shareholders  in connection with corporate transactions  or in the event that our common stock ceases to be listed on the nasdaq global select market and is not listed for trading on another us national or regional securities exchange 
upon conversion  a holder of our convertible senior notes will receive cash equal to the lesser of the principal amount of the note or the conversion value equal to the number of shares underlying the convertible senior notes multiplied by the then current conversion price per share  and to the extent the conversion value exceeds the principal amount of the convertible senior notes  shares of our common stock 
in the event of a change in control  as defined in the indenture under which the convertible senior notes have been issued  holders can require us to purchase from them all or a portion of their convertible senior notes for of the principal value plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
because the convertible senior notes include contingent conversion provisions  note holders may be able to convert their convertible senior notes prior to october as of december   the convertible senior notes were convertible at the election of their holders as the closing price of our common stock satisfied quarterly contingent conversion requirements 
however  it is our expectation  based on our understanding of the historical behavior of holders of convertible notes with terms similar to ours  that most  if not all of our outstanding convertible senior notes will be held until maturity 
lease obligation we lease our phase i laboratory pursuant to a synthetic lease arrangement lease entered into in june with wachovia development corporation and its affiliates wachovia 
under the lease  wachovia funded million toward the construction of the phase i laboratory on land that we own 
after completing construction in may  wachovia leased the phase i laboratory to us 
monthly rent is equal to the day london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points as of december  applied to the amount wachovia funded toward construction 
the base term of the lease ends in may base term 
upon the expiration of the base term  we will have the right to exercise one of the following options under the lease renew the lease for an additional five year term subject to the approval of both parties  purchase the phase i laboratory from wachovia for approximately million  or sell the phase i laboratory and repay wachovia s construction costs with the proceeds from the sale 
if the sale proceeds are insufficient to repay wachovia s construction costs  we must fund the shortfall up to a maximum residual value guarantee of approximately million 
from the inception of the lease through august  we accounted for the lease as an operating lease 
in december  we began constructing the phase ii facility with funds generated from our operations 
as of september   we received wachovia s acknowledgement of our plan to make structural modifications to the phase i laboratory in order to connect it to the phase ii facility 
as a result  we could no longer consider the phase i laboratory a standalone structure  which was required to maintain off balance sheet accounting for the lease 
consequently  since september   we have been considered the owners of the phase i laboratory for accounting purposes and began accounting for the lease as a financing obligation 
accordingly  we capitalized million  the estimated fair value of the phase i laboratory  and recognized a corresponding lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are accreting the lease obligation to million  the purchase price of the phase i laboratory  through the recognition of periodic interest charges using the effective interest 
table of contents method 
the accretion period will run through the end of the base term 
in addition  we are depreciating the phase i laboratory over the estimated useful lives of its various components 
approximately million of our marketable investments at december   have been pledged as collateral for the lease and are included within restricted marketable investments and cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
common stock subject to repurchase in march  we amended our june agreement with toray to expand our rights to commercialize beraprost mr 
pursuant to our amended agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to toray in march the terms of our amended agreement give toray the right to request that we repurchase these shares at the price of per share upon days prior written notice 
to date  toray has not notified us that it intends to ask us to repurchase these shares 
license fees under our existing license agreements  we are obligated to make royalty payments on net sales of remodulin and tyvaso at a rate of ten percent of net sales once the annual combined net sales exceed million 
in addition  we pay lilly a pass through five percent royalty on net sales of adcirca 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations at december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years convertible senior notes lease obligations obligations under construction commitments operating lease obligations obligations under the stap obligations under the supplemental executive retirement plan serp purchase commitments milestone payments total the principal balance of the convertible senior notes is to be repaid in cash 
while the convertibility of the convertible senior notes may vary depending on whether our stock price meets specified criteria  which is determined on a quarterly basis  we estimate that the note holders will not convert their notes until maturity 
the lease obligation assumes we elect the purchase option under our wachovia lease at the end of the base term 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more details on this arrangement 
amounts remaining due on the whiting turner construction management contract 

table of contents we estimated the obligation based on the intrinsic value of outstanding stap awards expected to vest as of december  assuming that awards will be exercised immediately upon vesting 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more details on this arrangement 
obligations under the serp are actuarially derived and represent the estimated future payout of this benefit to certain members of our management team 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more details on this arrangement 
we license products from other companies under various license agreements 
these agreements require that we make specific cash payments upon the achievement of specific product development milestones and commercialization 
the timing and amounts of related milestone payments have been estimated based on when we believe milestones will be achieved  and the assumption that all milestones established within these license agreements will be successfully attained 
as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the contractual obligations disclosed above exclude these amounts due to the uncertainty surrounding the amounts and timing of future payments 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  these estimates and assumptions can change and impact amounts reported in the future 
we have identified the following accounting policies  which require the use of our judgment and estimation in their application 
we consider these policies to be critical because of the degree of judgment that is inherent in their application 
revenue recognition remodulin and tyvaso we sell both remodulin and tyvaso to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors under similar terms 
sales of remodulin and tyvaso  including the tyvaso inhalation system  are recognized when title and risk of ownership pass to our distributors upon delivery to our distributors facilities 
we record sales of remodulin and tyvaso net of product sales allowances 
these sales allowances consist of prompt payment discounts  medicaid and third party payer rebates and fees for services provided by our distributors 
calculating these allowances involves the use of significant estimates and judgments and information from external sources 
sales allowances are estimated and recognized as reductions to revenue in the period that associated revenues are recognized 
prompt pay discounts are calculated based on the gross amount of invoices and are recorded on a net basis as our distributors have routinely taken advantage of these discounts 
medicaid rebates are generally invoiced and paid in the subsequent quarter from the date of sale 
accruals and related revenue reductions for medicaid rebates are based on historical rebate data adjusted for anticipated changes in product sales trends and government rebate programs with regard to eligibility requirements and or rebate pricing 
we analyze rebate data separately for remodulin and tyvaso  as these therapies have been developed to treat pah patients at different stages in the disease continuum and therefore  rebate eligibility and pricing requirements can differ for each therapy 
in the future we may be contractually obligated pay a rebate to certain third party payers to offset the cost of our therapies 
while we had no such contractual rebate obligations to third party payers in or in prior years  we expect to be contractually obligated to pay rebates to certain third party payers a rebate in and beyond 
as a result  we have included the review of third party payer data into our revenue recognition policy 

table of contents we pay our distributors for contractual services rendered 
accruals for these fees are estimated based on contracted rates applied to the estimated units of service provided by distributors for a given period 
our distributors do not possess return rights  however  we provide exchange rights in the event that product was damaged during shipment  or has expired 
the shelf life of remodulin and tyvaso is three years from the date of manufacture 
the number of product exchanges requested by our distributors has been very small because we sell remodulin and tyvaso with a shelf life generally in excess of one year before their expiration and our distributors generally hold a to day inventory of our products 
in addition  we do not require  nor do we provide incentives for our distributors to assume  inventory levels of remodulin or tyvaso beyond what would be considered reasonable and customary in the ordinary course of business and we closely track inventory levels in the distribution channels 
accordingly  any exchange for expired product has generally occurred many months after the period of initial sale 
in addition  exchanges for damaged product have occurred very infrequently 
when remodulin or tyvaso has been damaged in shipment to the distributor  we have been promptly notified and we do not recognize revenue on that shipment until the damaged product has been replaced  generally within several days after we are notified of the damage 
with respect to remodulin  the financial effects of this exchange right have been immaterial and we expect the historic volume of exchanges to remain consistent in the future 
obsolescence due to dating expiration has been minimal given the fast pace at which remodulin moves through the distribution channel 
specifically  remodulin exchanges have comprised substantially less than one percent of the volume of vials that we sell 
because historical and anticipated future returns associated with exchange rights for remodulin have been  and are expected to be  immaterial  we do not record a reserve for estimated exchange rights in the period of sale 
because our distribution system for tyvaso is so similar to that for remodulin  we expect a similarly immaterial financial impact of exchange rights with respect to tyvaso 
accordingly  we have not recognized a reserve for anticipated future exchanges of tyvaso 
lastly  we closely monitor exchange data for both of these therapies to ensure that our assumptions continue to be reasonable  appropriate and current 
adcirca adcirca is manufactured for us by lilly and distributed through lilly s well established pharmaceutical wholesaler network 
this type of distribution is similar to the way adcirca s main competitor  revatio  is distributed 
specifically  lilly handles all of the administrative functions associated with the sale of adcirca on our behalf  including the receipt and processing of customer purchase orders  shipment of adcirca to customers  and the invoicing and collection of customer payments 
in addition  sales terms for adcirca include return rights that extend throughout the distribution channel 
we recognize sales of adcirca on a gross basis net of allowances upon delivery to customers because we are responsible for the acceptability of the product purchased by lilly s wholesalers  we bear all inventory risk  as title and risk of loss pass to us at the shipping point from lilly s manufacturing facility  we assume credit risk if lilly is unable to collect amounts due from customers  and we assume the risk and cost of a product recall  if required 
adcirca revenues are recognized net of the following sales allowances reserves for product returns  medicaid and third party payer rebates  prompt pay discounts  non pah sales  if any  and wholesaler fees 
calculation of these allowances involves the use of significant judgments and estimates 
we have based initial estimates for returns on published industry data related to specialty pharmaceuticals  as that segment of industry data is most relevant to adcirca 
in addition  we compare patient prescription data to sales quarterly to see if both the prescription and sales patterns are reasonably similar 
allowances for medicaid rebates are derived from our experience with remodulin as we believe that the treatment population as it relates to medicaid patients is similar 
while we had no contractual obligation to pay a rebate to third party payers in  we expect to be contractually obligated to pay 
table of contents a rebate to certain third party payers in as a result  we include the review of third party payer data into our revenue recognition policy 
prompt pay discounts are based on contractual terms with our distributors  and they generally take advantage of such discounts 
we analyze our sales data to determine if any sales of adcirca are for the treatment of an illness other than pulmonary hypertension 
pursuant to our agreements with lilly  we do not recognize non pulmonary hypertension sales of adcirca as revenue 
lastly  wholesaler fees are based on the contractual fee percentage for each wholesaler and sales to that wholesaler 
marketable investments most of our marketable securities are classified as held to maturity 
for those marketable investments whose fair value is lower than its book value  we are required to periodically review whether the decline in the value of the security is other than temporary 
this review requires us to make judgments  particularly as they relate to the extent and duration of a decline in the fair value of a security  the probability  extent and timing of a recovery of a security s value  our assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security prior to recovery of its amortized cost and our estimation of the present value of the cash flows we would expect to collect that are attributable to an impaired debt security to determine whether a credit loss exists 
the scope of this evaluation requires forward looking assessments pertaining to a security and the relevant financial markets  an issuer s financial condition and business outlook  and our estimation of the value of cash flows we would expect to collect from an issuer upon maturity of an impaired security 
accordingly  we must make assessments regarding current conditions and future events  which involve a considerable degree of uncertainty and judgment 
when we determine that the decline in value of a security is other than temporary  we are required to recognize the credit loss portion as a charge within our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we classify certain marketable investments as held to maturity because we believe we have the positive intent and ability to hold related securities until they mature 
this assertion requires us to make forward looking judgments regarding our future cash flow requirements relative to the maturity dates of such securities 
to reduce the level of uncertainty associated in making this determination  we invest in debt securities that mature within two years 
fair value measurements we are required to disclose assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements within a specified fair value hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to fair value measurements based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to fair value measurements derived through the use of unobservable inputs level measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy  in their entirety  based on the lowest level input that is significant to the related fair value measurement 
determining where within the fair value hierarchy a particular asset or liability should be disclosed involves judgment regarding the significance of inputs relative to a fair value measurement and where such inputs lie within the fair value hierarchy 
furthermore  securities that are illiquid  or are not traded  have little or no price transparency 
as such  estimating the fair value of our level securities involves the use of significant subjective assumptions that we believe market participants would consider in pricing such securities 
we employ a discounted cash flow model to help us estimate the fair value of our level securities 
accordingly  inputs to the model that include estimating the amounts and timing of expected cash flows  the expected term of the securities and a discount rate appropriately adjusted for illiquidity or other risks involve a significant degree of judgment 
we use consultants who are experts on valuation techniques to aid us in our determination of the fair value of our level assets 

table of contents investment in affiliate we use the equity method of accounting for our investment in northern therapeutics  inc northern 
the equity method of accounting requires that we report our share of northern s net losses or earnings in our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation is not required unless we possess the ability to control northern 
generally  the ability to exercise control over an entity occurs when voting interests in that entity exceed 
we maintain an ownership interest in northern of approximately 
however  because northern s minority owners have substantive participation rights  we concluded that we do not have the ability to control northern s operations 
therefore  northern s financial statements have not been included in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the asset and liability method set forth under asc accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
evaluating the realizability of deferred assets requires us to review forecasts of earnings and taxable income  among other considerations 
accordingly  the evaluation process as it relates to the realizability of deferred tax assets requires us to make significant judgments and forward looking assessments regarding amounts and the availability of future taxable income 
financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is determined based on a more likely than not threshold of that position being sustained 
if the tax position meets this threshold  the benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting for uncertain tax positions involves considerable judgment in assessing the future tax consequences of amounts that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in amounts different from those recognized on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets we are required to test goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
evaluating goodwill for impairment requires judgment particularly as it relates to determining the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned 
we use a discounted cash flow model to test goodwill for impairment  which involves the use of significant and subjective inputs 
inputs requiring our judgment include  among others  the estimation of future cash flows  future growth rates and profitability of a reporting unit and the expected life related cash flows will occur 
changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its estimated fair value 
we also test our intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
evaluating intangible assets for impairment requires judgment particularly as it relates to determining the fair value of the license or business to which the intangible asset represents 
we use a discounted cash flow model to test an intangible asset for impairment  which involves the use of significant and subjective inputs 
related inputs  among others  requiring our judgment include the estimation of future cash flows  future growth rates and profitability of business activity and the expected life related cash flows will occur 
changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in 
table of contents market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of the intangible asset over its estimated fair value 
the creation of goodwill or an intangible asset through an acquisition  such as our acquisition of the tyvaso inhalation system business from nebu tec  requires significant judgment 
the acquisition of a business requires us to determine the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed and what rights acquired have a value  and then determining the fair value of those acquired rights using the same inputs that we use to determine if goodwill or an intangible asset is impaired 
we use consultants who are experts on valuation techniques to aid us in our determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities we acquire 
phase i laboratory lease we lease our phase i laboratory pursuant to a synthetic lease arrangement lease entered into in june with wachovia 
under the lease  wachovia funded million toward the construction of the phase i laboratory on land that we own 
after completing construction in may  wachovia leased the phase i laboratory to us 
from the inception of the lease through august  we accounted for the lease as an operating lease 
in december  we began constructing the phase ii facility with funds generated from our operations

consequently  beginning september   we have been considered the owner of the phase i laboratory for accounting purposes and have accounted for the lease as a financing obligation 
accordingly  we capitalized million  the estimated fair value of the phase i laboratory  and recognized a corresponding lease obligation on our consolidated balance sheet 
we are accreting the lease obligation to million  the purchase price of the phase i laboratory  through the recognition of periodic interest charges using the effective interest method 
the accretion period will run through the end of the base term 
in addition  we are depreciating the phase i laboratory over the estimated useful lives of its various components 
pension benefit obligation accounting for our supplemental executive retirement plan serp requires that we recognize on our consolidated balance sheet a liability equal to the unfunded status of the serp equal to the projected benefit obligation  as we do not fund the serp and measure our projected benefit obligation as of the end of our fiscal year 
estimating the serp obligation involves the use of judgment and estimates 
the serp obligation and related pension expense are derived from actuarial valuations that are developed using a number of assumptions 
a key assumption to the valuation is the discount rate 
the discount rate should be representative of the rate associated with high quality  fixed income debt securities 
with the overall economic downturn and the tightening of the credit markets that began in  interest rates  in general  have been decreasing 
we must consider these economic factors when determining an appropriate discount rate to employ 
consequently  the discount rate we used to measure our obligation as of december   was approximately basis points lower than the rate we used as of december  changes in the discount rate can significantly decrease or increase our serp obligation 
for instance  a reduction in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation  result in an actuarial loss and possibly cause additional pension expense to be recognized in future financial reporting periods on our consolidated statements of operations if certain thresholds have been met as of the beginning of a given financial reporting period 
other actuarial assumptions include participant demographics such as the expected rate of salary increases and withdrawal rates  among other factors 
actual experience may differ from actuarial assumptions 
changes in any of these assumptions can also affect the measurement of the serp obligation 

table of contents share based compensation our share based awards are classified as either equity stock options or as liabilities stap awards and compensation expense to be recognized is determined based on the fair value of related awards 
we estimate the fair value of all share based awards using the black scholes merton valuation model 
valuation models  like the black scholes merton model  require the use of subjective assumptions that could materially impact the estimation of fair value and related compensation expense to be recognized 
these assumptions include  among others  the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of awards and the expected forfeiture rate 
developing these assumptions requires the use of judgment 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu no 

asu no 
requires fair value disclosures of assets and liabilities by class  disclosures about significant transfers in and out of levels and on the fair value hierarchy  in addition to level  purchases  sales  issuances and settlements be disclosed on gross basis on the reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of level assets and liabilities  and disclosures about valuation methods and inputs used to measure the fair value of level assets and liabilities 
asu no 
becomes effective for the first financial reporting period beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level assets and liabilities  which will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing what impact  if any  asu no

in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities asu no 

asu requires a qualitative approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and replaces the quantitative evaluation previously set forth under fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this approach is focused on identifying the reporting entity that has the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly affects the entity s economic performance and has the obligation to absorb the entity s losses or has the right to receive benefits from the entity 
asu no 
 among other things  will require enhanced disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement in variable interest entities 
the guidance under asu no

in addition  asu eliminates the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration and instead requires allocation using the relative selling price method 
asu will be effective prospectively for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements entered into  or materially modified  in fiscal years beginning on or after june  presently  we are assessing what impact  if any  the adoption of asu may have on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we held investments of approximately million par value in auction rate securities ars 
we are exposed to market risk related to our ars as a result of the general collapse of the credit markets and the continued uncertainty surrounding the financial markets 
the ars maintain an aaa credit rating and are backed by student loan portfolios that are approximately guaranteed by the federal government 
however  since february  auctions for the ars have failed  rendering these securities illiquid 
consequently  the fair value of our ars has declined significantly 
as of december   the estimated fair value of these securities was approximately million 
because we classify our ars as trading securities  all future changes in fair value will be recognized within earnings until the securities are liquidated or otherwise disposed 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that the ars will ever fully recover their value 
to mitigate market related risks associated with our investment  we entered into an auction rate securities rights offer rights offer  under which we have an option to require the investment firm the counterparty to the rights offer to repurchase the ars at a price equal to their par value anytime between june  and july  put option 
the put option has been recognized at fair value as a financial asset on our consolidated balance sheets and subsequent changes in its fair value will be recognized within earnings 
we expect the future price movements relating to the ars and the put option to largely offset one another ie  as the value of the ars decreases  we would expect the rights associated with the put option to increase in value 
however  the rights offer and the related put option still expose us to counterparty credit risk 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments varies inversely with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
similarly  as rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to address market risk  we invest in debt securities that mature within two years and hold these investments to maturity so that they can be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   our investments in debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies had a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately percent 
these investments mature at various times through and many are callable annually 
there has been a prolonged period of significant deterioration and instability in the financial markets that has persisted into this period of extraordinary disruption and readjustment in the financial markets exposes us to additional investment risk 
the value and liquidity of the securities in which we invest could deteriorate and the issuers of such securities could be subject to credit rating downgrades 
in light of the current market conditions and the additional risks to which we may be exposed  we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest 
we believe that we take a conservative approach to investing our funds in that we invest exclusively in highly rated securities with relatively short maturities 
furthermore  we do not invest in the types of securities that expose us to undue risk 
while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks  such risks cannot be fully eliminated  as circumstances can occur that are beyond our control
