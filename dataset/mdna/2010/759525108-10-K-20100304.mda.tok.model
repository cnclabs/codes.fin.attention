item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our financial and operating results for improved significantly from the prior year 
this included increased total sales  increased p digital sales  and reduced operating expenses  all of which combined to yield operating income for the year versus last year s operating loss 
we also reduced inventory and eliminated long term debt  while enhancing our cash and trade receivables positions 
total sales for increased to approximately million compared with million for the prior year 
sales of p digital products more than doubled to approximately million in from million in previously announced orders from the us departments of defense  agriculture and interior during the year contributed to our sales growth 
these larger orders were supplemented by continued strengthening in the flow of lower value daily run rate procurements and a larger addressable market made possible by our expanded line of new kng products 
importantly  we realized market share gains in with several federal agencies 
according to procurement information published by the federal government  total spending by these agencies decreased in compared to  however their purchases of relm products increased 
improved gross margins as a percentage of sales in compared with were primarily the result of increased manufacturing volumes and a more favorable mix of higher margin digital product sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased approximately million compared with last year as certain engineering initiatives were completed and expense reductions were implemented 
we continued  however  to invest in product development  resulting in the addition of several products to our kng line  supplementing those that were introduced in these products are expected to increase our addressable markets 
we anticipate adding more new products to the kng line during the course of pretax income for increased to approximately million compared with a pretax loss of approximately million last year 
we recognized income tax expense of approximately million compared with an income tax benefit of approximately million last year 
our income tax expense and benefit for all periods reported primarily relate to deferred items including as nol carryforward 
net income for increased to approximately million per basic share and per fully diluted share  compared with a net loss of approximately million per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
during  we reduced net inventories by approximately million 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash and million in working capital  with no long term debt 
our turnaround in is encouraging  however  general economic conditions and the business climate for land mobile radios remain challenging 
results of operations as an aid to understanding our operating results  the following table shows items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percent of sales percent of sales for years ended december sales cost of products gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses net interest expense income other income expense income loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in increased million to approximately million compared with million for the prior year 
sales of p digital products in increased million to approximately million  compared with million for orders announced in  primarily for p digital products from the us departments of defense dod  agriculture and interior during the year contributed to our sales growth 
the orders from the dod are particularly important  as they represent sales to new customers  and for products in frequencies that we historically did not offer 
these larger orders were supplemented by a strengthening in the flow of smaller run rate procurements and an expanded addressable market made possible by our line of new kng products 
we believe our late inclusion in a blanket purchase agreement bpa from the us general services administration was a contributing factor 
the total estimated value of this bpa is million to various suppliers over a maximum term of five years  and it is being utilized by various federal government agencies for the purchase of a wide range of analog and p digital radio equipment 
likewise  we believe our inclusion in a contract issued by the u 
s 
internal revenue service issued in december has positive implications for future sales growth 
we realized market share gains in with several federal agencies 
according to procurement information published by the federal government  total spending by these agencies decreased in compared to  however their purchases of relm products increased 
within the past year we have significantly expanded our p digital product offerings with the introduction of new radio models  some of which address customers and markets that were previously outside the scope of our products 
we anticipate introducing additional new products in coming quarters 
we believe these products will increase our addressable opportunities and  accordingly  improve our prospects for gaining market share and sales growth 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in our cost of products and gross margins are primarily related to product mix  manufacturing volumes and pricing 
our gross margins for the year reflect increased manufacturing volumes and an improved sales mix of higher margin p digital products 
as a consequence of higher manufacturing volumes  we more fully utilized and absorbed our base of manufacturing and support expenses  favorably impacting product unit costs and gross margins 
these improvements were partially offset by competitive pricing pressures 
we continue to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
we also regularly consider manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  speed and to reduce our product costs 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
increased sales volumes and p product sales combined with the introduction of planned new products  we believe  should result in cost improvements and efficiencies 
we anticipate that competitive pricing pressures will continue in the future  however  the extent of their impact on gross margins is uncertain 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  product development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters expenses and non cash share based employee compensation expense 
for  sg a expenses declined million to approximately million or of sales compared with approximately million or of sales for the prior year 
engineering and product development expenses in declined by  compared with last year 
the completion of several digital development initiatives and the related new product introductions enabled us to reduce the associated engineering costs compared with additional new products in our kng line are in the development process  and are planned for introduction in however  we do not anticipate a significant increase in expenses related to this development 
marketing and selling expenses in decreased by approximately  compared with last year 
during the second half of and the first quarter  we reduced selling expenses and payroll in response to sluggish sales and an uncertain forecast 
we maintained this lower expense structure during the remainder of the year 
in  we invested in selling and marketing initiatives focused on raising the profile of our new kng product line  and expanding into new markets and customers 
general and administrative expenses in decreased by approximately  compared with last year primarily due to reductions in professional fees and headquarters expenses 
operating income we reported operating income of approximately million for  compared with an operating loss of approximately million last year 
during  total sales increased from the previous year and the mix of product sales was more favorable  with a larger volume of p digital sales in additionally  operating expenses declined approximately million in compared with these factors combined to increase operating income 
interest income expense  net for  we incurred approximately  in net interest expense compared with net interest income of approximately  for the prior year 
we earn interest income on our cash balances and incur interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
the decline in net interest income and increase in interest expense is derived from our lower cash position in the first half of the year  and lower interest rates 
also  we incurred interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the first two quarters in in we did not borrow 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december  the interest rate on such revolving credit facility as of december  was 
this rate is variable based on the prime rate plus basis points subject to a reduction of basis points anytime our quarterly net income is greater than million 
income taxes benefits we recorded net income tax expense of approximately million for compared with an income tax benefit of million last year 
our income tax expenses and benefits are largely non cash as a result of the deferred tax asset related primarily to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million compared with million at the start of the year 
these assets are primarily composed of net operating loss carry forwards nols  which are available to offset federal and state taxable income 
the nols expire starting in through in order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize our nols prior to their expiration 
asc topic  income taxes  requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
we have evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
from our evaluation we have concluded that based on the weight of available evidence we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets recorded at december  accordingly  no valuation allowance has been established 
we cannot presently estimate what  if any  changes to the valuation of our deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in the future 
if we incur future losses  it may be necessary to record a valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets recorded as of december  accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by asc topic income taxes  as modified by fin deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that impairment of tax assets are more likely than not 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates o f future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in our primary markets of government and public safety and commercial  business and industrial declined in compared with the prior year 
net sales for totaled million compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
sales of p digital products in were million  or of total sales  compared with million or of sales for purchases by our largest legacy customers suffered throughout as these federal agencies struggled with funding and contract issues which impacted both our total sales and p digital sales 
additionally  the initial products in our new kng line of p digital radios were introduced later in the year which limited our effectiveness in penetrating and realizing sales to agencies or other organizations that have not previously been customers 
in our new kng line  we completed and introduced p digital products operating in vhf  uhf  and mhz 
we have never before had p digital uhf or mhz products in our portfolio 
we believe these products have expanded our addressable market and enhanced our future prospects for sales growth 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in changes in our cost of products are primarily related to the mix of products sold and manufacturing volumes 
in  sales of higher margin products declined from the previous year 
also  due to lower total sales  our manufacturing volumes decreased 
accordingly  we did not fully utilize and absorb our base of manufacturing expenses 
the combination of these factors increased overall product costs and decreased gross margins 
in response to these conditions  during we took steps to adjust operations and reduce related expenses 
we continued to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
furthermore  we evaluated contract manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  responsiveness  and cost 
the contract manufacturing relationships in place for continued in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist of sales  marketing  commissions  engineering  product development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters expenses and non cash share based employee compensation expenses 
for  sg a expenses totaled approximately million or of sales compared with approximately million or or sales 
engineering and product development expenses in increased by approximately million  or of sales  to million compared with million in this increase was entirely driven by the application of additional variable engineering resources to speed the completion and introduction of products of our new line of p digital radios 
during and the first quarter of  we completed and introduced new p digital radios operating in the vhf  uhf  and mhz frequencies 
the models operating in uhf and mhz frequencies are particularly important because such products have never before been part of our product line  and therefore we have not previously been able to address opportunities in these portions of the market 
we believe these products expand our addressable market and should be a source of sales growth in the future 
additional new products were introduced in selling and marketing expenses decreased by approximately  or of sales  to million compared with million for the previous year 
this decline was primarily due to reduced commissions from lower sales 
also  responding to lower sales  we reduced sales and marketing payroll and related expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  or of sales  to million compared with million for the previous year 
this was primarily attributed to reductions in professional fees and headquarters expenses 
operating income we reported an operating loss of approximately million for  compared with operating income of million the previous year 
during  total sales decreased and the mix of product sales was less favorable  with the decline in sales of higher margin p digital products  compared with last year 
these factors combined to adversely impact operating income 
interest income  net for  we earned approximately  in net interest income compared to  for the prior year 
we earn interest income on our cash balances and incur interest expense on borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
the decline in net interest income is derived from our lower cash position  which resulted primarily from our operating loss in as well as the payment in the fourth quarter of a cash dividend of per share of common stock 
also  interest rates declined in compared with the previous year 
we had million outstanding under the revolving line of credit as of december  the interest rate on such revolving line of credit is variable based on the prime rate plus basis points 
income taxes  benefits income tax benefit for totaled approximately million compared with tax expense of million for the prior year 
the benefit and expense for each year is largely non cash as a result of our deferred tax asset related primarily to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   our deferred tax asset totaled approximately million 
this asset was primarily composed of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
these nols were available for federal and state purposes  with expiration dates starting in in order to fully realize the net deferred tax asset  sufficient taxable income was required in future years prior to the expiration of our nols 
asc topic  income tax  requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax asset 
the recognition of the net deferred tax asset and related tax benefit was based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  our estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  our current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as recent operating results and certain tax planning strategies 
we evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax asset 
from our evaluation we concluded that based on the weight of available evidence we were more likely than not to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets recorded at december  inflation and changing prices inflation and changing prices for the years ended december   and did not have a material impact on our operations 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  compared with net cash used in operating activities of approximately million last year 
cash generated from operating activities in was primarily the result of net income totaling approximately million compared with a net loss of approximately million last year  as well as a million decrease in net inventories compared with an increase of million last year 
net inventories declined during the period due to increased sales of in stock products 
as a result of sales growth  accounts receivable increased by approximately million during the year  compared with a decrease of million last year deferred tax assets for decreased by million due to utilization of net operating losses to cover current year pretax income 
last year deferred tax assets increased by approximately million as a result of the tax benefit associated with our pretax loss 
depreciation and amortization totaled approximately  for  compared with  last year 
cash used in investing activities was primarily to fund the acquisition of assets pertaining to the development of our new digital products 
during we incurred million for capitalized software compared with million for the prior year 
capital expenditures for were approximately  compared with approximately  for we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded through our existing cash balance and operating cash flow 
cash used in financing activities totaled million for  representing repayment of the entire principal balance outstanding on our revolving line of credit 
last year  we generated approximately  from the issuance of common stock 
we have a secured revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank svb 
the svb facility provides borrowing availability of up to million and is governed by a loan and security agreement entered into between us and svb 
the facility is available on a revolving basis during the period that commenced on october  and ending on october  under the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement for the facility  advances are generally subject to customary borrowing conditions  including the accuracy of representations and warranties  compliance with financial maintenance and restrictive covenants and the absence of events of default 
for additional information about the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement  reference is made to note debt of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
advances under the facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the prime rate  in effect from time to time  plus basis points  subject to a reduction of basis points anytime our quarterly net income is greater than million 
under the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement for the facility  advances may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty 
under the terms and conditions of the loan and security agreement for the facility  our obligations are secured by substantially all of our assets  principally accounts receivable and inventory 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the loan and security agreement as of the date of this report 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the facility and approximately million of borrowing availability 
at december   our cash balance was approximately million 
we believe these funds combined with anticipated cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our secured revolving credit facility with svb are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the next twelve months 
although we do not anticipate needing additional capital in the near term  the constrained credit markets and adverse economic conditions may limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital  if needed  on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  we face a number of other risks related to industry  national and worldwide economic conditions that may impact our business  liquidity and financial condition 
for a description of these risks  see item a 
risk factors we face a number of risks related to the current economic conditions

recent accounting pronouncements in april  fasb provided additional guidance for estimating fair value when the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased  and also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
this guidance amended the other than temporary impairment guidance in us generally accepted accounting principles for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements 
an impairment is now considered to be other than temporary if an entity i intends to sell the security  ii more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost  or iii does not expect to recover the security s entire amortized cost basis  even if there is no intent to sell the security 
in assessing the expectation of recove ry  companies are required to make an assessment of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected 
if this assessment yields an amount less than the amortized cost basis of the security  even if the entity has the intent  and more likely than not  the ability to hold the securities  a credit loss is deemed to exist  which is considered an other than temporary impairment 
the amount of an other than temporary impairment attributable to credit losses is recognized in earnings  while the amount of an other than temporary impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the company consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asc  financial instruments transition and open effective date information asc  which amends asc  financial instruments  and asc  interim financial reporting  to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual reporting periods

asc also requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a vie operates as designed when determining whether it has power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
asc also requires ongoing assessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  requires enhanced disclosures and eliminates the scope exclusion for qualifying special purpose entities 
asc is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company s adoption of asc is not expected to have an impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu  which provides additional guidance under the fair value measurements and disclosures topic  asc application to liabilities 
the guidance clarifies that the quoted price for the liability when traded as an asset in an active market is a level measurement  when no adjustment to the quoted price is required

the amendments align the accounting for these revenue transaction types with the amendments under asu the guidance provided within asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june  and allows for either prospective or retrospective application  with early adoption permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected for discussion our revenue recognition process and our more subjective accounting estimation processes 
these processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of relm 
the processes for determining the allowance for collection of trade receivables  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  software development and income taxes  involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on relm s operations and financial position 
revenue sales revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped by the company or delivered to the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery 
however  sales to the federal government are recognized when the products are delivered 
we periodically review our revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with asc topic revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  on gross trade receivables of approximately million as of december  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of december  because the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of december  cannot be known with certainty as of this report s date  we rely on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have typically been infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales 
accordingly  we have maintained a general allowance up to approximately of the gross trade receivables balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but turn out to have such an inability 
currently  our general allowance on trade receivables is approximately of gross receivables 
as revenues and total receivables increase  the allowance balance may also increase 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify those accounts that are more likely than not to have collection problems 
we may reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
excess and obsolete inventory the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory was approximately million at december  as compared to approximately million at december  the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
because the amount of inventory that we will actually recoup through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time  we rely on past sales experience  future sales forecasts  and our strategic business plans 
generally  in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify inventory as having been used or unused during the past year and establish a reserve based upon several factors  including  but not limited to  business forecasts  inventory quantities and historic usage profile 
supplemental to the aforementioned analysis  specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management 
based on the review  considering business levels  future prospects  new products and technology changes  the valuation of specific inventory items may be adjusted to reflect an accurate valuation  in the business judgment of management 
management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost 
for all such items  the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price 
software development we account for the costs of software within its products in accordance with asc topic costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed  under which certain software costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products 
we determine technological feasibility to be established upon the internal release of a detailed program design as specified by topic upon the general release of the product to customers  development costs for that product are amortized over periods not exceeding five years  based on current and future revenue of the product 
net capitalized software costs totaled approximately million as of december  income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by asc topic  income taxes  as modified by asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on the our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that impairment of tax assets are more likely than not 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among othe r things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future
