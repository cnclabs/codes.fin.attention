item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview drilling capital development and operating activities update 
delivery commitment at june   we had no delivery commitments with our purchasers and currently have no delivery commitments 
title mortgages our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty interests  liens incident to operating agreements  liens for current taxes and other burdens  including other mineral encumbrances and restrictions as well as mortgage liens in accordance with our credit agreements 
we do not believe that any of these burdens materially interferes with the use of our properties in the operation of our business 
see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding the mortgages that we have granted under the credit agreements on all of our oil and natural gas properties 
we believe that we have generally satisfactory title to or rights in all of our producing properties 
when we make acquisitions  we make title investigations  but may not receive title opinions of local counsel until we commence drilling operations 
we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our other assets 
although title to our properties is subject to encumbrances in certain cases  we believe that none of these burdens will materially detract from the value of our properties or from our interest therein or will materially interfere with our use of them in the operation of our business 
acquisitions we pursue and evaluate acquisition opportunities including opportunities to acquire oil and natural gas properties and related assets or entities owning oil and natural gas properties or related assets  and opportunities to engage in mergers  consolidations or other business combinations with entities owning oil and natural gas properties or related assets and at any given time may be in various stages of evaluating such opportunities 
such stages include internal financial and oil and natural gas property analysis  preliminary due diligence  the submission of an indication of interest  preliminary negotiations and negotiation of a letter of intent or negotiation of a definitive agreement 
due to our current liquidity constraints  it is unlikely that we will make any acquisitions of oil and gas properties and related assets or entities owning such assets for the foreseeable future 
competition we face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business  including in the acquisition of producing properties and oil and natural gas leases  and in obtaining goods  services and labor 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do 
factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available funds  available information about the property and our standards established for minimum projected return on investment 
customers we sell our crude oil and natural gas production to multiple independent purchasers pursuant to contracts generally terminable by either party upon thirty days prior written notice to the other party 
during the year ended june   
table of contents or more of our total revenues were attributable to four customers accounting for valero marketing supply co  coffeyville resources refinery and marketing  llc  plains marketing  lp  and dcp midstream  lp of total operating revenue  respectively 
on august   we entered into a new gas purchase contract the dcp agreement with dcp midstream  lp dcp effective on july   which supersedes the previous gas purchase contract  as amended  with dcp 
previously  all of our panhandle properties leases and wells were dedicated to dcp and eagle rock field services  lp eagle rock 
the new dcp agreement dedicates all of our panhandle properties leases and wells to dcp 
subject to certain conditions  the term of the dcp agreement runs until april  and  unless terminated upon days prior notice  continues thereafter on a year to year basis 
pursuant to the terms of the dcp agreement  we will be paid on a sliding scale based upon the volume of ngls and natural gas it sells per each delivery point 
we will continue to sell  on a month to month basis  natural gas and ngls in the texas panhandle to eagle rock until such time as any given well is added to new delivery points on the dcp pipeline 
as of june   we had redirected approximately of the natural gas production previously delivered to eagle rock to dcp 
revenue enhancements under the dcp agreement should offset the effect of volumes sold to eagle rock 
title to the produced commodities transfers to the purchaser at the time the purchaser collects or receives such commodities 
prices for such production are defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on certain publicly available indices 
the purchasers of such production have historically made payment for crude oil and natural gas purchases within thirty five days of the end of each production month 
we periodically review the difference between the dates of production and the dates we collect payment for such production to ensure that receivables from those purchasers are collectible 
the point of sale for our oil and natural gas production is at our applicable field gathering systems 
in the event that one or more of these significant purchasers ceases doing business with us  we believe that there are potential alternative purchasers with whom we could establish new relationships and that those relationships would result in the replacement of one or more lost purchasers 
we would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  the loss of a single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our crude oil and natural gas production  which could negatively impact the prices we receive 
governmental regulation our operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulation affecting the oil and natural gas industry 
many departments and agencies  both federal and state  are authorized by statute to issue  and have issued  rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual participants 
the failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and  consequently  affects our profitability 
we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these regulations than are our competitors 
the production of crude oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of state and federal statutes  rules  orders and regulations 
state and federal statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
texas  oklahoma and new mexico  the states in which we own and operate properties  have regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  the spacing of wells  and the plugging and abandonment of wells and removal of related production equipment 
texas  oklahoma and new mexico also restrict production to the market demand for crude oil and natural gas 
these regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells  limit the number of wells  or limit the locations at which we can conduct drilling operations 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to production and sales of crude oil  natural gas and gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
transportation and sale of natural gas our natural gas sales were approximately of our total sales during the year ended june  the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including transportation rates and various other matters  by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic natural gas were terminated on january   and none of our natural gas sales prices are currently subject to ferc regulation 
we cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on our natural gas operations 
insurance our insurance policies currently provide for  general liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage including pollution  underground resources  blow out and cratering 
in addition  we have  coverage for 
table of contents our contractual obligations to our service contractors using their equipment downhole if it is damaged as a result of a blow out 
we have an owned hired and non owned commercial automobile liability limit of  we also have secured  umbrella coverage in excess of the general liability and automobile liability 
additionally  we have a  policy for control of well  redrill  and pollution on drilling wells and a  policy for control of well  redrill and pollution on producing wells 
environmental regulations our operations are subject to numerous stringent and complex laws and regulations at the federal  state and local levels governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to human health and environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may  among other things  require acquisition of a permit before drilling or development commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentrations of various materials that can be released into the environment in connection with development and production activities  and limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities in certain ecologically sensitive and other protected areas 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with permits may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of remedial requirements and the imposition of injunctions to force future compliance 
our business and prospects could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that prohibits or restricts our development and production activities or imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
we conduct our development and production activities to comply with all applicable environmental regulations  permits and lease conditions  and we monitor subcontractors for environmental compliance 
while we believe our operations conform to those conditions  we remain at risk for inadvertent noncompliance  conditions beyond our control and undetected conditions resulting from activities of prior owners or operators of properties in which we own interests 
occupational safety regulation we are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations intended to promote occupational health and safety 
although all of our wells are drilled by independent subcontractors under our footage or day rate drilling contracts  we have adopted environmental and safety policies and procedures designed to protect the safety of our own supervisory staff and to monitor all subcontracted operations for compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and lease conditions  including environmental and safety compliance 
this program includes regular field inspections of our drill sites and producing wells by members of our operations staff and internal assessments of our compliance procedures 
we consider the cost of compliance a manageable and necessary part of our business 
federal  state or native american leases our operations on federal  state or native american oil and natural gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  minerals management service and other agencies 
employees we and our wholly owned subsidiaries have employees as of september  all of our employees are full time employees 
none of our employees are represented by a union 
we have never experienced an interruption in operations from any kind of labor dispute  and we consider the working relationships among the members of our staff to be generally good 
principal executive offices our principal executive offices are located at the burnett plaza  cherry street  suite  fort worth  tx our principal executive offices consist of  square feet and are subject to a lease that expires on june see note to our consolidated financial statements regarding our lease payments now and in the future

primary recovery 
the period of production in which oil moves from its reservoir through the wellbore under naturally occurring reservoir pressure 
producing well or productive well 
a well that is capable of producing oil or natural gas in economic quantities 

table of contents pdp or proved developed producing reserves 
the oil and natural gas reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and natural gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery should be included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
pdnp or proved developed non producing reserves 
the oil and natural gas reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods  but are not currently producing 
pore volume injection or pvi means the injection of water or surfactants  polymers and other additives into the void space of a producing formation 
the amount of a pore volume injection or pvi is the amount of void space of a producing formation that has been displaced with water or surfactants  polymers and other additives 
proved reserves 
the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
pud or proved undeveloped reserves 
the oil and natural gas reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units can be claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
under no circumstances should estimates for proved undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual tests in the area and in the same reservoir 
royalty interest 
an interest in an oil and natural gas property entitling the owner to a share of oil and natural gas production free of production costs 
secondary recovery 
the recovery of oil and natural gas through the injection of liquids or gases into the reservoir  supplementing its natural energy 
secondary recovery methods are often applied when production slows due to depletion of the natural pressure 
standardized measure 
under the standardized measure  future cash flows are estimated by applying year end prices  adjusted for fixed and determinable changes  to the estimated future production of year end proved reserves 
future cash inflows are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on period end costs to determine pretax cash inflows 
future income taxes are computed by applying the statutory tax rate to the excess inflows over a company s tax basis in the associated properties 
tax credits  net operating loss carryforwards and permanent differences also are considered in the future tax calculation 
future net cash inflows after income taxes are discounted using a annual discount rate to arrive at the standardized measure 
surfactant polymer flooding and alkaline surfactant polymer asp flooding 
enhanced oil recovery techniques that can be employed to recover additional oil over and above primary and secondary recovery methods 
low concentrations of surfactants  polymers and other additives that are added to the waterflood operations already in place to clean stubborn or hard to reach oil from the reservoir 
tertiary recovery 
the use of improved recovery methods that not only restores formation pressure but also improves oil displacement or fluid flow in the reservoir and removes additional oil after secondary recovery 
us the united states of america 
waterflooding 
a secondary recovery operation in which water is injected into the producing formation in order to maintain reservoir pressure and sweep oil into the producing wells 
working interest 
the operating interest not necessarily as operator that gives the owner the right to drill  produce and conduct operating activities on the property and a share of production  subject to all royalties  overriding royalties and other burdens  and to all exploration  development and operational costs including all risks in connection therewith 

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
our business involves a high degree of risk 
investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below 
each of the following risks may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these risks may cause the market price of our common stock to decline  which may cause you to lose all or a part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
risks related to our industry crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile 
a substantial or sustained decline in prices could adversely affect our financial position  financial results  cash flows and access to capital 
our revenues and operating results depend primarily upon the prices we receive for the crude oil and natural gas we produce and sell 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
historically  the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas are based upon factors that are beyond our control  including worldwide and domestic demands and supplies of oil and natural gas  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the availability of pipeline capacity  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil producing regions  and the overall economic environment 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future crude oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
declines in crude oil and natural gas prices would not only reduce revenue  but could reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and  as a result  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and reserves 
government regulation may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
oil and natural gas operations are subject to various and numerous federal  state and local government regulations  which may be changed from time to time 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations  spacing of wells  injection of substances  unitization and pooling of properties and taxation 
from time to time  regulatory agencies have imposed price controls and limitations on production by restricting the rate of flow of oil and natural gas wells below actual production capacity in order to conserve supplies of oil and natural gas 
certain federal  state and local laws and regulations applicable to the development  production  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of oil and natural gas  by products thereof and other substances and materials produced or used in connection with oil and natural gas operations  exist for the purpose of protecting the human health and the environment 
the transportation and storage of refined products include the risk that refined products and other hydrocarbons may be suddenly or gradually released into the environment  potentially causing substantial expenditures for a response action  significant government penalties  liability to government agencies and private parties for natural resources damages  personal injury  or property damages and significant business interruption 
we own or lease a number of properties that have been used to store or distribute refined and unrefined products for many years 
many of these properties have also been operated by third parties whose handling  disposal  or release of hydrocarbons and other wastes were not under our control 
as a result  we may incur substantial expenditures and or liabilities to third parties or governmental entities which could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive  and we may not be able to raise the capital needed to conduct our operations as planned or to make strategic acquisitions 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition of  exploration for and development of  crude oil and natural gas reserves 
due to our current liquidity constraints  it is unlikely that we will make any acquisitions of oil and gas properties and related assets or entities owning such assets for the foreseeable future 
historically  we have financed capital expenditures with cash generated by operations  proceeds from bank borrowings and sales of equity securities 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
any one of these variables can materially affect our ability to access the capital markets 
if our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to fund future development projects 
we may  from time to time  seek additional financing  either in the form of bank borrowings  public or private sales of debt or equity securities or other forms of financing  or consider selling non core assets to raise additional operating capital 
however  we may not be able to obtain additional financing or sell non core assets upon terms acceptable to us 
any prolonged  substantial reduction in the demand for oil and gas  or distribution problems in meeting this demand  could adversely affect our business 
our success is materially dependent upon the demand for oil and gas 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the demand for and supply of oil and gas  the availability of alternative energy sources  the proximity of reserves to  and the capacity of  oil and gas gathering systems  pipelines or trucking and terminal facilities 
we may also have to shut in some of our wells temporarily due to a lack of market or adverse weather conditions 
if the demand for oil and gas diminishes  our financial results would be negatively impacted 
in addition  there are limitations related to the methods of transportation for our production 
substantially all of our oil and gas production is transported by pipelines and trucks owned by third parties 
the inability or unwillingness of these parties to provide transportation services to us for a reasonable fee could result in us having to find transportation alternatives  increased transportation costs or involuntary curtailment of a significant portion of our oil and gas production  any of which could have a negative impact on its results of operation and cash flows 
environmental liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
the oil and gas business is subject to environmental hazards  such as oil spills  gas leaks and ruptures and discharges of petroleum products and hazardous substances  and historic disposal activities 
these environmental hazards could expose us to material liabilities for property damages  personal injuries or other environmental harm  including costs of investigating and remediating contaminated properties 
a variety of stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the environmental aspects of our business and impose strict requirements for  among other things well drilling or workover  operation and abandonment  waste management  land reclamation  financial assurance under the oil pollution act of  and controlling air  water and waste emissions 
any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative  civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities 
additionally  our compliance with these laws may  from time to time  result in increased costs of 
table of contents production  development or exploration  or decreased production  and may affect our costs of acquisitions 
our liability for environmental hazards includes those created either by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease or by acquired companies prior to the date we acquire them 
we maintain insurance against some  but not all  of the risks described above 
our insurance policies currently provide for  general liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage including pollution  underground resources  blow out and cratering 
in addition  we have  coverage for our contractual obligations to our service contractors using their equipment downhole if it is damaged as a result of a blow out 
we have an owned hired and non owned commercial automobile liability limit of  we also have secured  umbrella coverage in excess of the general liability and automobile liability 
there is a  policy for control of well  redrill  and pollution on drilling wells and a  policy for control of well  redrill and pollution on producing wells 
our insurance may not be adequate to cover casualty losses or liabilities 
also  in the future  we may not be able to obtain insurance at premium levels that justify its purchase 
we do not insure against the loss of oil or natural gas reserves as a result of operating hazards  insure against business interruption or insure our field production equipment against loss 
losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks  or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  pollution and similar environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
president obama s proposed budget of the us government  fiscal year  includes proposed legislation that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to united states tax laws  including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether any such changes will be enacted or how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 
climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 
on december   the us environmental protection agency epa officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases ghg present an endangerment to human health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings by the epa allow the agency to proceed with the adoption and implementation of regulations that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
in late september  the epa had proposed two sets of regulations in anticipation of finalizing its findings that would require a reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases from motor vehicles and that could also lead to the imposition of greenhouse gas emission limitations in clean air act permits for certain stationary sources 
in addition  on september   the epa issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources in the united states beginning in for emissions occurring in in march  the epa announced a proposed rulemaking that would expand its final rule on reporting of ghg emissions to include owners and operators of onshore oil and natural gas production facilities 
if the proposed rule is finalized in its current form  reporting of ghg emissions from such facilities would be required on an annual basis beginning in for emissions occurring in the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 
federal and state governments are considering enacting new legislation and promulgating new regulations governing or restricting the emission of greenhouse gases 
the epa has already made findings and issued proposed regulations that could lead to the imposition of restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and certain stationary sources and that could require us to establish and report an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions 
in addition  the us congress has been considering various bills that would establish an economy wide cap and trade program to reduce us emissions of 
table of contents greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide and methane 
such a program  if enacted  could require phased reductions in greenhouse gas emissions over several or many years as could the issuance of a declining number of tradable allowances to sources that emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere 
legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we sell 
the potential increase in our operating costs could include new or increased costs to obtain permits  operate and maintain our equipment and facilities  install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities  acquire allowances to authorize our greenhouse gas emissions  pay taxes related to our greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program 
moreover  incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources could reduce demand for oil and natural gas 
derivatives regulation included in current financial reform legislation could impede our ability to manage business and financial risks by restricting our use of derivative instruments as hedges against fluctuating commodity prices 
the united states congress recently adopted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  which contains comprehensive financial reform legislation that establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities  such as the company  that participate in that market 
the new legislation was signed into law by the president on july  and requires the commodity futures trading commission the cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new legislation within days from the date of enactment 
the cftc has also proposed regulations to set position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets  although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the cftc will adopt those rules or include comparable provisions in its rulemaking under the new legislation 
the financial reform legislation contains significant derivatives regulation  including provisions requiring certain transactions to be cleared on exchanges and containing a requirement to post cash collateral commonly referred to as margin for such transactions as well as certain clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with our derivative activities 
the act provides for a potential exception from these clearing and cash collateral requirements for commercial end users and it includes a number of defined terms that will be used in determining how this exception applies to particular derivative transactions and to the parties to those transactions 
however  we do not know the definitions that the cftc will actually promulgate nor how these definitions will apply to us 
the financial reform legislation may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to a separate entity  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty 
depending on the rules and definitions adopted by the cftc  we could be required to post collateral with our dealer counterparties for our commodities hedging transactions 
the new legislation and any new regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity  thereby reducing our ability to use cash for investment or other corporate purposes  or would require us to increase our level of debt  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the legislation and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
finally  the legislation was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
in addition  a requirement for our counterparties to post collateral would likely result in additional costs being passed on to us  thereby decreasing the effectiveness of our hedges and our profitability 
any of these consequences could have a material  adverse effect on us  our financial condition  and our results of operations 
federal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays 
congress is currently considering legislation to amend the federal safe drinking water act to require the disclosure of chemicals used by the oil and gas industry in the hydraulic fracturing process 
hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into rock formations to stimulate natural gas production 
sponsors of bills currently pending before the senate and house of representatives have asserted that chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies 
the proposed legislation would require the reporting and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process  which could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater 
these bills  if adopted  could establish an additional level of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs and could result in additional regulatory burdens that could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business 
in addition  
table of contents in march  the epa announced its intention to conduct a comprehensive research study on the potential adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
thus  even if the pending bills are not adopted  the epa study  depending on its results  could spur further initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa 
risks related to our business our auditors have issued a going concern audit opinion 
our consolidated financial statements as of june  have been prepared on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern 
our independent accountants have issued a report dated september  stating that our significant losses from operations and net capital deficiency raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
investors in our securities should review carefully the report of hein associates llp 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern 
we have no borrowing capacity under our credit agreements  and unless we are able to successfully execute one of our strategic alternatives  restructure our existing indebtedness  obtain further waivers or forbearance from our existing lenders or otherwise raise significant capital  it is unlikely that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due and to continue as a going concern 
we have sustained recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
over the periods presented in the accompanying financial statements  our growth has been funded through a combination of equity financings  borrowings under our credit agreements  the sale of assets and cash flows from operating activities 
as of june   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents available to fund operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
on july   we terminated our announced merger with resaca that had been initiated pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated september  on july  we announced the engagement of canaccord genuity and global hunter securities to assist our board in a review of strategic alternatives  with a goal of maximizing economic value for our shareholders 
the strategic alternatives we are considering include the sale of the company  the sale of some or all of our existing oil and gas properties and assets  and potential business combinations 
we currently have limited access to capital 
on august   we finalized consent and forbearance agreements with the lenders under our credit agreements that waived covenant compliance issues for the period ended june  and potential covenant compliance issues for the period ending september   set certain deadlines for the execution of our strategic alternatives process and allowed us to sell certain natural gas commodity derivative contracts for cash proceeds of million  which was intended to provide cano sufficient liquidity to complete our strategic alternatives process 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we currently have no available borrowing capacity under our senior and subordinated credit agreements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
as a result of losses incurred and our current negative working capital  there is no assurance that the carrying amounts of assets will be realized or that liabilities will be settled for the amounts recorded 
the ability of the company to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon the outcome of the strategic alternatives review 
unless we are able to successfully execute one of our strategic alternatives  restructure our existing indebtedness  obtain further waivers or forbearance from our existing lenders or otherwise raise significant additional capital  it is unlikely that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due and to continue as a going concern 
we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to execute one of our strategic alternatives  restructure our existing indebtedness  obtain further waivers or forbearance from our existing lenders or otherwise raise significant additional capital 
we are subject to potential early repayments as well as restrictions pursuant to the terms of our series d convertible preferred stock which may adversely impact our operations 
pursuant to the terms of our series d convertible preferred stock the preferred stock  if a triggering event occurs  the holders of our preferred stock will have the right to require us to redeem their preferred stock at a price of at least of the  per share stated value of the preferred stock plus accrued dividends 
triggering events include the following our common stock is suspended from trading or fails to be listed on the amex  the new york stock exchange  
table of contents the nasdaq global select market  the nasdaq global market or the nasdaq capital market  we fail to convert and do not cure this failure within business days after the conversion date or give notice of our intention not to comply with a request for conversion  we fail to pay for at least business days any amount when due pursuant to the terms of the preferred stock or any documents related to the sale and registration rights of the preferred stock  common stock and warrants  we take certain actions  or third parties take certain actions  with regard to bankruptcy  we default on any indebtedness which default is not waived and the applicable grace period has expired  or we breach any representation  warranty  covenant or other term or condition of any document relating to the sale and registration rights relating to the preferred stock  the common stock and the warrants  which  to the extent such breach is curable  such breach is not cured within business days 
there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay the amounts due under our preferred stock upon the occurrence of a triggering event 
in addition  we cannot issue any preferred stock that is senior or on par with the preferred stock with regard to dividends or liquidation without the approval of holders of a majority of the preferred stock 
if we file for bankruptcy protection  holders of our common stock and preferred stock may be severely diluted or eliminated entirely in connection with a bankruptcy filing or restructuring transaction 
if we are unable to successfully execute one of our strategic alternatives  restructure our existing indebtedness  obtain further waivers or forbearance from our existing lenders or otherwise raise significant additional capital  it is unlikely that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due and to continue as a going concern 
as a result  we will likely file for bankruptcy or seek similar protection 
moreover  it is possible that our creditors may seek to initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings against us or against one or more of our subsidiaries  which would force us to make defensive voluntary filing s of our own 
in addition  if we restructure our debt or file for bankruptcy protection  it is very likely that our common stock and preferred stock will be severely diluted if not eliminated entirely 
our limited history makes an evaluation of us and our future difficult and profits are not assured 
in view of our limited history in the oil and natural gas business  you may have difficulty in evaluating us and our business and prospects 
since may  we have acquired rights in oil and natural gas properties and undertaken certain exploitation activities 
we are in the early stages of two waterfloods and one asp project 
you must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies similar to ourselves 
generally  for our business plan to succeed  we must successfully undertake the following activities develop our oil and natural gas properties  including the successful application of eor technologies  to the point at which oil and natural gas are being produced in commercially viable quantities  contract with third parties regarding services necessary to develop our oil and natural gas properties  contract with transporters and purchasers of our oil and natural gas production  maintain access to funds to pursue our capital intensive business plan  comply with all applicable laws and regulations  implement and successfully execute our business strategy  find and acquire rights in strategic oil and natural gas properties  respond to competitive developments and market changes  and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in undertaking such activities 
our failure to successfully undertake most of the activities described above could materially and adversely affect our business  prospects  financial 
table of contents condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that sales of our oil and natural gas production will be able to sustain profitability in any future period 
we are subject to many restrictions imposed by our lenders under our credit agreements and consent and forbearance agreements which may adversely impact our future operations 
we currently have limited access to capital 
on august   we finalized consent and forbearance agreements with the lenders under our credit agreements that waived potential covenant compliance issues for the periods ending june  and september   set certain deadlines for the execution of our strategic alternatives process and allowed us to sell certain natural gas commodity derivative contracts for cash proceeds of million  which was intended to provide cano sufficient liquidity to complete its strategic alternatives process 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we currently have no available borrowing capacity under our senior and subordinated credit agreements 
if we cannot obtain sufficient capital when needed  we will not be able to continue with our business strategy 
our business strategy includes developing and acquiring interests in mature oil fields with established primary and or secondary reserves that may possess significant remaining upside exploitation potential by implementing various secondary and or tertiary eor techniques 
as we continue our business plan  we may require additional capital to finance acquisitions as well as to conduct our eor operations 
due to our current liquidity constraints  it is unlikely that we will make any acquisitions of oil and gas properties and related assets or entities owning such assets for the foreseeable future 
additionally  in the future  we may not be able to obtain financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed  which could adversely affect our operating results and prospects 
if we cannot raise the capital required to implement our business strategy  we may be required to curtail operations or develop a different strategy  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
further  any debt financing must be repaid and redeemable preferred stock must be redeemed regardless of whether or not we generate profits or cash flows from our business activities 
the actual quantities and present value of our proved reserves may be lower than we have estimated 
this annual report contains estimates of our proved reserves 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
the process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from these estimates and vary over time 
such variations may be significant and could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our proved reserves 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of drilling  results of secondary and tertiary recovery applications  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
approximately of our total proved reserves as of june  consisted of undeveloped reserves  and those reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced 
approximately of our total proved reserves as of june  were undeveloped 
while we plan to develop and produce all of our proved reserves  these reserves may not ultimately be developed or produced 
furthermore  not all of our undeveloped or developed non producing reserves may be ultimately produced in the time periods we have planned  nor at the costs we have budgeted  or at all 
as of june   estimated development costs for our pdnp and pud reserves were approximately million and million  respectively  through we may not achieve the production growth we anticipate from our properties or properties we acquire 
our operational strategy is to implement waterflood and eor techniques upon our existing properties 
the performance of waterflood and eor techniques is often difficult to predict and takes an extended period of time from first investment until actual production 
additionally  we may not achieve the anticipated production growth from properties we own or acquire in the future 
acquisitions may prove to be worth less than we paid because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities 
our historical growth has been due in part to acquisitions of exploration and production companies  producing properties and undeveloped leaseholds 
successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors  including estimates of recoverable reserves  exploration potential  recovery applicability from waterflood and eor techniques  future oil and natural gas prices  operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
in connection with our assessments  we perform reviews of acquired properties which we believe are generally consistent with industry practices 
however  such reviews will not reveal all existing or potential 
table of contents problems 
in addition  these reviews may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
additionally  we do not inspect every well or property 
even when we inspect a well or property  we do not always discover structural  subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise 
we are generally not entitled to contractual indemnification for pre closing liabilities  including environmental liabilities 
normally  we acquire interests in properties on an as is basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties 
as a result of these factors  we may not be able to acquire oil and natural gas properties that contain economically recoverable reserves 
additionally  significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business depending upon the character of the acquired properties  which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or be in different geographic locations than our existing properties 
it is our current intention to continue focusing on acquiring properties located in onshore united states 
to the extent that we acquire properties substantially different from the properties in our primary operating regions or acquire properties that require different technical expertise  we may not be able to realize the economic benefits of these acquisitions 
exploration and development drilling and the application of waterflooding and eor techniques may not result in commercially productive reserves 
the new wells we drill or participate in  whether undertaken in primary drilling or utilizing waterflood or eor techniques may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment 
the engineering data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively  prior to beginning a project  that crude oil or natural gas is present in the reservoir or that those reserves can be produced economically 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a project 
our efforts will be unprofitable if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough reserves to generate an economic return 
further  our drilling and other operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including but not limited to unexpected drilling conditions  title and permitting problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices  adverse weather conditions  and increases in the costs of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  chemicals  drilling rigs and equipment 
certain of our current development and exploration waterflood or eor techniques where no proved waterflood or eor reserves have previously been recorded activities may not be successful and  if unsuccessful  this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
while all crude oil and natural gas activities  whether developmental or exploratory  involve these risks  exploratory activities involve greater risks of failure to find and produce commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas 
the departure of key management and personnel could adversely affect our ability to run our business 
our future success is dependent on the personal efforts  performance and abilities of key management  including s 
jeffrey johnson  our chairman and chief executive officer  benjamin daitch  senior vice president and chief financial officer  michael j 
ricketts  vice president and principal accounting officer  and phillip feiner  vice president  corporate secretary and general counsel 
all of these individuals are integral parts of our daily operations 
we have employment agreements with each of them 
we do not maintain any key life insurance policies for any of our executive officers or other personnel 
the loss of any officer could significantly impact our business until adequate replacements can be identified and put in place 
as a result of our strategic alternatives process  we are operating with a reduced work force which may affect our ability to run our business 
additionally  we may not be able to hire qualified replacements for lost employees in the future 

table of contents we face strong competition from larger oil and natural gas companies 
our competitors include large integrated oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent oil and natural gas companies  individuals and drilling and income programs 
many of these competitors are well established companies with substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we have 
these larger competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
in addition  such companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are  and will be  increasingly important to attaining success in the industry 
the geographic concentration of our oil and gas reserves may have a greater effect on our ability to sell oil and gas compared to larger  more geographically diverse companies and may make us more sensitive to price volatility 
all of our oil and gas reserves are located in texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
since our reserves are not as diversified geographically as many of our larger  more geographically diverse competitors  our business could be more subject to local conditions than other  more diversified companies 
any regional events  including price fluctuations  natural disasters  oil and gas processing or transportation interruptions  and restrictive regulations  that increase costs  reduce availability of equipment or supplies  reduce demand or limit our production may impact our operations more than if our reserves were more geographically diversified 
for example  if a hurricane strikes certain areas of the texas gulf coast  the price received for our natural gas sales may be negatively impacted due to the temporary closure of natural gas pipelines or natural gas liquids processing plants in the region impacted by the hurricane 
our business will depend on gathering and transportation facilities owned by others 
any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce 
the marketability of our crude oil and natural gas production will depend in part on the availability  proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems owned by third parties 
the amount of crude oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold is subject to curtailment in certain circumstances  such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance  excessive pressure  physical damage to the gathering or transportation system  or lack of contracted capacity on such systems 
the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months 
in many cases  we are provided only with limited  if any  notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration 
any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity  or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities  could adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
our ability to use net operating loss carryovers to offset future taxable income may be limited 
depending on the outcome of our strategic alternatives review as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  our federal income tax net operating loss nol carryforwards could be subject to the ownership change limitation provisions of the internal revenue code 
this will result in a limitation on the use of nol carryforwards to a specified amount per year 
the company expects to be able to fully utilize these existing nol carryforwards in future years 
however  there can be no certainty that any of our nol carryforwards will be utilized by us in the future 
if the waterflood project at the cockrell ranch unit of the panhandle properties is not successful  the aggregate reserves of the panhandle properties would be significantly reduced or eliminated 
cano is currently undertaking a waterflood project at the cockrell ranch unit on injection wells and producing wells on  developed acres 
production has increased from roughly boepd to over boepd since the initial phase of the project was started in july a number of performance issues  caused by using prior injectors that were open hole completed  has limited the rate of project response 
cano has embarked on an active isolation program to address these issues and retained a third party engineering firm to perform simulation modeling 
the modeling results have not been completed  as it has been postponed pending the final results of our strategic alternatives review 
once completed  it is believed that waterflood production growth will more closely track the analog east schafer ranch response profile 
under the analogous east schafer ranch profile  the cockrell ranch unit production would increase from the current levels of boepd to approximately boepd or roughly boepd per producing well within the next to months after completion 
the cockrell ranch unit contains mboe of pdp reserves based on actual performance to date and  
table of contents mboe of remaining pud reserves 
should the project response at the cockrell ranch not match the expectations for the pud reserve profile  the reserves for this project area would be significantly reduced or eliminated 
moreover  a complete failure at the cockrell ranch unit waterflood would impair the pud reserve calculations for the properties immediately adjacent to the cockrell ranch  and could partially impair the remainder of the panhandle properties 
derivative activities create a risk of potentially limiting the ability to realize profits when prices increase 
pursuant to the terms of our credit agreements  we are required to maintain our existing commodity derivative contracts to mitigate the impact of a decline in crude oil and natural gas prices 
these commodity derivative contracts could prevent us from realizing the full advantage of increases in crude oil or natural gas prices if the nymex crude oil and natural gas prices exceed the contract price ceiling 
in addition  these transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss if the counterparties to our derivative contracts fail to perform under the contracts 
also  increases in crude oil and natural gas prices negatively affect the fair value of our commodity derivatives contracts recorded on our balance sheet and  consequently  our reported net income 
changes in the recorded fair value of our derivatives contracts are marked to market through earnings and the decrease in the fair value of these contracts during any period could result in significant charges to earnings 
we are currently unable to estimate the effects on earnings in future periods  but the effects could be significant 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we are subject to section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports 
if  as a result of deficiencies in our internal controls  we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our business decision process may be adversely affected  our business and operating results could be harmed  we may be in violation of our lending covenants  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information and the price of our stock could decrease as a result 
during our evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures for the year ended june   we concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of june   in all material respects  based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
there can be no guarantee that we will not have deficiencies in our disclosure controls and internal controls in the future 
our business involves many operating risks  which may result in substantial losses  and insurance may be unavailable or inadequate to protect us against these risks 
our operations are subject to hazards and risks inherent in drilling for  producing and transporting oil and natural gas  such as fires  natural disasters  explosions  pressure forcing oil or natural gas out of the wellbore at a dangerous velocity coupled with the potential for fire or explosion  weather  failure of oilfield drilling and service tools  changes in underground pressure in a formation that causes the surface to collapse or crater  pipeline ruptures or cement failures  environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills and discharges of toxic gases  and 
table of contents availability of needed equipment at acceptable prices  including steel tubular products 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses resulting from injury or loss of life  damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repair and remediation costs 
part of our business is seasonal in nature which may affect the price of our oil and natural gas sales and severe weather may adversely impact our ability to deliver oil and natural gas production 
weather conditions affect the demand for and price of oil and natural gas 
demand for oil and natural gas is typically higher during winter months than summer months 
however  warm winters can also lead to downward price trends 
therefore  our results of operations may be adversely affected by seasonal conditions 
severe weather can cause interruptions to our production and temporarily shut in production from our wells 
unfavorable results of litigation could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business 
management currently believes that resolving any of such matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the litigation and claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view of these matters may change in the future 
there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
please see legal proceedings for a discussion of our material pending legal proceedings 
currently  our lease operating expense per boe is high in comparison to the oil and natural gas industry as a whole 
until such time as we achieve significant production growth from our waterfloods  our lease operating expense per boe should remain higher than companies drilling for primary production 
these higher operating costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
risks related to our common stock failure to obtain a satisfactory result from our strategic alternatives process could adversely affect our common stock price  and our future business and financial results 
on july   following our termination of the agreement and plan of merger with resaca we announced the initiation of a strategic alternatives process designed to achieve the best available economic value for our shareholders 
the strategic alternatives we are considering include the sale of the company  the sale of some or all of our existing oil and gas properties and assets  or potential business combinations 
we currently have a severe shortage of working capital and funds to pay our liabilities  and we currently have no available borrowing capacity under our senior or subordinated credit agreements 
we were not in compliance with the interest coverage ratio and leverage ratio at june  on august   we finalized forbearance agreements with our lenders that set certain deadlines for the execution of our strategic alternatives process and allowed us to sell certain natural gas commodity derivative contracts for million 
the cash proceeds from the sale of the derivative contracts is expected to provide us sufficient liquidity to complete our strategic alternatives process 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
as a result of the losses incurred and current negative working capital  there is no assurance that the carrying amounts of assets will be realized or that liabilities will be liquidated or settled for the amounts recorded 
the ability of cano to continue as a 
table of contents going concern is dependent upon the strategic alternatives process  as previously discussed 
there can be no assurance that our strategic alternatives process will adequately resolve issues regarding our liquidity or going concern status 
our historic stock price has been volatile and the future market price for our common stock may continue to be volatile 
this may make it difficult for you to sell our common stock for a positive return on your investment 
the public market for our common stock has historically been very volatile 
on september   our closing price on the nyse amex was 
any future market price for our shares may continue to be very volatile 
the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies 
broad market factors and the investing public s negative perception of our business may reduce our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
market fluctuations and volatility  as well as general economic  market and political conditions  could reduce our stock price 
as a result  this may make it difficult or impossible for you to sell our common stock for a positive return on your investment 
if we fail to meet continued listing standards of nyse amex  our common stock may be delisted which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
in order for our securities to be eligible for continued listing on nyse amex  we must remain in compliance with certain listing standards 
among other things  these standards require that we remain current in our filings with the sec and comply with certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of if we were to become noncompliant with nyse amex s continued listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted which would have a material adverse affect on the price of our common stock 
this is also a triggering event under our preferred stock which could cause the holders of our preferred stock to have the right to require us to redeem their preferred stock at a price of at least of the  per share stated value of the preferred stock plus accrued dividends 
if we are delisted from nyse amex  our common stock may become subject to the penny stock rules of the sec  which would make transactions in our common stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock 
the sec has adopted rule a which establishes the definition of a penny stock  for the purposes relevant to us  as any equity security that is not listed on a national securities exchange or registered national securities association s automated quotation system and has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
for any transaction involving a penny stock  unless exempt  rule g requires that a broker or dealer approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks  and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction  setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased 
in order to approve a person s account for transactions in penny stocks  the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and other information regarding the investment experience and objectives of the person  and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks 
the broker or dealer must also deliver  prior to any transaction in a penny stock  a disclosure schedule prescribed by the sec relating to the penny stock market  which  in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination  and confirms the broker or dealer received a signed  written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction 
generally  brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules 
this may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock 
if securities analysts downgrade our stock or cease coverage of us  the price of our stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business 
we do not control the reports these analysts publish about us 
furthermore  there are many large  well established  publicly traded companies active in our industry and market  which may make it less likely that we 
table of contents will receive widespread analyst coverage 
if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgraded our stock  our stock price would likely decline rapidly 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company  we could lose visibility in the market  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
we do not pay dividends on our common stock 
we have never paid dividends on our common stock  and do not intend to pay cash dividends on the common stock in the foreseeable future 
net income from our operations  if any  will be used for the development of our business  including capital expenditures  and to retire debt 
any decisions to pay dividends on the common stock in the future will depend upon our profitability at the time  available cash and other factors 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is further limited by the terms of our credit agreements and our preferred stock 
provisions in our corporate governance and loan documents  the terms of our preferred stock and delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of cano  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  our preferred stock  our bylaws  our credit agreements and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may discourage other persons from initiating a tender offer or takeover attempt that a stockholder might consider to be in the best interest of all stockholders  including takeover attempts that might result in a premium to be paid over the market price of our stock 
the terms of our preferred stock give its holders the right to have their preferred stock redeemed upon a change of control 
in addition  the terms of our preferred stock do not permit us to enter into certain transactions that would constitute a change of control unless the successor entity assumes all of our obligations relating to the preferred stock and the holders of a majority of our preferred stock approve such assumption and the successor entity is publicly traded on the nyse amex  the new york stock exchange  the nasdaq global select market  the nasdaq global market or the nasdaq capital market 
in addition  subject to the terms of the preferred stock  we are authorized to issue additional shares of preferred stock 
subject to the terms of the preferred stock and our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors has total discretion in the issuance and the determination of the rights and privileges of any shares of preferred stock which might be issued in the future  which rights and privileges may be detrimental to the holders of the common stock 
it is not possible to state the actual effect of the authorization and issuance of a new series of preferred stock upon the rights of holders of the common stock and other series of preferred stock unless and until the board of directors determines the attributes of any new series of preferred stock and the specific rights of its holders 
these effects might include restrictions on dividends on common stock and other series of preferred stock if dividends on any new series of preferred stock have not been paid  dilution of the voting power of common stock and other series of preferred stock to the extent that a new series of preferred stock has voting rights  or to the extent that any new series of preferred stock is convertible into common stock  dilution of the equity interest of common stock and other series of preferred stock  and limitation on the right of holders of common stock and other series of preferred stock to share in cano s assets upon liquidation until satisfaction of any liquidation preference attributable to any new series of preferred stock 
the terms of our preferred stock and the provisions in our corporate governance documents regarding the granting of additional preferred stock may deter or render more difficult proposals to acquire control of our company  including proposals a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest  impede or lengthen a change in membership of our board of directors and make removal of our management more difficult 
furthermore  delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between our company and owners of or more of our common stock 
these provisions apply even if an acquisition proposal is considered beneficial by some stockholders and therefore could depress the value of our common stock 

table of contents the conversion price of our preferred stock may be lowered if we issue shares of our common stock at a price less than the existing conversion price which could cause further dilution to our common stockholders 
subject to certain exclusions  if we issue common stock at a price less than the existing conversion price for our preferred stock  the conversion price shall be adjusted downward which would further dilute our common stock holders upon conversion

therefore  this case has been remanded to the district court for trial on the negligence claims and the trial date has been set for november  due to the inherent risk of litigation  the ultimate outcome of this case is uncertain and unpredictable 
at this time  cano management continues to believe that this lawsuit is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend itself and its subsidiaries  while seeking cost effective solutions to resolve this lawsuit 
based on our knowledge and judgment of the facts as of september   we believe our financial statements present fairly the effect of the actual and the anticipated future costs to resolve this matter as of june  there is no remaining insurance coverage for any claims associated with this fire litigation

the amended complaint alleges that the prospectus for the secondary offering contained statements regarding cano s proved reserve amounts and standards that were materially false and overstated cano s proved reserves 
the plaintiff is seeking to certify the lawsuit as a class action lawsuit and is seeking an unspecified amount of damages 
on july   the defendants moved to dismiss the lawsuit 
on december   the us district court for the northern district of texas granted motions to dismiss all claims brought by the plaintiffs

table of contents overview introduction we are an independent oil and natural gas company 
our strategy is to exploit our current undeveloped reserves and acquire  where economically prudent  assets suitable for enhanced oil recovery at a low cost 
we intend to convert our proved undeveloped and or unproved reserves into proved producing reserves by applying water  gas and or chemical flooding and other eor techniques 
our assets are located onshore us in texas  new mexico and oklahoma 
during our first three years of operations  our primary objective was to achieve growth through acquiring existing  mature crude oil and natural gas fields 
since then  we have focused on waterflood operations in our two largest properties  panhandle and cato 
these development activities are more clearly described below under drilling capital development and operating activities update 
as discussed under liquidity going concern  on july   we terminated our announced merger with resaca exploitation  inc resaca that had been initiated pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated september  on july  we announced the engagement of canaccord genuity and global hunter securities to assist our board in a review of strategic alternatives 
the strategic alternatives we are considering include the sale of the company  the sale of some or all of our existing oil and gas properties and assets  and potential business combinations 
proved reserves on september   we announced the results of our year year reserves review as of june  as prepared by haas  our independent petroleum engineer 
the following table compares our proved reserves by property as of june  to june  the amounts are presented in thousands of barrels oil equivalent mboe 
in mboe june  june  properties pdp pdnp pud proved pdp pdnp pud proved panhandle cato nowata davenport desdemona total proved reserves as of june   our proved reserves total mmboe  or mmboe lower than our proved reserves of mmboe at june  the primary contributors to the mmboe decrease are reduced pud reserves at the panhandle properties of mmboe  reduced pdp reserves at the cato properties of mmboe  the sale of certain wells in the panhandle properties of mmboe as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and production for the twelve month period ended june  of mmboe 
haas utilized the east schafer ranch waterflood as the analogy for assessing the pud reserves for each lease of the panhandle properties 
the east shafer ranch waterflood experienced a secondary recovery of of the original oil in place  or ooip  which equated to a secondary to primary ratio of 
haas  based solely on its professional experience and engineering judgment  determined that for the purpose of reporting the panhandle properties proved reserves  they would limit each of the panhandle properties waterflood recovery factors to a secondary to primary ratio as a maximum  and not use a percentage of ooip to determine proved reserves 
in some cases  adjustments were made since the by lease production history appeared to have allocation issues 
haas decision to limit proved reserve recovery based upon a secondary to primary ratio resulted in a proved reserve decrease of mmboe 
further  haas looked at the delayed responses cano has experienced at its cockrell ranch unit  along with reservoir conformance and permeability trends analyzed from core data  and decided to limit proved reserves to a secondary to primary ratio for the cockrell ranch and the adjacent pond lease  resulting in a proved reserve decrease of mmboe 
haas determined that the reductions to the combined company s proved reserves would be validly reclassified as probable reserves as proved reserves indicate a likelihood that production will meet or exceed the booked value while probable reserves require a confidence level to be so classified 

table of contents the reduction of pdp reserves at cato properties is a result of lower field production rates associated with lower water injection rates at the waterflood 
the reserve estimates as of june  include the effects of the sec s final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  issued in december this final rule is effective for annual reports on form k for years ending on or after december  the prices used to compute the crude oil and natural gas proved reserves represent the unweighted average first day of the month nymex crude oil and natural prices for the past fiscal months ended june   pursuant to the previously discussed sec s final rule  which we compute to be per barrel and per mmbtu  respectively  as compared to per barrel and per mmbtu on june  crude oil reserves accounted for of our total proved reserves at june  the table below summarizes the changes in our proved reserves from june  to june  summary of changes in proved reserves mboe reserves at june  extensions and discoveries sale of producing properties revisions of prior estimates production for the year ended june  reserves at june  extensions and discoveries totaling mboe include newly identified behind pipe opportunities at our cato and panhandle properties 
additionally  approximately mboe of previously categorized pdnp reserves at the desdemona properties were reclassified to pdp reserves as we are in the midst of a development project to return to production previously shut in gas wells from the duke sand formation 
our development activities are more fully described below under development capital expenditures and operating activities update 
drilling capital development and operating activities update for the quarter ending june  current quarter our production averaged  net barrels of oil equivalent per day boepd  which was boepd lower as compared to production of  boepd for the quarter ended june  prior year quarter 
production for the year ended june  fiscal year of  net boepd was boepd lower as compared to the year ended june  fiscal year of  net boepd 
these reported production amounts exclude the sale of certain panhandle properties  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  which averaged boepd during the fiscal year 
for both the current quarter and fiscal year  the production decreases were primarily attributed to mandatory lower waterflood injection volumes at our cato properties  as discussed below 
at our other properties  normal field declines of production were offset by workover activities and return to production rtp program at the desdemona field 
for the fiscal year  we incurred development capital expenditures of million excludes capitalized general and administrative and interest expenses 
our development capital budget was designed to maintain our current level of production and to minimize drawing on the arca while we pursued the completion of the planned merger with resaca 
the development capital expenditures were incurred as follows million at the cato properties  million at the panhandle properties  and million at the desdemona properties 
the following is a discussion of our field level activity during the fiscal year 
cato properties 
our fiscal year development capital plan included expanding the waterflood footprint from acres to approximately  acres by adding three new injection wells  which were put into service during the quarter ended december  we have identified a new source of water in a non productive formation within our acreage  and have 
table of contents confirmed that the water well is capable of producing  to  barrels of water per day 
this new water source formation has been penetrated in a number of existing wellbores in the cato properties and confirms the reservoir continuity necessary to validate it as a reliable water source for future expansion of the cato waterflood 
as we develop this new water source  we will be able to increase the waterflood footprint without decreasing the injection rate at our existing injectors  which should enable us to maintain production from existing producing wells at current levels 
we averaged  barrels of water injection per day bwipd during the quarter ended september  we experienced a decrease to  bwipd through march   as we measured increasing injection pressures in the northern part of the flood area and we were required  under our existing waterflood permit  to reduce the injection rate in these wells 
on may   we received administrative approval from the new mexico oil and gas conservation division nmogcd to increase injection pressures at the active wells to our current physical plant capabilities of approximately  bwipd 
as of august   we have maintained an injection rate of  bwipd  which is less than the approved rate from the nmogcd as we have reduced capital spending pending the outcome of our strategic alternatives review 
we have seen increased fluid production rates and corresponding increasing crude oil rates from this waterflood 
we have submitted an application to the nmogcd to expand the waterflood operations and expect their approval by december the cato properties will be developed through the purchase of additional equipment to increase water injection and to increase fluid production and crude oil rates from this waterflood 
additional development plans for the cato properties include behind pipe recompletions  restoration of production from the tom tom and tomahawk fields  and the drilling of a morrow formation test well 
net production at the cato properties for the quarter ended june  was boepd  which was boepd lower than the prior year quarter of boepd 
net production at the cato properties for the fiscal year was boepd  which was boepd lower than fiscal year of boepd 
the decreases for the current quarter and fiscal year resulted from the reduction in injected water and redistribution of water injection at the waterflood 
please see business properties our properties cato properties for a description of the cato properties 
panhandle properties 
in the quarter ended september   we established a controlled water injection pattern at the cockrell ranch unit to gauge the effects of optimizing water injection into the highest remaining crude oil saturation intervals of the brown dolomite formation 
we essentially performed a mini flood in the key target interval at the cockrell ranch unit 
the result of this field observation helped us determine an optimal pattern for waterflooding the balance of the cockrell ranch unit with an increasingly predicable production profile 
moreover  the field observation should improve the planning of future development programs for the remaining leases located within our panhandle properties 
to isolate the observed wells  we had temporarily shut in production during most of the quarter ended september   which reduced panhandle production by net boepd 
all production that was shut in for the controlled injection project was restored on september  we have experienced positive results from the controlled injection project 
oil production from wells in the affected area has increased to at or above target levels of boepd on a per well basis 
net production at the panhandle properties  as adjusted for the sale of certain panhandle properties as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  for the quarters ended june  and were boepd and boepd  respectively 
net production for the panhandle properties for the and fiscal years was boepd and boepd  respectively 
during the fiscal year  we constructed gathering lines to redirect natural gas production from eagle rock field services lp eagle rock to dcp midstream  lp dcp 
as of june   we had redirected approximately of the natural gas production previously delivered to eagle rock to dcp 
please see business properties our properties panhandle properties for a description of the panhandle properties 
desdemona properties 
during the fiscal year  we implemented a project to return to production previously shut in gas wells from the duke sand formation 
we converted approximately mboe of previously pdnp reserves to pdp reserves for rtp d gas wells in december production increased from boepd for the quarter ended december  to boepd for the quarter ended march  without the benefit of selling any natural gas liquids ngls 
we rtp d an additional wells during the quarter ended june  production from all of the rtp d natural gas wells  including associated ngl recovery from our gas plant  is expected to be approximately mcfe per day for each gas well returned to production 
we have re equipped our gas plant to handle the increased natural gas production and the gas plant became functional during august daily production from the desdemona properties is projected to be boepd 

table of contents during the quarter ended march   we drilled one new well to a total depth of  feet to test the marble falls  atoka and strawn sand formations 
we have completed the new well in the strawn sand formation at a depth of  feet 
as of august   the well produced boepd 
we are currently evaluating this well to optimize production 
net production at the desdemona properties for the quarters ended june  and june  was boepd and boepd  respectively 
net production at the desdemona properties for the and fiscal years was boepd and boepd  respectively 
during july  we shut in our barnett shale natural gas wells based upon the then current and the outlook for natural gas prices from the barnett shale wells

nowata properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the nowata properties were mmboe  of which mmboe were pdp and mmboe were pdnp 
net production for the quarters ended june  and june  was boepd and boepd  respectively 
net production for the and fiscal years was boepd and boepd  respectively 
we are currently assessing our operations at the nowata properties to increase production  including constructing an additional gas gathering system and optimizing current infrastructure 
please see business properties our properties nowata properties for a description of the nowata properties 
davenport properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the davenport properties were mmboe  of which mmboe were pdp and mmboe were pdnp 
net production for the quarters ended june  and june  was boepd and boepd  respectively 
net production for the and fiscal years was boepd and boepd  respectively

industry conditions we operate in a competitive environment for i acquiring properties  ii marketing oil and natural gas and iii attracting trained personnel 
some of our competitors possess and employ financial resources substantially greater than ours and some of our competitors employ more technical personnel 
some of our competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than what our financial or technical resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to identify  evaluate and obtain capital for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
eor techniques involve significant capital investment and an extended period of time  generally a year or longer  until production increases 
generally  surfactant polymer injection is regarded as more risky as compared to waterflood operations 
our ability to successfully convert pud reserves to pdp reserves will be contingent upon our ability to obtain future financing and or raise additional capital 
further  there are inherent uncertainties associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas  as well as price volatility

risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity going concern at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
we had negative working capital of million  which includes million of long term debt that was shown as a current liability 
for the year ended june   we had cash flow used in operations of million  which included million of merger related cash expenses 
on july   we terminated our announced merger with resaca exploitation  inc resaca that had been initiated pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger dated september  on july  we announced the engagement of canaccord genuity and global hunter securities to assist our board in a review of strategic alternatives  with a goal of maximizing economic value for our shareholders 
the strategic alternatives we are considering include the sale of the company  the sale of some or all of our existing oil and gas properties and assets  and potential business combinations 
we currently have limited access to capital 
on august   we finalized consent and forbearance agreements with the lenders under our credit agreements that waived potential covenant compliance issues for the periods ending june  and september   set certain deadlines for the execution of our strategic alternatives review and allowed us 
table of contents to sell certain natural gas commodity derivative contracts for cash proceeds of million  which was intended to provide cano sufficient liquidity to complete its strategic alternatives review 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we currently have no available borrowing capacity under our senior and subordinated credit agreements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates continuity of operations  realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
as a result of losses incurred and our current negative working capital  there is no assurance that the carrying amounts of assets will be realized or that liabilities will be settled for the amounts recorded 
the ability of the company to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon the outcome of the strategic alternatives review 
unless we are able to successfully execute one of our strategic alternatives  restructure our existing indebtedness  obtain further waivers or forbearance from our existing lenders or otherwise raise significant additional capital  it is unlikely that we will be able to meet our obligations as they become due and to continue as a going concern 
on december   our universal shelf registration statement was declared effective by the sec for the issuance of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  senior debt and subordinated debt up to an aggregate amount of million 
after the issuance of common stock on july   we have million of availability under this registration  however  the amount of securities which we may offer pursuant to this shelf registration statement during any twelve month period shall be limited to one third of the aggregate market value of the common equity of the company held by our non affiliates since our public float is not in excess of million 
we may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts  prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered 
at the time any of the securities covered by the registration statement are offered for sale  a prospectus supplement will be prepared and filed with the sec containing specific information about the terms of any such offering 
the universal shelf registration statement expires on december  credit agreements at june  and  the outstanding amount due under our credit agreements was million and million  respectively

credit agreement covenant compliance both the arca and the sca have a current ratio covenant that requires us to maintain a ratio of not less than to for each fiscal quarter 
the current ratio is calculated by dividing current assets as defined in both credit agreements by current liabilities as defined in both credit agreements 
current assets include unused borrowing base under the arca and the aggregate availability under the sca 
current liabilities exclude all current portions of long term debt other than any current debt relating to the preferred stock and liabilities for asset retirement obligations 
current assets and current liabilities exclude derivative assets and liabilities

the minimum asset coverage ratio is calculated by dividing i total present value as of the applicable determination date  which is defined as the sum of of the net present value  discounted at per annum  of the future net revenues expected to accrue to a pdp reserves  b pdnp reserves and c pud reserves  with the total present value of pdp reserves being at least of the aggregate total present value  by ii consolidated debt as defined in the subordinated credit agreement as of the applicable determination date 
at june   our minimum asset coverage ratio was to  calculated as follows in thousands quarter ended june  total present value non gaap c june  long term debt gaap d total present value to debt c d to results of operations years ended june   and overall for the fiscal year  we had a loss applicable to common stock of million  which was a million decrease as compared to income applicable to common stock of million for the fiscal year 
items contributing to the million decrease were reduced gain on derivatives of million  decreased income from preferred stock repurchased for less than the carrying amount of million and lower income from discontinued operations of million 
partially offsetting the earnings decrease were lower operating expenses of million  which is primarily attributable to a million charge for impairment of long lived assets during the fiscal year 
other items that decreased operating expenses were reductions to general and administrative expenses of million  decreased exploration expense of million and lower lease operating expenses of million 

table of contents for the fiscal year  we had income applicable to common stock of million  which was a million improvement as compared to the million loss applicable to common stock for the fiscal year 
items that led to the improvement were increased gain on derivatives of million  preferred stock repurchased for less than the carrying amount of million  higher income from discontinued operations of million and lower preferred stock dividend of million 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher operating expenses of million  lower operating revenues of million  lower deferred income tax benefit of million and goodwill impairment of million

fiscal year the fiscal year operating revenues of million were million lower as compared to the fiscal year operating revenues of million 
the million reduction is primarily attributable to decreased crude oil and natural gas sales volumes  which lowered revenues by million and million  respectively  and lower other revenues of million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased prices received for crude oil and natural gas sales volumes of million and million  respectively 
crude oil sales 
our fiscal year crude oil sales were mbbls lower as compared to the fiscal year due to lower sales from our cato properties and panhandle properties of mbbls and mbbls  respectively 
the sales decrease at our cato properties resulted from the redistribution of water injection at the waterflood which resulted in lower production  as discussed under overview drilling capital development and operating activities update 
the sales decrease at the panhandle properties is due to the controlled injection project at the cockrell ranch waterflood and severe weather during january and february which temporarily curtailed production 
all cockrell ranch production that had been temporarily shut in for the controlled injection project was restored on september  natural gas sales 
our fiscal year natural gas sales were mmcf lower as compared to the fiscal year primarily due to lower sales at the panhandle properties of mmcf  desdemona properties of mmcf and cato properties of mmcf 
lower natural gas sales at the panhandle properties resulted from severe weather and from the controlled production project at cockrell ranch waterflood  as previously discussed  and one of our gas purchasers experiencing unplanned plant outages during august  september  may and june  which resulted in reduced natural gas and ngl sales 
lower natural gas sales at the desdemona properties resulted from the shut in natural gas production from our barnett shale wells during july  based upon the then current and near term outlook of natural gas prices  and the temporary shut in of our gas plant to equip the plant to handle increased natural gas production from the return to production of shut in duke sand gas wells as previously discussed under the overview drilling capital development and operating activities update 
lower natural gas sales at the cato properties resulted from the purchaser temporarily declining to take natural gas production from january through march 
table of contents fiscal year v 
fiscal year the fiscal year operating revenues of million were million lower as compared to the fiscal year operating revenues of million 
the million reduction is primarily attributable to lower prices received for crude oil and natural gas sales  which lowered revenues by million and million  respectively  and by lower natural gas sales volumes  which lowered revenues by million 
these decreases were partially offset by increased crude oil sales volumes  which increased revenues by million 
crude oil sales 
for the fiscal year  approximately of the increased crude oil sales of mbbls were attributed to the waterflood development activity at the cato properties 
also  we had increased crude oil sales from the panhandle properties due to the waterflood development 
natural gas sales 
for the fiscal year  the overall decrease in natural gas sales of mmcf pertains primarily to reductions with respect to our barnett shale project at our desdemona properties 
during the first half of calendar year  various workovers and re fracture stimulations were attempted to increase production 
through december  these efforts were met with marginal success 
in january  we halted our workover program in the desdemona properties barnett shale 
once the barnett shale workover activity ceased  we experienced barnett shale production declines of approximately 
also  higher gas production from the cato properties due to the aforementioned development activity was offset by lower gas production from our panhandle properties due to normal field decline of approximately annually and temporary pipeline curtailments of gas deliveries to our gas purchasers 
crude oil and natural gas prices the average price we receive for crude oil sales is generally at market prices received at the wellhead  except for the cato properties  for which we receive below market prices due to the level of impurities in the oil 
differentials increased briefly as commodity prices rapidly declined between july and december  however  the differentials have since recovered 
the average price we receive for natural gas sales is approximately the market price received at the wellhead  adjusted for the value of natural gas liquids  less transportation and marketing expenses 
the average prices we received for our crude oil and natural gas sales were supplemented or reduced by commodity derivative settlements received or paid for the  and fiscal years 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are lower than the floor prices  we will be reimbursed by our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and floor price ie realized gain 
conversely  if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are higher than the derivative ceiling prices  we will pay our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and ceiling price ie realized loss 
operating expenses fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our total operating expenses were million  or million lower than the fiscal year of million 
the fiscal year included an impairment of long lived assets of million  which is the primary reason for the overall decrease 
in addition  we had reduced general and administrative of million  reduced exploration expense of million  lower lease operating expenses of million and lower depletion and depreciation expense of million 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our total operating expenses were million  or million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the primary contributors to the increase were an impairment of long lived assets of million and exploration expense of million associated with the desdemona properties duke sands waterflood project 
in addition  we experienced increased lease operating expenses of million  general and administrative of million and higher depletion and depreciation of million 

table of contents lease operating expenses our lease operating expenses loe consist of the costs of producing crude oil and natural gas such as labor  supplies  repairs  maintenance  workovers and utilities 
for the fiscal year  our loe was million  which is million lower than fiscal year of million 
the million decrease resulted primarily from reduced service rates negotiated with vendors of million  the shut in of our barnett shale natural gas wells which reduced loe by million and lower electricity expense of million 
partially offsetting these loe cost reductions were increased loe at the cato properties of million to support increased focus on production activities 
for the fiscal year  our loe per boe  based on production  was reduced by per boe to as compared to for the fiscal year for the reasons previously discussed 
for the quarter ended june   the loe per boe was 
in general  secondary and tertiary loe is higher than the loe for companies developing primary production because our fields are more mature and typically produce less oil and more water 
however  we expect our loe per boe to decrease during the fiscal year as we realize the benefit of a full year of lower service rates with vendors 
further  we expect loe per boe to decrease as production increases from the waterflood and eor development activities we have implemented and are implementing as discussed under the drilling capital development and operating activities update 
for the fiscal year  our loe was million  which is million higher than fiscal year of million 
the million increase resulted primarily from increased workover activities and general repairs at the panhandle properties of million and higher operating expenses incurred at the cato properties of million to support increased crude oil and natural gas sales  as discussed under operating revenues  partially offset by lower operating expenses of million due to lower natural gas sales at the desdemona properties  as discussed under operating revenues 
we also had higher loe at the davenport and nowata properties of million due to increased electricity expenses  general repairs and workover expenses 
the workover activities at the panhandle properties pertained to returning wells to production and have increased production  as discussed under operating revenues 
for the fiscal year  our loe per boe was  which is an per boe increase as compared to for fiscal year the per boe increase is due to the reasons previously discussed 
production and ad valorem taxes for the fiscal year  our production and ad valorem taxes were million  which is million lower than the fiscal year of million 
our production taxes were lower by million due to lower operating revenues and ad valorem taxes were lower by million due to reductions in tax property valuations by taxing authorities 
our production taxes as a percent of operating revenues for the fiscal year of was comparable to the fiscal year of 
we anticipate the fiscal year to be subject to similar production tax rates 
for the fiscal year  our production and ad valorem taxes were million  which is comparable to fiscal year 
our production taxes were lower by million due to lower operating revenues  which was offset by increased ad valorem taxes of million 
the increased ad valorem taxes were due to notification of revisions in tax property valuations by taxing authorities for the calendar year 
therefore  the fiscal year includes higher tax rates for the twelve months plus a charge for applying the rates to the first six months of the calendar year 
our production taxes as a percent of operating revenues for the fiscal year of was comparable to the fiscal year of 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses consist of support services for our operating activities  legal matters and investor relations costs 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our g a expenses totaled million  which is million lower than fiscal year of million 
the million expense reduction resulted primarily from reduced litigation costs of million  reduced share based compensation costs of million  and lower payroll and benefits costs of million 
partially offsetting these expense reductions were increased costs related to the terminated merger of million 
the reduced payroll and benefits costs resulted from workforce reductions we implemented during the quarter ended march   which eliminated of our home office staff 
the lower share based compensation costs are directly related to reduced issuances 
table of contents of stock options and restricted stock 
the litigation cost reduction occurred as we settled all but one of our fire litigation claims during the fiscal year ended june  fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our g a expenses totaled million  which is million higher than fiscal year of million 
the primary contributors to the million increase were higher litigation costs of million pertaining to the settlement costs and legal fees pertaining to the fire litigation and increased stock compensation expense of million  partially offset by reduced payroll expense of million 
during the quarter ended march   we took steps to reduce our payroll  eliminating of our home office staff 
the quarter ended june  was the first time we realized these savings 
exploration expense during the fiscal year  we recorded exploration expense of million pertaining to the nowata asp project 
during december  we finalized our performance analysis  which indicated the nowata asp project did not result in significantly increased oil production quantities and is therefore considered not economically viable 
accordingly  at december   we recorded a million pre tax exploration expense 
during the fiscal year  we recorded exploration expense of million pertaining to the duke sand waterflood project 
the primary source of water for this waterflood project had been derived from our barnett shale wells 
as we shut in our barnett shale natural gas production due to uneconomic natural gas commodity prices  we no longer had an economic source of water to continue flooding the duke sand 
therefore  our rate of water injection had been reduced to a point where we could not consider the waterflood active 
we continue to believe that this reservoir is an excellent secondary and tertiary recovery candidate  however  we do not have plans to recommence injection for the foreseeable future 
impairment of long lived assets during the fiscal year  we wrote down million of costs associated with the asp facility used for the nowata asp project 
the facility s water filtering process did not work properly with the oil water fluid production at our nowata properties 
the asp facility is portable and may be used in future pilot tertiary projects at our cato and panhandle properties 
during the fiscal year  we recorded a million impairment on our barnett shale properties as the decline in commodity prices created an uncertainty about the likelihood of developing our reserves associated with our barnett shale natural gas properties within the next five years 
therefore  during the quarter ended december   we recorded a million pre tax impairment to our barnett shale properties 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded an additional million pre tax impairment to our barnett shale properties as the forward outlook for natural gas prices continued to decline and we shut in our barnett shale natural gas wells 
the fair value was determined using estimates of future production volumes  prices and operating expenses  discounted to a present value 
depletion and depreciation for the fiscal year  our depletion and depreciation expense was million  a decrease of million as compared to the fiscal year depletion and depreciation expense 
this includes depletion expense pertaining to our oil and natural gas properties  and depreciation expense pertaining to our field operations vehicles and equipment  natural gas plant  office furniture and computers 
the decrease is due to decreased crude oil and natural gas sales volumes net as previously discussed under operating revenues 
for the fiscal year  our depletion rate pertaining to our oil and gas properties was per boe  as compared to the fiscal year rate of per boe 
the decreased depletion rates resulted primarily from our reserve redetermination at december  and periodic assessments of depletion rates during the fiscal year  and impairments of our barnett shale properties  as previously discussed 
for the fiscal year  our depletion and depreciation expense was million  an increase of million as compared to the fiscal year depletion and depreciation expense 
the increase is due to increased crude oil and natural gas sales volumes net as previously discussed under operating revenues and higher per boe depletion rates 
for the fiscal year  our depletion rate pertaining to our oil and gas properties was per boe  as compared to the fiscal year rate of per boe 
the increased depletion rates resulted from higher depletion rates for our cato and panhandle properties based on our reserve estimates at june  and periodic assessments of depletion rates during the fiscal year 

table of contents interest expense and other for the  and fiscal years  we recorded interest expense of million  million and million  respectively  as a direct result of the credit agreements we entered into  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the interest expense for the  and fiscal years was reduced by million  million and million  respectively  for interest cost that was capitalized to the waterflood and asp projects discussed under the drilling capital development and operating activities update 
we incurred higher interest costs during both the and fiscal years due to higher outstanding debt balances and higher interest rates 
gain loss on commodity derivatives as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into financial contracts for our commodity derivatives and our interest rate swap 
for the fiscal year  the loss on commodity derivatives of million consisted of an unrealized loss of million and a realized gain of million 
for the fiscal year  the gain on commodity derivatives of million consisted of an unrealized gain of million and a realized gain on settlements of commodity derivative contracts of million 
for the fiscal year  the loss on commodity derivatives of million consisted of unrealized and realized losses of million and million  respectively 
for the realization of settlements  if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are lower than the floor prices  we will be reimbursed by our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and floor price ie realized gain 
conversely  if crude oil and natural gas nymex prices are higher than the ceiling prices  we will pay our counterparty for the difference between the nymex price and ceiling price ie realized loss 
the unrealized gain for the fiscal year reflects the change in fair value of the commodity derivatives during the fiscal year 
by their nature  these commodity derivatives can have a highly volatile impact on our earnings 
a ten percent change in the nymex prices for crude oil and natural gas that impact our commodity derivative instruments could affect our pre tax earnings by approximately million 
income tax benefit expense for the fiscal year  we had an income tax benefit of million 
for the fiscal year  we had income tax expense of million 
for the fiscal year  we had an income tax benefit of million 
these tax amounts included taxes related to discontinued operations as shown in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the higher amount of income taxes for the fiscal year  as compared to the and fiscal years  is due to higher taxable income and an increase in other permanent items  as presented in note to our consolidated financial statements  resulting in an aggregate rate of 
the income tax rates for the and fiscal years was and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations for the  and fiscal years  we had income from discontinued operations of million  million and million  respectively  due to our divestitures of the pantwist  llc  corsicana properties and certain panhandle properties  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
preferred stock dividend the preferred stock dividend for the fiscal year of million was a decrease of million from the fiscal year 
this resulted from the november and december repurchases of preferred stock as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
due to the repurchases  our quarterly preferred stock dividends will be approximately million per quarter of which will be paid in kind  with the balance paid in cash 
the preferred stock dividend for the fiscal year of million was a decrease of million from the fiscal year 
this resulted from the november and december repurchases of preferred stock  as previously discussed 
also  the fiscal year amount includes million of federal tax we were required to withhold in accordance with internal revenue service regulations from september through june these amounts did not have a material effect to our prior period financial statements 
due to the previously discussed repurchases  we no longer have any preferred stock that require withholding taxes

critical accounting policies we have identified the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
these are the accounting policies that we have determined involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
consolidation and use of estimates the accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and include the accounts of cano and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated 
in preparing the accompanying financial statements  management has made certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingencies 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
significant assumptions are required in the valuation of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves  which may affect the amount at which crude oil and natural gas properties are recorded 
the computation of share based compensation expense requires assumptions such as volatility  expected life and the risk free interest rate 
our liabilities and assets associated with commodity derivatives involve significant assumptions related to volatility and future prices for crude oil and natural gas 
it is at least reasonably possible these estimates could be revised in the near term  and these revisions could be material 
cano s proved reserves the term proved reserves is defined by the sec in rule a of regulation s x adopted under the securities act of  as amended 
in general  proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological or engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices based on an unweighted month average and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based on future conditions 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if proved reserves decline  then the rate at which we record depletion expense increases 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves may result from lower prices  new information obtained from development drilling and production history  mechanical problems on our wells  and catastrophic events such as explosions  hurricanes and floods 
lower prices also may make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs 
in addition  a decline in proved reserves may impact our assessment of our oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
our proved reserves estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate materially from actual results 
as such  reserves estimates may vary materially from the ultimate quantities of crude oil and natural gas actually produced 
oil and gas properties and equipment we follow the successful efforts method of accounting 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals  are charged to expense 
the costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells are deferred until the company has determined whether proved reserves have been found 
if proved reserves are found  the deferred costs are capitalized as part of the wells and related equipment and facilities 
if no proved reserves are found  the deferred costs are charged to expense 
all development activity costs are capitalized 
we are primarily engaged in the development and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas properties 
our activities are considered development where existing proved reserves are identified prior to commencement of the project and are considered exploration if there are no proved reserves at the beginning of such project 
the property costs reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets resulted from acquisition and development activities and deferred exploratory drilling costs 
capitalized overhead costs that directly relate to our drilling and development activities were million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
we recorded capitalized interest costs of million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
costs for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from existing producing reservoirs are charged to expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced that extends the useful or productive life of the property is capitalized 
costs to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reservoirs are capitalized 

table of contents depreciation and depletion of producing properties are computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
our unit of production amortization rates are revised prospectively on a quarterly basis based on updated engineering information for our proved developed reserves 
our development costs and lease and wellhead equipment are depleted based on proved developed reserves 
our leasehold costs are depleted based on total proved reserves 
investments in major development projects are not depleted until such project is substantially complete and producing or until impairment occurs 
as of june  and  capitalized costs related to waterflood and alkaline surfactant polymer asp projects that were in process and not subject to depletion amounted to million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were deferred costs related to drilling and equipping exploratory wells associated with our asp project  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
if conditions indicate that long term assets may be impaired  the carrying value of our properties is compared to management s future estimated undiscounted net cash flow from the properties 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then the asset value is written down to fair value 
impairment of individually significant unproved properties is assessed on a property by property basis  and impairment of other unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis 
the impairment assessment is affected by factors such as the results of exploration and development activities  commodity price projections  remaining lease terms  and potential shifts in our business strategy 
asset retirement obligation our financial statements reflect the fair value of our asset retirement obligation aro  which consists of future plugging and abandonment expenditures related to our oil and gas properties  that can be reasonably estimated  and discounted at our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated fair value at the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties on the consolidated balance sheets  which is depreciated such that the cost of the aro is recognized over the useful life of the asset 
periodic accretion of the discount of the estimated liability to its expected settlement value is recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
inherent in the fair value calculation of aro are numerous assumptions and judgments  including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the fair value of the existing aro liability  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition is based on the sales method 
we do not have imbalances for natural gas sales since we are primarily the working interest owner in our properties 
we recognize revenue when crude oil and natural gas quantities are delivered to or collected by the respective purchaser 
title to the produced quantities transfers to the purchaser at the time the purchaser receives or collects the quantities 
prices for such production are defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on publicly available information 
the purchasers of such production have historically made payment for crude oil and natural gas purchases within thirty five days of the end of each production month 
we periodically review the difference between the dates of production and the dates we collect payment for such production to ensure that accounts receivable from the purchasers are collectible 
the point of sale for our crude oil and natural gas production is at our applicable field tank batteries and gathering systems  therefore  we do not incur transportation costs related to our sales of crude oil and natural gas production 
as previously discussed  for the years ended june   and  we sold our crude oil and natural gas production to several independent purchasers 
the following table shows purchasers that accounted for or more of our total operating revenues year ended june  valero marketing supply co 
coffeyville resources refinery and marketing  llc plains marketing  lp eagle rock field services  lp dcp midstream  lp less than of operating revenue 
table of contents share based compensation expense we account for share based payment arrangements with employees and directors at their grant date fair value and record the related expense over their respective service periods 
the value of share based compensation is impacted by our stock price  which has been highly volatile  and items that require management s judgment  such as expected lives and forfeiture rates 
derivatives we are required to maintain commodity derivative contracts for a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production under our senior and subordinated credit agreements  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the purpose of the derivatives is to reduce our exposure to declining commodity prices 
by locking in minimum prices  we protect our cash flows which support our annual capital expenditure plans 
we have entered into commodity derivatives that involve costless collars and swaps for our crude oil and natural gas sales 
these derivatives are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets based upon their respective fair values 
we have entered into an interest rate basis swap contract to reduce our exposure to future interest rate increases 
we do not designate our derivatives as cash flow or fair value hedges 
we do not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our commodity and interest rate swap derivatives 
we anticipate  however  that our counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations under our commodity and interest rate swap derivatives contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support our commodity derivatives contracts nor are we required to post any collateral 
we monitor the credit standing of our counterparties to understand our credit risk 
changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments and cash flows resulting from the settlement of our derivative instruments are recorded in earnings as gains or losses on derivatives on our consolidated statements of operations

table of contents on december   the sec issued release no 
 modernization of oil and gas reporting  which revises disclosure requirements for oil and gas companies 
in addition to changing the definition and disclosure requirements for oil and gas reserves  the new rules change the requirements for determining oil and gas reserve quantities 
these rules permit the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves under certain criteria and allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves 
the new rules also require companies to report the independence and qualifications of their reserve preparer or auditor and file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conducts a reserve audit 
the new rules also require that oil and gas reserves be reported using a twelve month average price rather than period end prices 
the new rules are effective for annual reports on forms k for fiscal years ending on or after december  early adoption of the new rules is prohibited

 extractive activities oil and gas topic  to align with the requirements of the sec s revised rules 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic 
asu subtopic provides new guidance on improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
the new standard requires some new disclosures and clarifies some existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement 
specifically  the new standard will now require a a reporting entity should disclose separately the amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and describe the reasons for transfers and b in the reconciliation for fair value measurements using significant unoberservable inputs  a reporting entity should present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
in addition  the new standard clarifies the requirements of the following existing disclosures a for purposes of reporting fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities  a reporting entity needs to use judgment in determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities and b a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the new standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
early application is permitted 
the adoption of the requirements of this standard in the quarter ended march  did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
