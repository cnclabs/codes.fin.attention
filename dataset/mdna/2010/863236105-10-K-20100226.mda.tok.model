background and overview we are an education services holding company that owns strayer university  inc strayer university is an institution of higher education which offers undergraduate and graduate degree programs at campuses including three new campuses opened for the winter term enrollment and four new campuses opened for the spring term enrollment in alabama  arkansas  delaware  florida  georgia  kentucky  louisiana  maryland  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  utah  virginia  west virginia  washington  dc  and worldwide via the internet 
we plan to open a total of new campuses in  including the seven that have already been opened 
as set forth below  average enrollment  full time tuition rates  revenues  income from operations  net income  and diluted net income per share have all increased in each of the last three years 
year ended december  average enrollment change from prior year full time tuition per course change from prior year revenues in thousands change from prior year income from operations in thousands change from prior year net income in thousands change from prior year diluted net income per share change from prior year strayer university derives approximately of its revenue from tuition collected from its students 
the academic year of the university is divided into four quarters  which approximately coincide with the four quarters of the calendar year 
students make payment arrangements for the tuition for each course prior to the beginning of the quarter 
when students register for courses  tuition is recorded as unearned tuition  and is recognized in the quarter of instruction 
if a student withdraws from a course prior to completion  the university refunds a portion of the tuition depending on when the withdrawal occurs 
tuition revenue is shown net of any refunds  withdrawals  corporate discounts  employee tuition discounts and scholarships 
the university also derives revenue from other sources such as textbook related income  application fees  commencement fees  placement test fees  withdrawal fees  loan administration fees  and other income  which are all recognized when earned 
at the time of registration  unearned tuition a liability is recorded for academic services to be provided and a tuition receivable is recorded for the portion of the tuition not paid upfront in cash 
because the university s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters  tuition receivable at the end of any calendar quarter largely represents student tuition due for the following academic quarter 
based upon past experience and judgment  the university establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable not included in unearned tuition 
any uncollected account more than six months past due for students who have left the university is charged against the allowance

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments related to its allowance for uncollectible accounts  income tax provisions  valuation of deferred tax assets  forfeiture rates for stock based compensation plans and accrued expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
tuition revenue is deferred at the time of registration and is recognized as income  net of any refunds or withdrawals  in the respective quarter of instruction 
advance registrations for the next quarter are recorded as unearned tuition 
we record estimates for our allowance for uncollectible accounts for tuition receivable from students 
if the financial condition of our students were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make required payments for tuition payable to us  additional allowances may be required 
we record estimates for our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities 
we periodically review our assumed forfeiture rates for stock based awards and adjust them as necessary 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to our accrued expenses  stock based compensation expense  and income tax liabilities may be required 
new campuses our goal is to serve the demand for post secondary adult education nationwide by opening new campuses every year 
a new campus typically requires up to million in upfront capital costs for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computer equipment 
in the first year of operation  assuming a mid year opening  we expect to incur operating losses of approximately million including depreciation related to the upfront capital costs 
a new campus is typically expected to begin 
table of contents generating operating income on a quarterly basis in four to six quarters of operation  which is generally upon reaching an enrollment level of about students 
our new campus notional model assumes an increase of average enrollment by students per year until reaching a level of about  students 
given the potential internal rate of return achieved with each new campus an estimated  opening new campuses is an important part of our strategy 
we believe we have sufficient capital resources from cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated from operating activities to continue to open new campuses for at least the next months 
we plan to open new campuses in including seven already opened 
we opened new campuses in and nine in see new campuses opened table in item for information regarding the locations of these new campuses 
second global online operations center we also opened our second global online operations center in to accommodate the demand among students who neither live nor work near a physical campus location 
this new operations center is located in salt lake city  utah
