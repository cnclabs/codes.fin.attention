risk factors above  in evaluating any statement in this report on form k or otherwise made by us or on our behalf 
the following information is unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
we have no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements 
overview we are a full service communications provider and one of the largest exchange telephone carriers in the country 
as of december   we operated in states with approximately  employees 
on may   we entered into a definitive agreement with verizon under which frontier will acquire defined assets and liabilities of the local exchange business and related landline activities of verizon in the spinco territory  including internet access and long distance services and broadband video provided to designated customers in the spinco territory 
assuming that the merger occurred on december   the merger would have resulted in frontier acquiring approximately million access lines and certain business related assets from verizon 
the verizon transaction will be financed with approximately billion of common stock plus the assumption of approximately billion in debt 
certain of the conditions to the closing of the verizon transaction have already been met frontier s shareholders approved the verizon transaction at a special meeting of shareholders held on october   the federal trade commission has granted early termination of the waiting period under the hart scott rodino act  approvals of all necessary local video franchise authorities subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  receipt by verizon of a favorable ruling from the irs regarding the tax consequences of the verizon transaction  and five of the nine required state regulatory approvals 
completion of the verizon transaction remains subject to a number of other conditions  including the receipt of the remaining four state regulatory approvals  approval from the fcc  the completion of financing on terms that satisfy certain conditions as well as other customary closing conditions 
subject to satisfaction of these conditions  we anticipate closing this transaction during the second quarter of during  we completed the acquisitions of commonwealth telephone enterprises  inc commonwealth or cte  and global valley networks  inc and gvn services together gvn which expanded our presence in pennsylvania and california  and strengthened our position as a leading full service communications provider to rural markets 
our revenues declined in revenues from data and internet services such as hsi grew and increased as a percentage of our total revenues and revenues from local access lines and access charges including federal and state subsidies declined and decreased as a percentage of our total revenues 
regulatory revenue includes switched access and subsidy revenue and represents of our revenues in switched access revenue was million in  or of our revenues  down from million in  or of our revenues 
federal and state subsidy revenue  including surcharges billed to customers that are remitted to the fcc  was million in  or of our revenues  down from million in  or of our revenues 
we expect these revenue trends in switched access and subsidy revenue to continue in competition in the communications industry is intense and increasing 
we experience competition from many communications service providers 
these providers include cable operators offering video  data  and voip products  wireless carriers  long distance providers  competitive local exchange carriers  internet providers and other wireline carriers 
we believe that as of december   approximately of the households in our territories had voip as an available service option 
we also believe that competition will continue in and may result in reduced revenues 
the lingering impact of the severe contraction in the global financial markets that occurred in and and the subsequent recession has impacted residential and business customer behavior to reduce expenditures by not purchasing our services or by discontinuing some or all of our services 
these trends may continue and may result in a continued challenging revenue environment 
these factors could also result in increased delinquencies and bankruptcies and  therefore  affect our ability to collect money owed to us by residential and business customers 
we employ a number of strategies to combat the competitive pressures and changes in consumer behavior noted above 
our strategies are focused on preserving and generating new revenues through customer retention  upgrading and up selling services to our existing customer base  new customer growth  win backs of former customers  new product deployment  and upon managing our profitability and cash flow through targeted reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures 
we seek to achieve our customer retention goals by offering attractive packages of value added services to our access line customers and providing exemplary customer service 
bundled services include hsi  unlimited long distance calling  enhanced telephone features and video offerings 
we tailor these services to the needs of our residential and business customers and continually evaluate the introduction of new and complementary products and services  many of which can also be purchased separately 
customer retention is also enhanced by offering one  two and three year price protection plans where customers commit to a term in exchange for predictable pricing and or promotional offers 
additionally  we are focused on enhancing the customer experience as we believe exceptional customer service will differentiate us from our competition 
our commitment to providing exemplary customer service is demonstrated by our expanded customer service hours  shorter scheduling windows for in home appointments and the previously implemented call reminders and follow up calls for service appointments 
in addition  our local area markets are operated by local managers with responsibility for the customer experience  as well as the financial results  in those markets 
customers in our markets have direct access to those local managers to help them manage their communications needs 
we utilize targeted and innovative promotions like aspirational gifts eg  personal computers or promotional credits to attract new customers  including those moving into our territory  to win back former customers and to upgrade and up sell existing customers a variety of service offerings including hsi  video  and enhanced long distance and feature packages in order to maximize the average revenue per customer wallet share paid to us 
depending upon market and economic conditions  we may offer such promotions to drive sales in the future 
we have restructured and augmented our sales distribution channels to improve coverage of all segments of the business customer base 
this includes adding new sales teams dedicated to small business customers and enhancing the business selling and support skills in our customer sales and service centers 
we have also increased our focus on customer premise equipment cpe sales for customers requiring an equipment solution  and have extended our cpe sales reach beyond a handful of markets 
in addition  we are introducing new products utilizing wireless and internet technologies 
we believe the combination of new products and distribution channel improvements will help us improve business customer acquisition and retention 
we are also focused on increasing sales of newer products  including unlimited long distance minutes  bundles of long distance minutes  wireless data  internet portal advertising  and the frontier peace of mind product suite 
this last category is a suite of products that is aimed at managing the total communications and personal computing experience for our customers and designed to provide value and simplicity to meet our customers ever changing needs 
the frontier peace of mind products and services suite includes services such as an in home  full installation of our hsi product  two hour appointment windows for the installation  hard drive back up services  help desk pc support and inside wire maintenance when bundled 
in  the frontier peace of mind products generated approximately million in revenue 
most recently  we introduced our myfitv 
com website which provides easy online access to video content  entertainment and news available on the worldwide web 
our hard drive back up services  help desk pc support and myfitv 
com services are also available outside of our service territories 
although we are optimistic about the opportunities provided by each of these initiatives to increase revenue and reduce churn  we can provide no assurance about their long term profitability or impact on revenue 
we believe that the combination of offering multiple products and services to our customers pursuant to price protection programs  billing them on a single bill  providing superior customer service  and being active in our local communities will make our customers more loyal  and will help us generate new  and retain existing  customer revenue 
a liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents aggregating million 
our primary source of funds continued to be cash generated from operations 
for the year ended december   we used cash flow from operations  new borrowings and cash on hand to fund all of our investing and financing activities  including debt repayments 
we believe our operating cash flows  existing cash balances  and revolving credit facility will be adequate to finance our working capital requirements  fund capital expenditures  make required debt payments  pay taxes  pay dividends to our stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy  pay our acquisition and integration costs and capital expenditures  and support our short term and long term operating strategies through however  a number of factors  including but not limited to  losses of access lines  pricing pressure from increased competition  lower subsidy and access revenues and the impact of the current economic environment are expected to reduce our cash generated by operations 
in addition  although we believe  based on information available to us  that the financial institutions syndicated under our revolving credit facility would be able to fulfill their commitments to us  given the current economic environment and the recent severe contraction in the global financial markets  this could change in the future 
further  the current credit market turmoil and our below investment grade credit ratings may also make it more difficult and expensive to refinance our maturing debt 
as of december   we have approximately million and million of debt maturing in and  respectively 
the consummation of the verizon transaction would result in a combined company with significantly larger business operations and  consequently  greater working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs 
upon consummation of the verizon transaction  we will be assuming approximately billion of spinco debt 
as a result of the greater liquidity requirements of the combined company  it is anticipated that we will seek to expand our revolving credit facility in order to ensure that the combined company has sufficient flexibility to meet its liquidity needs 
in addition  the company may need or elect to raise capital in order to finance or pre fund commitments which may be made to governmental agencies in connection with their approval of the verizon transaction  including commitments with regard to capital expenditures 
in addition  if spinco with frontier s consent and participation chooses to raise all or a portion of the financing required to complete the verizon transaction prior to the closing of the verizon transaction  and the verizon transaction is ultimately not consummated or is delayed for a significant period of time  we could be obligated to pay significant interest expense and other costs in connection with the financing without ever achieving the expected benefits of the verizon transaction  which may impact our liquidity 
assuming the verizon transaction closes  based on the lower level of spinco debt we will be assuming from spinco relative to spinco s projected operating cash flows  the combined company s overall debt will increase but its capacity to service the debt will be significantly enhanced as compared to frontier s capacity today 
at december   the ratio of frontier s net debt to operating cash flow leverage ratio was times 
it is expected that the combined company s leverage ratio will be significantly lower at closing 
cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow provided by operating activities improved million for as compared to cash flow provided by operating activities declined million  or  for as compared to the decline resulted from a drop in operating income  as adjusted for non cash items  lower investment income  a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in current income tax expenditures 
these declines were partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable that positively impacted our cash position as compared to the prior year 
we paid million in cash taxes during cash paid for taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our cash taxes were lower than and reflect the benefits from accelerated tax depreciation arising from the american recovery and reinvestment act arra  utilization of amt credits and higher interest expense arising from our debt offerings not fully offset by debt repurchases 
we expect that in our cash taxes will be less than million 
we expect that our cash taxes will be reduced by the receipt of tax refunds arising from the retroactive application of a change in tax accounting for repairs and maintenance costs 
in addition  our cash taxes will be impacted by approximately million of tax benefits arising from our integration activities and secondarily  our debt refinancing activities 
absent the tax benefits generated by these integration and refinancing activities  we estimate that cash taxes would be approximately million to million in in connection with the pending verizon transaction  the company commenced activities during to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  plan and implement systems conversions and begin other initiatives necessary to effectuate the closing  which is expected to occur during the second quarter of  and enable the combined company to implement its go to market strategy at closing 
as a result  the company incurred million of acquisition and integration costs and million in capital expenditures related to verizon integration activities in while the company continues to evaluate certain other expenses  we currently expect to incur operating expenses and capital expenditures of approximately million and million  respectively  in related to these integration activities 
cash flow used by investing activities acquisitions on march   we acquired commonwealth in a cash and stock taxable transaction  for a total consideration of approximately billion 
we paid million in cash million net  after cash acquired and issued our common stock with a value of approximately million

capital expenditures in  and  our capital expenditures were million including million of verizon integration related capital expenditures  million and million  respectively 
we continue to closely scrutinize all of our capital projects  emphasize return on investment and focus our capital expenditures on areas and services that have the greatest opportunities with respect to revenue growth and cost reduction 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million to million for related to our currently owned properties  and an additional million of capital expenditures related to the integration activities of the pending verizon transaction 
cash flow used by and provided from financing activities issuance of debt securities on october   we completed a registered debt offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due the issue price was of the principal amount of the notes  and we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses

on march   we issued in a private placement an aggregate million principal amount of senior notes due and million principal amount of senior notes due proceeds from the sale were used to pay down in full million principal amount of indebtedness borrowed on march  under a bridge loan facility in connection with the acquisition of commonwealth  and to redeem  on april   million principal amount of our senior notes due in the second quarter of  we completed an exchange offer to publicly register the debt for the million in total of private placement notes described above  in addition to the million principal amount of senior notes due issued in a private placement on december   for registered notes

during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased and retired  in accordance with the terms of the tender offer referred to above  approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes and approximately million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the aggregate consideration for these debt repurchases was million  which was financed with the proceeds of the october debt offering and a portion of the proceeds of the april debt offering  each as described above 
the repurchases in the tender offer resulted in a loss on the early retirement of debt of approximately million  which we recognized in the fourth quarter of in addition to the debt tender offer  we used million of the april debt offering proceeds to repurchase in million principal amount of debt  consisting of million of the notes  million of our senior notes due january   million of the notes  million of our senior notes due march  and million of our debentures due august  an additional million net gain was recognized and included in other income loss  net in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  as a result of these other debt repurchases 
as a result of these debt transactions described above  as of december   we had reduced our debt maturities through to approximately million maturing in  million maturing in  million maturing in and million maturing in we do not expect the verizon transaction to change the amount of these near term debt maturities

divestitures on august   our board of directors approved a plan to divest our public utilities services businesses  which included gas  electric and water and wastewater businesses 
we have sold all of these properties 
in  we disposed of eli  our former clec business 
all of the agreements relating to the sales provide that we will indemnify the buyer against certain liabilities typically liabilities relating to events that occurred prior to sale  including environmental liabilities  for claims made by specified dates and that exceed threshold amounts specified in each agreement see note 
critical accounting policies and estimates we review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustment prior to their publication 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements  accordingly  it is possible that actual results could differ from those estimates and changes to estimates could occur in the near term 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and judgments are used when accounting for allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets  depreciation and amortization  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  contingencies and purchase price allocations  among others 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to such estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debts based on our estimate of collectability of our accounts receivable through a review of aging categories and specific customer accounts 
in and  we had no critical estimates related to telecommunications bankruptcies 
asset impairment in and  we had no critical estimates related to asset impairments 
intangibles our indefinite lived intangibles consist of goodwill and trade name  which resulted from the purchase of ilec properties 
we test for impairment of these assets annually  or more frequently  as circumstances warrant 
we reorganized our management and operating structure during the first quarter of to include our rochester market with our existing new york state properties and the rest of the east region 
this structure is consistent with how our chief operating decision makers ceo  cfo  coo review our results on a daily  weekly and monthly basis 
as a result of the change  our operating segments reporting units decreased from at december  to effective as of march  
after making the change in our operating segments  we reviewed our goodwill impairment test by comparing the ebitda multiples for each reporting unit to their carrying values noting that no impairment indicator was present 
further  we determined that no impairment was indicated at december  and march  for either the east or rochester reporting units and combining them did not alter the conclusion at either date 
no potential impairment was indicated and no further analysis was deemed necessary 
all of our ilec properties share similar economic characteristics and as a result  we aggregate our three operating segments into one reportable segment 
in determining fair value of goodwill during we compared the net book value of the reporting units to current trading multiples of ilec properties as well as trading values of our publicly traded common stock 
additionally  we utilized a range of prices to gauge sensitivity 
our test determined that fair value exceeded book value of goodwill for each of our reporting units as of december  goodwill by reporting unit operating segment at december  is as follows reporting units in thousands east west central goodwill we did not have any changes to our operating segments  reporting units  or changes in the allocation of goodwill by reporting unit during the years ended december  and during the first quarter of we acquired commonwealth and included their operations and any related goodwill in our central region 
each of the above noted reporting units is an operating segment 
the first step in the goodwill impairment test compares the carrying value of net assets of the reporting unit to its fair value 
the result of this first step indicated that fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of such reporting units by a wide margin 
as a result  the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required 
we estimate fair value in two ways market or transaction based and equity based utilizing our share price 
market values for rural ilec properties are typically quoted as a multiple of cash flow or ebitda 
marketplace transactions and analyst reports support a range of values around a multiple of to times annualized ebitda 
for the purpose of the goodwill impairment test we define ebitda as operating income plus depreciation and amortization 
we determined the fair value estimates using times ebitda but also used lower ebitda multiples to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess of fair value over the carrying values of the reporting units 
additionally  a second test was performed using our public market equity value or market capitalization 
market capitalization current market stock price times total shares outstanding is a public market indicator of equity value and is useful in corroborating the times ebitda valuation because we are singularly engaged in rural ilec operating activities 
our stock price on december  was and when compared to the fair value using the ebitda multiple obtained above  exceeded such value before consideration of any applicable control premium 
we also used lower per share stock prices to gauge the sensitivity of the estimate and its effect on the margin of excess fair value over the carrying value 
total market capitalization determined in this manner is then allocated to the reporting units based upon each unit s relative share of consolidated ebitda 
our method of determining fair value has been consistently applied for the three years ending december  depreciation and amortization the calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic useful lives of the underlying property  plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets 
an independent study updating the estimated remaining useful lives of our property  plant and equipment assets is performed annually 
we adopted the lives proposed in the study effective october  our composite depreciation rate decreased from to as a result of the study 
we anticipate depreciation expense of approximately million to million for related to our currently owned properties 
we periodically reassess the useful life of our intangible assets to determine whether any changes to those lives are required 
pension and other postretirement benefits our estimates of pension expense  other postretirement benefits including retiree medical benefits and related liabilities are critical accounting estimates 
we sponsor a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering a significant number of our current and former employees and other postretirement benefit plans that provide medical  dental  life insurance and other benefits for covered retired employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents 
the pension plans for the majority of our current employees are frozen 
all of the employees who are still accruing pension benefits are represented employees 
the accounting results for pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions applied in the determination of such amounts 
these actuarial assumptions include the following discount rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover  healthcare cost trend rates  expected retirement age  optional form of benefit and mortality 
we review these assumptions for changes annually with our independent actuaries 
we consider our discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets to be our most critical assumptions 
the discount rate is used to value  on a present value basis  our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date 
the same rate is also used in the interest cost component of the pension and postretirement benefit cost determination for the following year 
the measurement date used in the selection of our discount rate is the balance sheet date 
our discount rate assumption is determined annually with assistance from our actuaries based on the pattern of expected future benefit payments and the prevailing rates available on long term  high quality corporate bonds that approximate the benefit obligation 
in making this determination we consider  among other things  the yields on the citigroup pension discount curve  the citigroup above median pension curve  the general movement of interest rates and the changes in those rates from one period to the next 
this rate can change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields 
our discount rate was at year end  and at year end the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is applied in the determination of periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost as a reduction in the computation of the expense 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  we considered published surveys of expected market returns  and year actual returns of various major indices  and our own historical year  year and year investment returns 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of to in fixed income securities  to in equity securities and to in alternative investments 
we review our asset allocation at least annually and make changes when considered appropriate 
our asset return assumption is made at the beginning of our fiscal year 
in  we changed our expected long term rate of return on plan assets to from the used in for  we will assume a rate of return of 
our pension plan assets are valued at fair value as of the measurement date 
we expect that our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses for will be million to million they were million in  and that we will make a million cash contribution to our pension plan in no contributions were made to our pension plan during  or income taxes our effective tax rates in  and were approximately at the statutory rates

revenue revenue is generated primarily through the provision of local  network access  long distance  and data and internet services 
such revenues are generated through either a monthly recurring fee or a fee based on usage at a tariffed rate and revenue recognition is not dependent upon significant judgments by management  with the exception of a determination of a provision for uncollectible amounts 
consolidated revenue for decreased million  or  to  million as compared to this decline is a result of lower local services revenue  switched access revenue  long distance services revenue and subsidy revenue  partially offset by a million  or  increase in data and internet services revenue  each as described in more detail below

excluding the additional revenue due to the one time favorable settlement in the first quarter of and the additional revenue attributable to the cte and gvn acquisitions in and  our revenue for the year ended december  declined million  or  as compared to the prior year 
this decline is a result of lower local services revenue  switched access revenue and subsidy revenue  partially offset by a million  or  increase in data and internet services revenue  each as described in more detail below 
change in the number of our access lines is one factor that is important to our revenue and profitability 
we have lost access lines primarily because of changing consumer behavior including wireless substitution  economic conditions  changing technology  competition  and by some customers disconnecting second lines when they add hsi or cable modem service 
in  we lost approximately  access lines net  or on an annual basis 
this represents an improvement in our rate of access line loss over  during which we lost approximately  access lines net or on an annual basis 
we believe this improvement is attributable to the customer recognition of the value of our product bundles  fewer residential moves out of territory  fewer moves by businesses to competitors and our ability to compete with cable telephony in a maturing marketplace 
economic conditions and or increasing competition could make it more difficult to sell our bundles  and cause us to increase our promotions and or lower our prices for our products and services  which would adversely affect our revenue  profitability and cash flow 
during  we added approximately  hsi subscribers 
we expect to continue to increase hsi subscribers in although not enough to offset the expected continued loss in access lines 
while the number of access lines is an important metric to gauge certain revenue trends  it is not necessarily the best or only measure to evaluate our business 
management believes that customer counts and understanding different components of revenue is most important 
for this reason  presented in the table titled other financial and operating data below is a breakdown that presents residential customer counts  average monthly revenue  percentage of customers on price protection plans and churn 
it also categorizes revenue into customer revenue residential and business and regulatory revenue switched access and subsidy revenue 
despite the decline in residential customers and the decline in total access lines  our customer revenue  which is all revenue except switched access and subsidy revenue  declined in by percent as compared to the prior year period 
the average monthly residential and total customer revenue per customer has improved  and resulted in an increased wallet share 
a substantial further loss of customers and access lines  combined with increased competition and the other factors discussed herein may cause our revenue  profitability and cash flows to decrease in other financial and operating data as of increase as of increase as of december  decrease december  decrease december  access lines residential business total access lines high speed internet subscribers video subscribers for the year ended december  increase increase increase increase decrease decrease decrease decrease revenue in s residential business total customer revenue regulatory access services total revenue switched access minutes of use in millions average monthly total revenue per access line average monthly customer revenue per access line as of as of december  december  residential customer metrics customers revenue in s average monthly residential customer revenue per customer percent of customers on price protection plans customer monthly churn products per residential customer for the year ended december   the calculation includes cte and gvn data and excludes the million favorable one time impact from the first quarter settlement of a switched access dispute

access services access services revenue for decreased million  or  to million as compared with switched access revenue in of million decreased million  or  as compared with  primarily due to the impact of a decline in minutes of use related to access line losses and the displacement of minutes of use by wireless  email and other communications services 
access services revenue includes subsidy payments we receive from federal and state agencies  including surcharges billed to customers that are remitted to the fcc 
subsidy revenue  including surcharges billed to customers  for of million decreased million  or  as compared with  primarily due to lower receipts under the federal high cost fund fhcf program resulting from our reduced cost structure and an increase in the program s national average cost per local loop nacpl used by the fcc to allocate funds among all recipients

excluding the impact of that one time favorable settlement in  our switched access revenue for declined by million  or from subsidy revenue for  excluding the additional subsidy revenue attributable to the cte and gvn acquisitions in and  decreased million  or  in to million  as compared to  primarily due to lower receipts under the fhcf program resulting from our reduced cost structure and an increase in the program s nacpl used by the fcc to allocate funds among all recipients 
subsidy revenue in was also negatively impacted by million in unfavorable adjustments resulting from audits of the fhcf program 
many factors may lead to further increases in the nacpl  thereby resulting in decreases in our federal subsidy revenue in the future 
the fcc and state regulatory agencies are currently considering a number of proposals for changing the manner in which eligibility for federal subsidies is determined as well as the amounts of such subsidies 
on may   the fcc issued an order to cap competitive eligible telecommunications companies cetc receipts from the high cost federal universal service fund 
in  the federal court upheld the fcc s order and the cap remains in place pending any future reform 
the fcc is considering proposals that may significantly change interstate  intrastate and local intercarrier compensation and would revise the federal universal service funding and disbursement mechanisms 
when and how these proposed changes will be addressed are unknown and  accordingly  we are unable to predict the impact of future changes on our results of operations 
however  future reductions in our subsidy and access revenues will directly affect our profitability and cash flows as those regulatory revenues do not have associated variable expenses 
certain states have open proceedings to address reform to intrastate access charges and other intercarrier compensation 
we cannot predict when or how these matters will be decided or the effect on our subsidy or access revenues 
in addition  we have been approached by  and or are involved in formal state proceedings with  various carriers seeking reductions in intrastate access rates in certain states 
long distance services long distance services revenue for decreased million  or  to million as compared with  primarily due to a reduction in the overall minutes of use and a reduction in the average revenue per minute of use 
we expect our long distance services revenue to continue to trend downward 
we have actively marketed a package of unlimited long distance minutes with our digital phone and state unlimited bundled service offerings 
these offerings have resulted in an increase in long distance customers  and an increase in the minutes used by these customers 
this has lowered our overall average rate per minute billed 
while these package offerings have grown our long distance customer base  those customers who still pay on a per minute of use basis have reduced their calling volumes 
long distance services revenue for increased million  or  to million as compared to long distance services revenue for increased million as a result of the cte and gvn acquisitions  and legacy frontier operations decreased million  or  as compared to during  we actively marketed a package of unlimited long distance minutes with our digital phone and state unlimited bundled service offerings 
our long distance services revenue may decrease in the future due to further declines in minutes of use or increased penetration of our unlimited calling packages 
competing services such as wireless  voip and cable telephony are resulting in a loss of customers  minutes of use and further declines in the rates we charge our customers 
we expect these factors will continue to adversely affect our long distance revenue in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure of primary market risks and how they are managed we are exposed to market risk in the normal course of our business operations due to ongoing investing and funding activities  including those associated with our pension assets 
market risk refers to the potential change in fair value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a result  we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to market risks  and we are not party to any market risk management agreements other than in the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk and equity price risk as follows interest rate exposure our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the interest bearing portion of our investment portfolio 
our long term debt as of december  was approximately fixed rate debt with minimal exposure to interest rate changes 
we had no interest rate swap agreements related to our fixed rate debt in effect at december  our objectives in managing our interest rate risk are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  all but million of our outstanding borrowings at december  have fixed interest rates 
in addition  our undrawn million revolving credit facility has interest rates that float with libor  as defined 
consequently  we have limited material future earnings or cash flow exposures from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
an adverse change in interest rates would increase the amount that we pay on our variable obligations and could result in fluctuations in the fair value of our fixed rate obligations 
based upon our overall interest rate exposure at december   a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on january   we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements representing million notional amount of indebtedness associated with our senior notes due in and cash proceeds on the swap terminations of approximately million were received in january the related gain has been deferred on the consolidated balance sheet  and is being amortized into interest expense over the term of the associated debt 
sensitivity analysis of interest rate exposure at december   the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be approximately billion  based on our overall weighted average borrowing rate of and our overall weighted average maturity of approximately years 
as of december   the weighted average maturity applicable to our obligations had been extended over the weighted average maturity as of december  by approximately years due to the debt offerings and refinancing activities that occurred during equity price exposure our exposure to market risks for changes in security prices as of december  is limited to our pension assets 
we have no other security investments of any material amount 
during and  the diminished availability of credit and liquidity in the united states and throughout the global financial system has resulted in substantial volatility in financial markets and the banking system 
these and other economic events have had an adverse impact on investment portfolios 
the decline in the value of our pension plan assets during resulted in an increase in our pension expense in the company s pension plan assets have increased from million at december  to million at december   an increase of million  or 
this increase is a result of positive investment returns of million  or  partially offset by ongoing benefit payments of million  or  during we expect that we will make a million cash contribution to our pension plan in
