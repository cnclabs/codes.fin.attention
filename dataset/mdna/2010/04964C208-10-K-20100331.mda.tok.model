executive overview as a direct to consumer internet marketing company  our strategy is to maximize the value of each media impression by maximizing the revenue and profit from each visitor to our media network 
we do this by using proprietary technology to match each consumer touch point visit  registration or lead submission with the highest value offer or series of offers 
these offers are sourced from a large pool of advertisers or from our own portfolio of consumer subscription products 
we also engage in targeted performance marketing activities where we focus on acquiring customers for an advertiser on an exclusive basis 
our premium subscription products  which are marketed directly to consumers  are an important component of the maximization strategy 
by maintaining alternatives to third party offers  we are able to make use of a larger proportion of acquired internet traffic and leads generated than would be the case with only third party advertisers offerings  since our owned products typically provide a higher effective value for each media impression 
over an extended period of time  our ability to generate incremental revenues relies on our ability to increase the size and scope of our media network  our ability to target campaigns  and our ability to convert qualified leads into appropriate revenue generating opportunities  including into subscribers of our own products 
revenue growth also depends on our ability to market and sell our services  including search services and lead generation activities  to third parties 
we combine our direct response capability with an internet based customer acquisition model  which allows us to use proprietary lead generation  search and email marketing strategies  to generate a greater volume of internet traffic at a lower effective cost of acquisition 
our success at acquiring qualified customers at a low effective cost is due  in part to our portfolio of attractive web properties  content and licensed media 
this performance marketing media network ensures a continual base of subscribers to our subscription products  and also generates qualified traffic that is complementary to our third party advertisers 
our direct response marketing business principally serves two sets of customers 
corporate clients and third party advertisers transactional services use our products and services to enhance their online marketing programs 
consumers subscriptions subscribe to our services to receive premium content on the internet and on their mobile device 
each of these business activities transactional and subscription may utilize the same originating media or derive a customer from the same source  the difference is reflected in the type of customer billing 
in the case of transactional marketing services  the billing is generally carried out on a service fee  percentage  or on a performance basis 
for subscription services  the end user the consumer is able to access premium content and in return is charged a recurring monthly fee to a credit card  mobile phone  or land line phone 
in managing our business  we internally develop programming or partner with online content providers to match users with our service offerings and those of our advertising clients 
our prospects for growth are dependent on our ability to acquire content in a cost effective manner 
our results may also be impacted by economic conditions and the relative strengths and weakness of the us economy  trends in the online marketing and telecommunications industry  including client spending patterns and increases or decreases in our portfolio of service offerings  including the overall demand for such offerings  competitive and alternative programs and advertising mediums  and risks inherent in our customer database  including customer attrition 
similar to other media based companies  our ability to specifically isolate the relative historical aggregate impact of price and volume regarding our revenue is not practical as the majority of our services are sold and managed on an order by order basis and our revenues are greatly impacted by our ability to qualify  validate and enhance leads that we acquire 
factors impacting the pricing of our services include  but are not limited to the dollar value  length and breadth of the order  the quality of the desired action  the quantity of actions or services requested by our clients  our ability to enhance the value of leads through validation and traffic disaggregation  matching leads to the highest relative value offer  and the level of customization required by our clients 
the principal components of our operating expense are labor  media and media related expenses including media content costs  lead validation and affiliate compensation  product or content development and royalties or licensing fees  marketing and promotional expense including sales commissions  customer service and customer retention expense and corporate general and administrative expense 
we consider our operating cost structure to be predominantly variable in nature over a short time horizon  and as a result  we are immediately able to make modifications to our cost structure to what we believe to be increases or decreases in revenue and market trends 
this factor is important in monitoring our performance in periods when revenues are increasing or decreasing 
in periods where revenues are increasing as a result of improved market conditions  we will make every effort to best utilize existing resources  but there can be no guarantee that we will be able to increase revenues without incurring additional marketing or operating costs and expenses 
conversely  in a period of declining market conditions we are immediately able to reduce certain operating expenses and preserve operating income 
furthermore  if we perceive a decline in market conditions to be temporary  we may choose to maintain or increase operating expenses for the future maximization of operating results 
as a growing part of our direct to consumer business  the kazaa music service is an important focus for management 
the kazaa digital music service is offered in conjunction with bde  an online distributor of licensed digital content 
on march   we entered into a marketing services agreement the marketing agreement and a master services agreement the services agreement with bde effective as of july  collectively  the agreements  relating to the operation and marketing of the kazaa digital music service 
the agreements have a term of three years from the effective date  contain provisions for automatic one year renewals  subject to notice of non renewal by either party  and may only be terminated generally upon a bankruptcy or liquidation event or in the event of an uncured material breach by either party 
in accordance with the agreements  atrinsic and bde will share equally in the net profit generated by the kazaa music subscription service after all of our costs and expenses are recovered 
under the marketing agreement  we are responsible for marketing  promotional  and advertising services in respect of the kazaa service 
in exchange for these marketing services  we will be reimbursed for the pre approved costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of the services plus all other agreed budgeted amounts 
pursuant to the services agreement  we are to provide services related to the operation of the kazaa website and service  including billing and collection services and the operation of the kazaa online storefront 
bde is obligated to provide certain other services with respect to the service  including licensing the intellectual property underlying the kazaa service to us  obtaining all licenses to the content offered as part of the service and delivering that content to the subscribers via the service interface 
as part of the agreements  we are required to make advance payments and expenditures in respect of certain expenses incurred in order to provide the required services and operate the kazaa music service 
these advances and expenditures are recoverable on a dollar for dollar basis against future revenues 
bde has agreed to repay up to  of these advances and expenditures which are not otherwise recovered from kazaa generated revenues and this repayment obligation will be secured under separate agreement 
similarly  we are not obligated to make additional expenditures if more than  remains unrecovered or unrecouped by us from kazaa revenues 
business strategy to become a leading direct to consumer internet marketing company  our strategy is to continue to develop a broad marketing and media network that allows us to cost efficiently acquire consumers for our subscription based services and for our third party lead generation activities 
we also must continually develop best in class service offerings for our clients in the area of search related services 
expand online distribution capabilities we consider our distribution capabilities as encompassing the various ways we generate internet traffic by attracting users to various web properties and converting visitors into subscribers and third party leads 
we employ a multifaceted approach to generating traffic i users may navigate directly to our web properties  ii users respond to our email marketing  iii we garner users of our promotional and sweepstakes sites  iv we attract users to our content sites by offering valuable media and other content  v we utilize call center technology in the acquisition process  and vi we use search engine optimization and search marketing efforts which attract users to our sites and services on a ppc basis 
our strategy is to increase our volume of visitors  subscribers  and third party leads by improving the reach and widening our breadth of distribution 
we expect to do this by increasing our portfolio of web properties and sites  and improving existing  or employing innovative techniques  to source traffic 
we expect that by expanding our online distribution capability  we will lower our customer acquisition costs by improving margins through greater scale 
publish high quality  branded subscription content as a direct to consumer internet marketing company  we are focused on partnering with companies  and developing proprietary sources of content  for our direct to consumer subscription products 
we believe that publishing a diversified portfolio of the highest quality content  like the kazaa music service  is important to our business 
we intend to continue to develop innovative and sought after content and intend to continue to devote significant resources to the development of high quality and innovative products and services 
we will focus on subscription based products in the entertainment and lifestyle categories as these products correspond to the visitor base in our media network 
lead generation product development in order to be competitive in the performance marketing areas  companies must de commoditize the leads they generate 
we are pursuing a number of value enhancing strategies to increase the marketability of our leads to third parties and to increase the conversion of leads into subscribers of our direct to consumer subscription services 
these innovations include ad units designed to drive direct telephone calls  where a call center operator will respond instantly to a user s request for information and  in some instances  transfer the consumer directly to an advertiser 
we also actively increase the value of a consumer inquiry by validating the submission of online information through automated data lookups and validation  or through call center confirmation 
all of these lead value enhancement techniques assist us in increasing the average sales price of leads sold to our advertisers  or improves the conversion of users into subscribers to our direct to consumer subscription services and the corresponding increases in ltv that result from more highly qualified subscribers 
multiple billing platforms as a direct result of being proficient in multiple billing platforms  we are able to create customer acquisition efficiencies because we can acquire direct subscribers and generate third party leads 
this provides us with a competitive advantage over traditional direct response marketers  who may only offer a single billing modality credit cards 
we have agreements through multiple aggregators who have access to us carriers both wireless and landline for billing 
these relationships include our interest in tbr  which is an aggregator of fixed line billing 
in addition to agreements with aggregators  we also have an agreement in place with at t wireless to distribute and bill for our services directly to subscribers on their network 
as a result of our multiple billing protocols  we are able to expand our potential customer base  attracting consumers who may prefer a different billing mechanism than is traditionally offered 
many of our new product initiatives leverage and expand upon our alternative billing capabilities 
online marketing services in order to be competitive in the area of online marketing services  particularly in search related marketing services  we must continue to expand our staff and technology capabilities 
our product offering will not remain competitive if we don t offer our clients leading edge technology and strategies designed to drive their online sales efforts 
adding more services revenue will involve prospecting a targeted set of clients who are natural consumers of our services 
our initiatives include delivering an integrated suite of services  which include search engine marketing services  search engine optimization  display advertising  and affiliate marketing 
our ability to integrate brand protection and competitive intelligence is a source of differentiation and growth for our existing and new client base 
technology through our use of technology  we attempt to display the highest value offer to the consumer 
on a real time basis  our technology dynamically analyzes user data  media source  and estimated offer values and progressions to gauge which offer maximizes the value of the media impression 
if the user is qualified  we will expose one of our targeted consumer subscription offers 
in the event that the user does not correspond to our internal targeting criteria  the most profitable third party offers will be displayed 
in every case  we are continually working on technology to improve targeting capability so as to maximize the value of each media impression 
we also employ proprietary technology which measures  in real time  the effectiveness of our media buying by media source 
this allows us to adjust marketing efforts immediately towards the most effective partners 
these tools allow us to be more effective in our media buying  reducing our acquisition costs and improving convertibility and profitability 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues presented by type of activity are as follows for the year ended december for the year change change december  inc dec 
inc dec 
subscription transactional total revenues as described above  we currently aggregate revenues based on the type of user activity monetized 
our objective is to optimize total revenues from the user experiences 
accordingly  this factor should be considered in evaluating the relative revenues generated from our subscription and transactional services 
revenues decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  subscription revenue consists of content applications billed direct to consumers via mobile or land based telephone lines or credit card 
these services are delivered through the internet to pcs  or mobile phones  or through other internet connected devices 
subscription revenue decreased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in subscription service revenue was principally attributable to a decrease in the number of billable subscribers during the period 
at december  the number of subscribers was  compared to  at december  this also compares to  subscribers at september  the decrease in billable subscribers from a year ago was due primarily to a significant reduction in mobile customer acquisition rates  offset by approximately  net billable additions from the introduction of the kazaa music subscription service 
net billable additions refers to the number of subscribers added during the period  less attrition 
during  we reduced our mobile marketing spends  which directly impacted customer acquisition rates 
we elected to cut our mobile marketing spends because of the uncertain regulatory and legal environment associated with marketing mobile subscription services and due to the less profitable economics a result of higher customer acquisition costs of our mobile subscription service offerings 
transactional revenue is derived from our online marketing and lead generation activities  which are targeted and measurable online campaigns and programs for marketing partners  corporate advertisers  or their agencies  generating qualified customer leads  online responses and activities  or increased brand recognition 
transactional revenue decreased by approximately million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is principally attributed to the reduction in discretionary advertising spending by our search customers 
we also experienced weakness in our marketing services and lead generation business  including a reduction in page views  site visits  and registrations  which manifested itself in lower revenue for these service lines on a year over year basis 
as a result of the slow down in economic activity in the united states during  spending on advertising decreased markedly  leading to increased competition in the internet marketing and lead generation markets which  in turn  created significant downward pricing pressure on our offerings and resulted in a lower volume of registrations and leads that could be sourced at an attractive price 
operating expenses for the year change change december  inc dec 
inc dec 
operating expenses cost of media rd party product and distribution selling and marketing general  administrative and other operating depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill and intangible assets total operating expenses cost of media cost of media rd party decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of media rd party includes media purchased for monetization of both transactional and subscription revenues 
because of its strictly variable nature  this decrease was proportionately correlated to the decline in the related revenue 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of media rd party improved to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this improvement in cost of media rd party margin is attributable to reductions in the pace of mobile customer acquisition  partially offset by increased search marketing spend associated with the kazaa music subscription service 
it is to be expected that for businesses with a significant recurring revenue component  if direct marketing expense is significantly curtailed  the business  as a result of the recurring nature of revenue generated by the subscription service  will exhibit a short term period of improved cost of media rd party margins 
product and distribution product and distribution expense increased by million to million in the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  product and distribution expenses are costs necessary to develop and maintain proprietary content and support and maintain our websites and technology platforms which drive both our transactional and subscription based revenues 
in  we experienced higher product and distribution expense as a result of costs incurred to further develop the kazaa music service  greater royalty and license expense  also associated with kazaa  and other general marketing and distribution technology related expense 
these higher technology and royalty costs were offset by a reduction in product and distribution salary expense 
included in product and distribution cost is stock compensation expense of  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expense decreased by million to million in the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in salaries and other marketing costs  in accordance with the decrease in our revenue over the same period 
this decrease in selling and marketing expense was partially offset by higher customer service expense as a result of new service offerings and call center activity 
general  administrative and other operating general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due primarily due to a reduction in labor and related costs  professional and consulting fees  facilities and related costs  partially offset by an increase in sarbanes oxley consulting fees  legal expense and severance payments and accruals to former executives 
while we consider it important to make appropriate and modest investments in labor  facilities  and utilization of third party professional service providers to support our continued growth  business development  and corporate governance initiatives  management has also made steps to reduce our overall cost structure as a result of the challenging and competitive business environment  and the associated decrease in revenue and unfavorable operating results we have experienced over the last year 
we continue to look for opportunities to leverage our existing infrastructure or to generate appropriate cost savings without affecting employee morale or jeopardizing business development opportunities 
included in general and administrative expense is severance of million for the year ended december  and stock compensation expense of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  principally as a result of a reduction in capital expenditure and a decrease of million of ringtone subscriber database amortization expense from to the database was fully amortized by the second quarter of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets the company conducts its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of the year  unless an event occurs prior to the fourth quarter that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company below its carrying amount 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment testing conducted in the fourth quarter  and for the year ended december   we determined there was impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and recorded a non cash charge of million compared to an impairment charge of million in the goodwill and intangibles impairment  the majority of which is not deductible for income tax purposes  is primarily due to our declining market price  reduced expectations for future operating results and reduced valuation multiples 
such negative factors are reflected in our stock price and market capitalization 
loss from operations operating loss decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  excluding the effect of goodwill and intangibles impairment in and  operating loss increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the higher operating loss is the result of the revenue decrease  together with proportionately higher product and distribution expense  selling and marketing expense and general and administrative expense  offset by an improvement in the cost of media rd party margin 
interest income and dividends interest and dividend income decreased approximately  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the reduction is mainly due to a decrease in the balances of cash and marketable securities at december  compared to december   as well as a reduction in the rate of return on invested capital 
interest expense interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the interest paid is primarily related to the note payable to ringtone which was paid in january other income expense other income was  for the year ended december  compared to other expense of  for the year ended december  the expense was due to a loss on sale of marketable securities 
income taxes income tax expense benefit  before noncontrolling interest and equity in income of investee  for the year ended december  and was million and million  respectively and reflects an effective tax rate of and respectively 
the effective tax rates were computed taking into consideration non deductible impairment charges of million and million for and  respectively  and the establishment of an income tax valuation allowance of million for equity in loss of investee equity in income of investee was  net of taxes at december  and represents our interest in the billing resource  llc tbr 
we acquired the interest in tbr in the th quarter and the operating results were de minimis 
net loss income attributable to noncontrolling interest net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest was  for the year ended december  as compared to net income of  for the year ended december  this related to our investment in mecc which was dissolved in june net loss attributable to atrinsic  inc net loss attributable to atrinsic inc  decreased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources we continually project anticipated cash requirements  which may include business combinations  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and working capital of approximately million 
we used approximately million in cash for operations for the year ended december  and  contingent on prospective operating performance  may require reductions in discretionary variable costs and other realignments to permanently reduce fixed operating costs 
we generated million in cash from investing activities  principally from proceeds from sale of marketable securities and a distribution from the billing resource  offset by the investment in shopit 
cash used in financing activities was million and was principally attributable to repayment of the ringtone note payable of million and stock repurchases 
our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program which expired in may under this share repurchase program we purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to fund minimum working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
the extent of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our results of operations 
if our cash flows from operations is less than anticipated or our working capital requirements or capital expenditures are greater than expectations  or if we expand our business by acquiring or investing in additional products or technologies  we may need to secure additional debt or equity financing 
we are continually evaluating various financing strategies to be used to expand our business and fund future growth 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
the potential inability to obtain additional debt or equity financing  if required  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority and wholly owned subsidiaries and significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the equity method is used to account for investments in entities in which we have an ownership of less than and have significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the affiliate 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continually evaluates its estimates and judgments including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  useful lives of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  fair value of stock options granted  forfeiture rate of equity based compensation grants  probable losses associated with pre acquisition contingencies  income taxes and other contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
macroeconomic conditions may directly  or indirectly through our business partners and vendors  impact our financial performance and available resources 
such conditions may  in turn  impact the aforementioned estimates and assumptions 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounts receivable and related allowances the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses which may result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company bases its allowances on the likelihood of recoverability of accounts receivable by customer  based on past experience  the age of the accounts receivable balance  the credit quality of the company s customers  and  taking into account current collection trends 
if specific customer circumstances change or industry trends worsen beyond the company s estimates  the company would be required to increase its allowances for doubtful accounts 
alternatively  if trends improve beyond the company s estimates  the company would be required to decrease its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company s estimates are reviewed periodically  and adjustments are reflected through bad debt expense in the period they become known 
changes in the company s bad debt experience can materially affect its results of operations 
the company also makes estimates for refunds and provides for these probable uncollectible amounts through a reduction of recorded revenues in the period for which the sale occurs  based on analyses of previous rates and trends 
due to the payment terms of the carriers requiring in excess of days from the date of billing or sale  at its sole discretion  the company can elect to use trade discounts in order to facilitate quicker payment 
this discount or fee allows for payments of approximately of the prior month s billings to days after the end of the month 
the company records revenue net of that fee  if incurred  which is to of the associated revenue 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  the value assigned to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is not amortized to expense  but rather it is evaluated at least on an annual basis to determine if there is a potential impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than the carrying value 
if the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible is less than its carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
discounted cash flow analysis requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the company s businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the intangible asset valuation process include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows  the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  and the assessment of the asset s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset  including consideration of any technical  legal or regulatory trends 
the company has determined that there was an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets as a result of completing its annual impairment analysis as of december  in performing the related valuation analysis the company used various valuation methodologies including probability weighted discounted cash flows  comparable transaction analysis  and market capitalization and comparable company multiple comparison 
the results of this review and impact of the impairment are more fully described in note goodwill and intangible assets 
intangible assets subject to amortization primarily consist of customer lists  trade names and trademarks  and restrictive covenants that were acquired 
the intangible asset values assigned to the identified assets for each acquisition were generally determined based upon the expected discounted aggregate cash flows to be derived over the estimated useful life 
the method of amortizing the intangible asset values reflects  based upon the company s historical experience  an accelerated rate of attrition in the subscriber database based over the expected life of the underlying subscriber database after considering turnover 
accordingly  the company amortizes the value assigned to subscriber database based on the actual depletion of the acquired subscriber database 
the company reviews the recoverability of its finite lived intangible assets for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed by comparison to associated undiscounted cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of  and prior to asc evaluation  the company recognized an impairment of million under asc stock based compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with asc formerly financial accounting standard board statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised 
in estimating the grant date fair value at stock option awards and performance based restricted stock  we use the black scholes option pricing model and other binomial pricing models where appropriate 
the key assumptions for these models to derive fair value include expected term  rate of risk free returns and volatility 
if different assumptions and estimates were used  the amounts charged to compensation expense would be different 
revenue recognition the company monetizes a portion of its user activities through subscription based sources by providing on going monthly access to and usage of premium products and services 
in general  customers are billed at standard rates  at the beginning of the month  and revenues are recognized upon receipt of information confirming an arrangement 
the company estimates a provision for refunds and credits which is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
in determining the estimate for refunds and credits  the company relies upon historical data  contract information and other factors 
the estimated provision for refunds can vary from actual results 
the company effectuates its subscription revenues through a carrier or distributors who are paid a transaction fee for their services 
in accordance with asc formerly emerging issues task force eitf no reporting revenues gross as principal versus net as an agent  the company recognizes as revenues the net amount received from the carrier or distributor  net of their fee 
the company monetizes a portion of its user activities through transactional based services generated primarily from a fees earned  primarily on a cost per click basis  from search syndication services  b fees earned for the company s search engine marketing sem services  and c other fees for marketing services including data and list management services  which can be either periodic or transactional 
commission fee revenue is recognized in the period that the company s advertiser customer generates a sale or other agreed upon action on the company s affiliate marketing networks or as a result of the company s sem services  provided that no significant company obligations remain  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and the fees are fixed or determinable 
all transaction services revenues are recognized on a gross basis in accordance with the provisions of eitf  due to the fact that the company is the primary obligor and bears all credit risk to its customer  and publisher expenses that are directly related to a revenue generating event are recorded as a component of rd part media cost 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of financial accounting and reporting for income taxes required by asc formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under asc  deferred income taxes reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for tax purposes 
we maintain valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
effective january   the company adopted fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes subsequently codified under asc which resulted in no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
the company classifies interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense 
asc clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with asc and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
the first step is recognition  in which the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is measurement 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the u

the company is subject to federal  state and canadian examinations 
the statute of limitations for and in all jurisdictions remains open and are subject to examination by tax authorities 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if it had engaged in such relationships
