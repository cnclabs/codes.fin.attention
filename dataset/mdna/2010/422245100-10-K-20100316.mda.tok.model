we also maintain an extensive network of over  complementary and alternative medicine and chiropractic practitioners  which offers convenient access to the significant number of individuals who seek health services outside of the traditional healthcare system 
our guiding philosophy and approach to market is predicated on the fundamental belief that healthier people cost less and are more productive 
as described more fully below  our programs are designed to help keep healthy individuals healthy  mitigate and delay the progression to disease associated with family or lifestyle risk factors  and optimize care for those who are already affected by health conditions or disease 
first  our programs are designed to help keep healthy people healthy by fostering wellness and disease prevention through total population screening  health risk assessments and supportive interventions  and providing access to health improvement programs  such as fitness  weight management  and complementary and alternative medicine 
our prevention programs focus on education  physical fitness  health coaching  behavior change techniques and support  and evidence based interventions to drive adherence to proven standards of care  medication regimens and physicians plans of care 
we believe this approach optimizes the health status of member populations and reduces the short and long term direct healthcare costs for participants  including costs associated with the loss of health related employee productivity 
second  our programs are designed to drive healthy behaviors and mitigate lifestyle risk by promoting the reduction of lifestyle behaviors that lead to poor health or chronic conditions  and providing educational materials and personal interactions with highly trained nurses and other healthcare professionals to create and sustain healthier behaviors for those individuals at risk or in the early stages of chronic conditions 
we enable our customers to engage everyone in their covered populations through specific interventions that are sensitive to each individual s health risks and needs

our approach is to use proprietary  analytic models to identify individuals who are likely to incur future high costs without intervention  including those who have specific gaps in care that can be addressed to reduce disease progression and medical spending 
we recognize that each individual plays a variety of roles in his or her pursuit of health  often simultaneously 
by providing the full spectrum of services to meet each individual s needs  we believe our interventions can be delivered at scale and in a manner that reflects those unique needs over time 
we believe creating real and sustainable behavior change generates measurable  long term cost savings and improved business performance

we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies we describe our accounting policies in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap  which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in understanding the estimates and judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we generally determine our contract fees by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per member per month pmpm by the number of members covered by our services during the month 
we typically set the pmpm rates during contract negotiations with customers based on the value we expect our programs to create and a sharing of that value between the customer and the company 
in addition  some of our services  such as the silversneakers fitness program  are billed on a fee for service basis 
our contracts with health plans generally range from three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal  contracts with self insured employers  either directly or through their health plans or pharmacy benefit manager  typically have one to three year terms 
some of our contracts allow the customer to terminate early 
some of our contracts provide that a portion up to of our fees may be refundable to the customer performance based if our programs do not achieve  when compared to a baseline year  a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s healthcare costs and selected clinical and or other criteria that focus on improving the health of the members 
approximately of revenues recorded during fiscal were performance based and were subject to final reconciliation as of december  we anticipate that this percentage will fluctuate due to the level of performance based fees in new contracts and the timing and amount of revenue recognition associated with performance based fees 
some contracts also provide opportunities for us to receive incentive bonuses in excess of the cont ractual pmpm rate if we exceed contractual performance targets 
we generally bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due for the prior month s enrollment  which typically includes the amount  if any  that is performance based and may be subject to refund should we not meet performance targets 
deferred revenues arise from contracts which permit upfront billing and collection of fees covering the entire contractual service period  generally months 
contractually  we cannot bill for any incentive bonus until after contract settlement 
fees for service are typically billed in the month after the services are provided 
we recognize revenue as follows we recognize the fixed portion of pmpm fees and fees for service as revenue during the period we perform our services  we recognize the performance based portion of the monthly fees based on the most recent assessment of our performance  which represents the amount that the customer would legally be obligated to pay if the contract were terminated as of the latest balance sheet date  and we recognize additional incentive bonuses based on the most recent assessment of our performance  to the extent we consider such amounts collectible 
we assess our level of performance for our contracts based on medical claims and other data that the customer is contractually required to supply 
a minimum of four to six months data is typically required for us to measure performance 
in assessing our performance  we may include estimates such as medical claims incurred but not reported and a medical cost trend compared to a baseline year 
in addition  we may also provide contractual allowances for billing adjustments such as data reconciliation differences as appropriate 
in  we began participating in two medicare health support pilots  which concluded in january and july  respectively 
substantially all of the fees under these pilots were performance based 
our original cooperative agreements required that  by the end of the third year  we achieve a cumulative net savings total savings for the intervention population as compared to the control group less fees received from cms of 
under an amendment to our agreement for our stand alone medicare health support pilot in maryland and the district of columbia  we began serving a refresh population of approximately  beneficiaries on august   which was measured as a separate cohort for two years  by the end of which the program was required to achieve a cumulative net savings when comp ared to a new control cohort 
in april  we signed an amendment to our medicare health support protocol with cms  which changed the financial performance target for both the initial and the refresh populations to budget neutrality 
in late april  we received the final reconciliation report from cms independent financial reconciliation contractor 
based upon this final reconciliation report as well as our performance over the term of the pilots  we have recognized million of cumulative performance based fees related to these pilots and million of fixed fees 
at december   approximately million of performance based fees related to these pilots was recorded in contract billings in excess of earned revenue  million of which related to fees collected  and the remaining million of which related to fees billed but not collected due to cms withholding payment of these fees 
we submitted our objections to the fi nal reconciliation report and engaged in discussions with cms regarding our objections 
we  along with several other participating organizations in the medicare health support pilots  have submitted a proposal to cms to resolve the issues related to the reconciliation  however  such proposal remains subject to approval by the united states government 
if data is insufficient or incomplete to measure performance  or interim performance measures indicate that we are not meeting performance targets  we do not recognize performance based fees subject to refund as revenues but instead record them in a current liability account entitled contract billings in excess of earned revenue 
only in the event we do not meet performance levels by the end of the measurement period  typically one year  are we contractually obligated to refund some or all of the performance based fees 
we would only reverse revenues that we had already recognized if performance to date in the measurement period  previously above targeted levels  subsequently dropped below targeted levels 
historically  any such adjustments have been immaterial to our financial con dition and results of operations 
during the settlement process under a contract  which generally occurs six to eight months after the end of a contract year  we settle any performance based fees and reconcile healthcare claims and clinical data 
as of december   performance based fees that have not yet been settled with our customers but that have been recognized as revenue in the current and prior years totaled approximately million  all of which was based on actual data received from our customers 
data reconciliation differences  for which we provide contractual allowances until we reach agreement with respect to identified issues  can arise between the customer and us due to customer data deficiencies  omissions  and or data discrepancies 
performance related adjustments including any amounts recorded as revenue that were ultimately refunded  changes in estimates  data reconciliation differences  or adjustments to incentive bonuses may cause us to recognize or reverse revenue in a current fiscal year that pertains to services provided during a prior fiscal year 
during fiscal  we recognized a net increase in revenue of million that related to services provided prior to fiscal impairment of intangible assets and goodwill we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed an annual goodwill impairment test as of june  and concluded that no impairment of goodwill exists 
due to the recent change in our fiscal year end from august to december  the date of our annual impairment test changed to october beginning on october  we completed an annual goodwill impairment test as of october  and concluded that no impairment of goodwill exists 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and reconcile the aggregate fair value of our reporting units to our consolidated market capitalization 
the discounted cash flow model requires significant judgments  including management s estimate of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term growth rate for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
if we determined that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired based upon an impairment review  we would calculate any impairment using a fair value based goodwill impairment test as required by us gaap 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
except for a trade name which has an indefinite life and is not subject to amortization  we amortize identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired technologies and customer contracts  using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we assess the potential impairment of intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
we review intangible assets not subject to amortization on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we estimate the fair value of the trade name using a present value technique  which requires management s estimate of future revenues attributable to this trade name  estimation of the long term growth rate for these revenues  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value for the trade name 
if we determine that the carrying value of other identifiable intangible assets may not be recoverable  we calculate any impairment using an estimate of the asset s fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
accounting for income taxes requires significant judgment in determining income tax provisions  including determination of deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities  and any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets  and in evaluating tax positions 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
us gaap also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax ret urns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards based on estimated fair values at the date of grant 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment in developing assumptions  which involve a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and expected stock option exercise behavior 
in addition  we also use judgment in estimating the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
business strategy the world health organization defines health as not only the absence of infirmity and disease  but also a state of physical  mental  and social well being 
our business strategy reflects our passion to enhance health and well being  and as a result  reduce overall costs and improve workforce engagement  yielding better business performance for our customers 
our programs are designed to keep healthy individuals healthy  mitigate and delay the progression of disease associated with family or lifestyle risk factors  and optimize care for those who are already affected by health conditions or disease 
through our solutions  we work to optimize the health and well being of entire populations  one person at a time  domestically and internationally  thereby creating value by reducing overall costs and improving productivity for individuals  families  health plans  governments and employers 
we believe it is critical to impact an entire population s underlying health status and well being in a long term  cost effective way 
believing that what gets measured gets acted upon  in january  we entered into an exclusive  year relationship with gallup to provide a national  daily pulse of individual and collective well being 
the gallup healthways well being indextm is a unique partnership in well being measurement and research that is based on surveys of  americans every day  seven days a week 
under the agreement  gallup evaluates and reports on the well being of individuals of countries  states and communities  healthways provides similar services for companies  families and individuals 
to improve measurements like the well being index and thus enhance health and well being within their respective populations  our current and prospective customers require solutions that focus on the underlying drivers of healthcare demand  address worsening health status  reverse or slow unsustainable cost trends  foster healthy behaviors  mitigate health risks  and manage chronic conditions 
our strategy is to deliver programs that engage individuals and help them enhance their health status and well being regardless of their starting point 
we believe we can achieve health and well being improvements in a population and generate significant cost savings and increases in productivity by providing effective programs that support the individual throughout his or her health journey 
we are adding and enhancing solutions to extend our reach and effectiveness and to meet increasing demand for integrated solutions 
the flexibility of our programs allows customers to provide those services they deem appropriate for their organizations 
customers may select from certain single program options up to a total population approach  in which all members of a customer s population are eligible to receive benefits 
our strategy includes as a priority the ongoing development of an order of magnitude increase in our value proposition through introducing our wholehealth solution 
this solution  in addition to improving health and reducing direct healthcare costs  targets a much larger impact on employer profitability by lowering the costs of lost productivity due to health related reasons 
with the success of our wholehealth solution  we expect to gain a significant competitive advantage in responding to employers needs for a healthier  higher performing and less costly workforce 
our strategy also includes the further enhancement of our proprietary next generation technology platform known as embrace 
this platform  which is essential to our wholehealth solution  enables us to integrate data from all the healthcare entities interacting with an individual 
embrace enables the delivery of our integrated solutions and ongoing communications between the individual and his her medical and health experts  using any method desired  including venue based face to face  print  phone  mobile and remote devices  on line  emerging modalities  and any combination thereof 
we plan to increase our competitive advantage in delivering our services by leveraging our scalable  state of the art call centers  medical information content  behavior change processes and techniques  strategic relationships  health provider networks  fitness center relationships  and proprietary technologies and techniques 
we anticipate we will continue to enhance  expand and further integrate capabilities  pursue opportunities in domestic government and international markets  and enhance our information technology support 
we may add some of these new capabilities and technologies through internal development  strategic alliances with other entities and or through selective acquisitions or investments 
results of operations the following table shows the components of the statements of operations for the fiscal year ended december   the four months ended december  and  and the fiscal years ended august  and expressed as a percentage of revenues 
year ended december  four months ended year ended december  december  august  revenues cost of services exclusive of depreciation and amortization included below selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization impairment loss restructuring and related charges operating income gain on sale of investment interest expense legal settlement income before income taxes income tax expense net income figures may not add due to rounding 
revenues revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  over fiscal  primarily due to the following contract restructurings and terminations with certain customers  and decreased revenues related to our medicare health support pilots  which ended in january and july  respectively 
these decreases were somewhat offset by increases in revenues primarily due to the following the commencement of contracts with new customers  increased revenues from fitness center programs  primarily due to an increase in participation in these programs as well as in the number of members eligible for them  growth in the number of self insured employer lives under existing customer contracts  increased performance based revenues due to our ability to measure and achieve performance targets on certain contracts during fiscal  and increased membership in customers existing programs 
revenues for the four months ended december  increased million  or  over revenues for the four months ended december   primarily due to the following the commencement of new contracts  growth in the number of self insured employers on behalf of our health plan customers  and the addition of new programs or the expansion of existing programs into additional populations with existing customers 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues primarily due to contract restructurings and terminations with certain customers  program terminations by certain customers  and the loss by some of our health plan customers of their administrative services only aso employer accounts 
revenues for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of axia on december  the remainder of the increase is primarily due to the following the addition of new customers  new programs with existing customers  or the expansion of existing programs into additional populations with existing customers since the beginning of fiscal  and increased membership in customers existing programs 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues related to contract terminations and restructurings with certain customers 
cost of services cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for fiscal increased to compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following an increased portion of our revenue generated by fitness center and certain health improvement programs  which typically have a higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue than our other programs  the addition of certain participating locations to our fitness center network that have a higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue  contract restructurings with certain customers that resulted in either decreased revenues or lower per member fees without a proportional corresponding decrease in costs  and an increase in the level of employee bonus provision based on the company s financial performance against established internal targets during these periods 
these increases were somewhat offset by the following decreases in cost of services as a percentage of revenues a decrease in salaries and benefits expense  primarily due to a restructuring of the company that was largely completed during the fourth calendar quarter of and a decrease in health insurance costs related to changes in employee medical plan design in fiscal  which included a number of wellness initiatives aimed at improving employee health  and cost savings related to certain cost management initiatives 
during the three months ended december   there were no material changes in cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues from previous quarters during  except for a decrease in the level of employee bonus provision based on the company s year to date financial performance against established internal targets 
cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues increased to for the four months ended december  compared to for the four months ended december   primarily due to the following the completion of an offer to purchase from our employees  excluding the chief executive officer and board of directors  outstanding options to acquire shares of common stock of the company that were granted between september  and august  under our shareholder approved stock option plans the tender offer on december  the tender offer resulted in additional stock based compensation expense within cost of services of million  representing the remaining compensation cost for these options as measured at the grant date but not yet recognized prior to the completion of the tender offer  increased member utilization of fitness centers for contracts for which we receive a fixed fee per member  contract restructurings with certain customers  as noted above  that resulted in decreased revenues without a proportional corresponding decrease in costs  and increased costs related to information technology hosting security and storage for the four months ended december  these increases were somewhat offset by the following decreases in cost of services as a percentage of revenues decreased costs related to the two medicare health support pilots in which we participated  which ended in january and july  respectively  and cost savings related to certain cost management initiatives 
cost of services excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for fiscal increased to compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following an increased portion of our revenue growth generated by fitness center programs  which typically have a higher cost of services as a percentage of revenue than our other programs  and an increase in the level of employee bonus provision during fiscal compared to fiscal based on the company s financial performance against established internal targets during these periods 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenues due to decreased costs during fiscal related to the two medicare health support pilots in which we participated  which ended in january and july  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following a net increase in salaries and benefits expense  primarily due to the company restructuring in the fourth calendar quarter of  which included an increased focus on research and development activities  resulting in an increase in personnel dedicated to these activities that more than offset the reduction in headcount resulting from this restructuring and other workforce reductions  and an increase in the level of employee bonus provision based on the company s financial performance against established internal targets during these periods 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional consulting fees primarily related to product innovation and strategic and organizational design initiatives in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the four months ended december  compared to for the four months ended december   primarily due to the completion of the tender offer on december   which resulted in additional stock based compensation expense within selling  general and administrative expenses of million  representing the remaining compensation cost for these options as measured at the grant date but not yet recognized prior to the completion of the tender offer 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the following efficiencies from the integration of the axia acquisition  and our ability to more effectively leverage our selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of growth in our operations 
these decreases were somewhat offset by an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal related to relocating to and operating our new corporate headquarters during fiscal depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures of computer software  which we made to enhance our information technology capabilities  somewhat offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in september depreciation and amortization expense increased for the four months ended december  compared to the four months ended december   primarily due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures of computer software and hardware  which we made to enhance our information technology capabilities  and capital expenditures related to our new corporate headquarters 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets that became fully amortized in september depreciation and amortization expense increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures on computer software development  which we made to enhance our information technology capabilities  depreciation and amortization expense associated with the depreciable assets and identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with the axia acquisition on december   and increased amortization expense associated with patents which were acquired in august restructuring and related charges and impairment loss during the four months ended december   we incurred net charges of million related to a restructuring of the company announced in october  which primarily consisted of severance costs  net of equity forfeitures  and costs associated with capacity consolidation 
in december  we decided to discontinue offering one of our products as a standalone program 
as a result of this decision we did not renew the expiring trade name associated with this product and recorded an impairment loss of million during the four months ended december  to write off this intangible asset 
gain on sale of investment in january  a private company in which we held preferred stock was acquired by a third party 
as part of this sale  we received two payments totaling million in january and february and recorded a gain of million during the first quarter of interest expense interest expense for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in floating interest rates on outstanding borrowings under the third amended credit agreement during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense for the four months ended december  decreased million compared to the four months ended december   primarily as a result of a decrease in interest rates on outstanding borrowings somewhat offset by a higher average level of outstanding borrowings under the third amended credit agreement during the four months ended december  compared to the four months ended december  interest expense for fiscal increased million compared to fiscal  primarily related to increased interest expense during the three months ended november  compared to the three months ended november  due to borrowings under the third amended credit agreement related to the acquisition of axia on december  this increase was somewhat offset by a decrease in interest expense from lower average interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal legal settlement and related costs in march  our board of directors approved a settlement of a qui tam lawsuit filed in on behalf of the united states government related to the company s former diabetes treatment center of america business 
as a result of the settlement  which was effective as of april   we incurred a charge of approximately million  including a million payment to the united states government and payment of approximately million for other costs and fees related to the settlement  including the estimated legal costs and expenses of the plaintiff s attorneys 
income tax expense our effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to a relatively small base of pretax income for fiscal in relation to both the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives and certain non deductible expenses 
the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective tax rate are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes  the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives  and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate increased to for the four months ended december  compared to for the four months ended december   primarily due to a relatively small base of pretax income for the four months ended december  in relation to the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives  the impact of tax interest accruals  and the impact of certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal  primarily due to the impact of interest accruals related to unrecognized tax benefits included in our income tax provision for fiscal the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate of and our effective tax rate are due primarily to the impact of state income taxes  the lack of tax benefit on certain expenses incurred in international initiatives  the tax interest accruals described above  and certain non deductible expenses for income tax purposes 
outlook we anticipate that revenues for fiscal will likely decrease slightly compared to fiscal primarily due to contract restructurings and terminations with certain customers  program terminations by certain customers  and the loss by some of our health plan customers of their aso employer accounts  which will likely more than offset increases in revenue from higher fitness center participation and from new or existing customers 
notwithstanding the anticipated decrease in revenues in fiscal  we expect cost of services and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for fiscal to decrease compared to fiscal due to continuing operational efficiencies 
we anticipate depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal to increase over fiscal  primarily due to amortization of capitalized software costs related to our new integrated data and technology solutions platform 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources below  a significant portion of our long term debt is subject to fixed interest rate swap agreements  however  we cannot predict the potential for changes in interest rates  which would impact our variable rate debt  especially in light of current economic conditions that have created uncertainty and credit constraints in the markets 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal will decrease to a level consistent with that incurred during fiscal  however  we continue to evaluate the impact on our effective tax rate of both international operations and any future adjustments related to uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities for the year ended december  generated cash of million compared to million for the year ended august  the increase in operating cash flow resulted primarily from the following a decrease in income tax payments during fiscal primarily related to a smaller base of pretax income in fiscal  an increase in cash collections on accounts receivable for fiscal compared to fiscal due to the timing of cash receipts as well as an improvement in days sales outstanding  and a decrease in interest payments during fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in floating interest rates on outstanding borrowings under the third amended credit agreement 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in operating cash flow primarily related to the following payments during fiscal related to the aforementioned legal settlement and related costs and fees  payments during fiscal related to a restructuring of the company that was largely completed during the fourth quarter of calendar  which primarily consisted of severance costs and costs associated with capacity consolidation  and a higher amount of lease incentives received during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily related to our new corporate headquarters in fiscal investing activities during fiscal used million in cash  which primarily consisted of costs associated with software development  purchases of property and equipment associated with relocating one of our regional offices  and business acquisitions and investments  slightly offset by proceeds from the sale of an investment  described above 
financing activities during fiscal used million in cash primarily due to net payments on borrowings under the third amended credit agreement 
on december   we entered into the third amended credit agreement 
the third amended credit agreement provides us with a million revolving credit facility  including a swingline sub facility of million and a million sub facility for letters of credit  a million term loan facility  and an uncommitted incremental accordion facility of million

we currently meet the hedge accounting criteria under us gaap in accounting for these interest rate swap agreements 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities  our available cash  and our expected available credit under the third amended credit agreement will continue to enable us to meet our contractual obligations and to fund our current operations for the foreseeable future 
however  if our operations require significant additional financing resources  such as capital expenditures for technology improvements  additional call centers and or letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance to guarantee our performance under the terms of new contracts  or if we are required to refund performance based fees pursuant to contract terms  we may need to raise additional capital by expanding our existing credit facility and or issuing debt or equity 
if we face a limited ability to arrange such financing  it may restrict our ability to effectively operate our business 
current economic conditions  including turmoil and uncertainty in the financial services industry  have created constraints on liquidity and the ability of some entities to obtain credit from banks or in the capital markets 
we cannot assure you that we would always be able to secure additional financing if needed and  if such funds were available  whether the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us 
if contract development accelerates or acquisition opportunities arise  we may need to issue additional debt or equity to provide the funding for these increased growth opportunities 
we may also issue equity in connection with future acquisitions or strategic alliances 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to issue additional debt or equity on terms that would be acceptable to us
