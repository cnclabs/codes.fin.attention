item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements  including as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
see special note regarding forward looking statements appearing at the beginning of this report and risk factors set forth in item a of this report 
overview we are a leading north american designer and manufacturer of hopper and tank railcars 
we also repair and refurbish railcars  provide fleet management services and design and manufacture certain railcar and industrial components 
we provide our railcar customers with integrated solutions through a comprehensive set of high quality products and related services 
we operate in two segments manufacturing operations and railcar services 
manufacturing operations consist of railcar manufacturing as well as railcar and industrial component manufacturing 
railcar services consist of railcar repair and refurbishment services and fleet management services 
the economic downturn is continuing to have an adverse effect on the railcar and other industrial manufacturing markets in which we compete  resulting in substantially reduced orders in the marketplace  increased competition for those fewer orders  increased pricing pressures and lower revenues 
consistent with this market wide trend  sales of our railcars and other products were adversely affected and we received no new railcar orders during  which caused us to further slow our production rates 
the economic downturn and the significant number of railcars we believe to be currently in storage are driving the low forecast for the industry of approximately  railcar deliveries in down from approximately  railcar deliveries in and  railcar deliveries in  as reported by an independent third party industry analyst 
the availability of these stored railcars to be brought back into service would  we believe  delay a recovery in railcar orders following an economic revival 
moreover  we believe restricted credit markets may be making it more costly for purchasers of railcars to obtain financing on reasonable terms  if at all 
as a result of these current market conditions  our backlog has been declining significantly and we estimate that approximately of our december   backlog will be converted to revenues during we expect our shipments and revenues to significantly decrease in from in response  we have reduced production rates and workforce at our manufacturing facilities and continue to evaluate our capacity and production schedules 
if we are unable to obtain significant new orders  we will be required to further curtail our manufacturing operations 
we continue to monitor expenses in an effort to reduce overhead costs at all of our locations 
our railcar services segment has experienced growth primarily through expansion projects  which have generated higher volumes 
these higher volumes along with our seasoned workforce have generated additional efficiencies in completing repair projects 
in addition  one of our railcar manufacturing facilities utilized a portion of its capacity and highly skilled labor force to perform certain repair projects in we plan to continue to utilize available capacity at these facilities for certain repair projects in 
table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our historical operations as a percentage of revenues for the periods shown 
our historical results are not necessarily indicative of operating results that may be expected in the future 
years ended december  revenues manufacturing operations railcar services total revenues cost of revenue manufacturing operations railcar services total cost of revenue gross profit selling  administrative and other expenses earnings from operations interest income interest expense other income loss earnings from joint venture earnings before income tax expense income tax expense net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our revenues in decreased to million from million in this decrease was attributable to a decrease in revenues from manufacturing operations partially offset by an increase in revenues from railcar services 
our manufacturing operations revenues decreased to million in from million in the primary reasons for the decrease in revenues were decreased railcar shipments due to weak demand and a decrease in surcharges reflected in selling prices  partially offset by a change in product mix 
during  we decreased our workforce and production rates at our manufacturing plants due to reduced demand resulting in lower shipments 
our shipments in were approximately  railcars as compared to approximately  railcars in approximately of the shipments in were related to our railcar manufacturing agreement with acf  which generated million in revenues  as compared to approximately railcar shipments in  which generated million in revenues 
our agreement with acf terminated in march  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  our manufacturing operations revenues included million  or of our total consolidated revenues  from transactions with affiliates  compared to million  or of our total consolidated revenues  in these revenues were attributable to sales to a company controlled by mr

our railcar services revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to expansions at our railcar repair facilities and the railcar repair work performed at one of our railcar manufacturing facilities 
in  our railcar services revenues included million  or of our total consolidated revenues  from transactions with affiliates  as compared to million  or of our total consolidated revenues  in 
table of contents gross profit our gross profit decreased to million in from million in our gross profit margin increased to in from in the increase in overall gross profit margin was primarily driven by an increase in railcar services and effective cost management  all partially offset by a decrease in railcar shipments 
our gross profit margin for our manufacturing operations remained constant at for both and this was primarily attributable to fixed overhead cost control measures and strong labor efficiencies at most of our manufacturing locations offset by lower volumes 
our gross profit margin for railcar services increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to labor efficiencies  increased volume and a favorable mix of work 
selling  administrative and other expenses our selling  administrative and other expenses decreased in to million from million in these selling  administrative and other expenses  which include stock based compensation  were of total consolidated revenues in as compared to of total consolidated revenues in the decrease of million was primarily attributable to decreased workforce and other cost cutting measures partially offset by a legal settlement and an increase in stock based compensation expense of million 
the increase in stock based compensation expense was due to increased expense for our stock appreciation rights sars  which was driven by a trend of increasing stock price levels in as compared to a trend of decreasing stock price levels in interest expense and interest income net interest expense for was million  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense  as compared to million of net interest expense for  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense 
the million decrease in interest income from to was primarily attributable to lower interest rates 
the million increase in interest expense from to was due to a decrease in capitalized interest 
other income during  we sold corporate bonds we had invested in resulting in a realized gain of million partially offset by a million other than temporary impairment of our investment in gbx common stock and a realized loss of less than million on the sale of  shares of gbx common stock 
see further discussion of our short term investment activity in note to our consolidated financial statements 
loss earnings from joint ventures loss from joint ventures was million in as compared to earnings from joint ventures of million in in  due to weak demand  axis reported a net loss  of which our share was million and ohio castings reported a net loss  of which our share was million 
in  axis reported a net loss  of which our share was million and ohio castings reported net income  of which our share was million 
income tax expense in  we reported income tax expense of million as compared to million for the effective tax rate for was as compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to a one time million adjustment to accrued taxes due to certain tax benefits becoming recognizable during year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues our revenues in increased to million from million in this increase was attributable to an increase in revenues from both manufacturing operations and railcar services 

table of contents our manufacturing operations revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was partially attributable to the delivery of approximately more railcars in compared to the increase in shipments reflects the completion of our marmaduke expansion efforts and additional railcars shipped under our acf manufacturing agreement  partially offset by the decline in hopper railcar shipments in  due to less demand and increased competition for hopper railcar products 
manufacturing operations revenues also increased due to higher selling prices on most railcars caused by increases in surcharges that we were able to pass on to most of our customers 
during  we shipped approximately  railcars compared to approximately  railcars in for the year ended december   we recognized revenue of million related to railcars that were manufactured under the acf manufacturing agreement 
this agreement terminated on march  when we had satisfied our commitments under the agreement 
in  our manufacturing operations revenues included million  or of our total consolidated revenues  from transactions with affiliates  compared to million  or of our total consolidated revenues  in these revenues were attributable to sales of railcars and railcar parts to companies controlled by mr 
carl c 
icahn 
our railcar services revenues increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to strong railcar repair demand 
in  our railcar services revenues included million  or of our total consolidated revenues  from transactions with affiliates  as compared to million  or  in we have had a reduction in the scope of fleet management services that we are providing to arl 
since arl split from us in  arl has and continues to reduce these services 
this reduction has not affected the repair and maintenance services that we provide to arl 
we do not anticipate this reduction to have a material impact on its railcar services revenue 
gross profit our gross profit decreased to million in from million in our gross profit margin decreased to in from in the decrease in overall gross profit margin was primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit margins in our manufacturing operations 
our gross profit margin for our manufacturing operations decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower margins on hopper railcars as a result of competitive market conditions and increased material costs and surcharges on some hopper railcars that we could not recover through higher selling prices on fixed price contracts 
the increased material costs and surcharges that we were able to recover through increased selling prices on most railcars had a negative effect on gross profit margin  because we did not realize additional profit from these recoveries 
partially offsetting these costs were higher tank railcar shipments in along with favorable labor efficiencies and overhead cost control at our manufacturing facilities 
our gross profit margin for railcar services increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to labor efficiencies  increased capacity and a favorable mix of work 
selling  administrative and other expenses our selling  administrative and other expenses decreased by million in to million from million in these selling  administrative and other expenses  which include stock based compensation  were of total consolidated revenues in as compared to of total consolidated revenues in the decrease of million was primarily attributable to a decrease in stock based compensation expense of million resulting from decreased sars expense driven by our lower stock price levels in  which negatively affected the fair value of the sars 
in addition  income was recognized in from the reversal of expense for forfeited stock options 
the decrease in stock based compensation expense was partially offset by an increase in various other expenses in amounting to million mainly driven by increases in travel and other costs related to our recently formed joint venture and depreciation expense related to recently completed projects 
interest expense and interest income net interest expense for was million  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense  as compared to million of net interest expense for  representing million of interest income and million of interest expense 
the million decrease in interest income from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest rates and a decrease in average cash balances held in compared to due to cash invested in available for sale securities 
cash invested in generated a greater return than in 
table of contents the million increase in interest expense from to was due to interest expense on our unsecured senior notes  which had an additional two months of interest costs in compared to other income during  we purchased shares of gbx common stock and subsequently sold a portion of that investment resulting in a realized gain of million 
we also entered into total return swap agreements referencing  shares of gbx common stock 
during  all of these total return swap agreements were settled for a realized gain of million 
we also experienced gains on an option to purchase canadian dollars resulting in million of unrealized gain and million realized gain in loss earnings from joint ventures earnings from joint ventures decreased from million in to million in due to fluctuations in ohio castings and axis net earnings loss 
axis reported a net loss in  of which our share was million and ohio castings reported net income  of which our share was million 
in  axis reported a net loss of less than million and ohio castings reported net income  of which our share was million 
income tax expense income tax expense for was million  or of our earnings before income taxes  as compared to million for  or of our earnings before income taxes 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had net working capital of million  including million of cash and cash equivalents 
our cash position at december  consists of cash proceeds from our unsecured senior notes issued in february  net cash proceeds from our short term investment activity and cash generated from operations 
outstanding and available debt unsecured senior notes in february  we issued million of unsecured senior fixed rate notes  which were subsequently exchanged for registered notes in march the offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the terms of the notes contain restrictive covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt  issue disqualified or preferred stock  make certain restricted payments and enter into certain significant transactions with stockholders and affiliates 
these limitations become more restrictive if our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  is less than to as measured on a rolling four quarter basis 
as of december   and for the year then ended  we were in compliance with all of our covenants under the notes 
prior to march   we may redeem our unsecured senior notes in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus an applicable premium based upon a present value calculation using an applicable treasury rate plus  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
commencing on march   the redemption price is set at of the principal amount of our unsecured senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  and declines annually until it is reduced to of the principal amount of our unsecured senior notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from and after march  our unsecured senior notes are due in full plus accrued unpaid interest on march  revolving line of credit our million revolving credit facility with no borrowings expired in accordance with its terms on october  given our cash balance and after evaluating proposals for a new revolving credit facility  we elected not to replace the credit facility when it expired 

table of contents cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities are affected by several factors  including fluctuations in business volume  contract terms for billings and collections  the timing of collections on our accounts receivables  processing of payroll and associated taxes and payments to our suppliers 
our net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
net earnings of million were impacted by the non cash items including but not limited to depreciation and amortization expense of million  an impairment charge on short term investments of million  joint venture losses of million  provision for deferred income taxes of million  stock based compensation of million and other smaller adjustments 
we also adjusted earnings for the million of realized gains on the sale of short term investments 
cash provided by operating activities included a decrease of million of accounts receivable including those from affiliates and a decrease of million of inventory 
cash used in operating activities included a decrease of million in accounts payable including those to affiliates  a decrease of million of accrued expenses and taxes  an increase of million in interest receivable and an increase of million in income taxes receivable 
the decrease in accounts receivable and inventory was primarily due to decreased sales and production levels in as compared to inventory in also decreased due to improved management of and attention to inventory levels 
the decrease in accounts payable is primarily due to production slowdowns and the timing of payments in compared to the decrease in accrued expenses and taxes was primarily due to a decrease in accrued dividends and compensation along with income taxes receivable of million at december  compared to december  the increase in interest receivable is primarily attributable to loans to axis that were originated in compared to no loans to axis outstanding in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  this amount includes million of purchases of property  plant and equipment  equity contributions and loans of million to our ohio castings and axis joint ventures  a million cash outflow for the purchase of corporate bonds and a million cash inflow from our short term investment activity  including the sale of corporate bonds 
the million capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of equipment at multiple locations to increase capacity and operating efficiencies 
some of these purchases are described in further detail below under capital expenditures 
from time to time  we may invest in marketable securities  or derivatives thereof  including higher risk equity securities and high yield debt instruments 
these securities are subject to general credit  liquidity  market risks and interest rate fluctuations that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused overall tightening of the credit markets and the decline in the stock markets 
the market risks associated with any investments might have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
our investments at any given time also may become highly concentrated within a particular company  industry  asset category  trading style or financial or economic market 
in that event  our investment portfolio will be more susceptible to fluctuations in value resulting from adverse economic conditions affecting the performance of that particular company  industry  asset category  trading style or economic market than a less concentrated portfolio would be 
as a result  our investment portfolio could become concentrated and its aggregate return may be volatile and may be affected substantially by the performance of only one or a few holdings 
as of december   we had short term investments with a total market value of million 
capital expenditures we continuously evaluate facility requirements based on our strategic plans  production requirements and market demand and may elect to change our level of capital investments in the future 
these investments are all based on an analysis of the rates of return and impact on our profitability 
we are pursuing opportunities to reduce our costs through continued vertical integration of component parts 
from time to time  we may expand our business  domestically or abroad  by acquiring other businesses or pursuing other strategic growth opportunities including  without limitation  joint ventures 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  including costs that were capitalized related to refurbishment and replacement of existing assets and facilities  improvements for cost reduction purposes and expansion activities at our railcar repair facilities that were completed during 
table of contents future liquidity we believe that our existing cash balance of million will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our expected operating requirements over the next twelve months 
we expect our future cash flows from operations to be impacted by pricing pressures  the number of railcar orders and shipments and production rates along with the state of the credit markets and the overall economy 
our long term liquidity is contingent upon future operating performance and our ability to continue to meet financial covenants under our indenture and any other indebtedness we may enter into 
we may also require additional capital in the future to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions or other investments 
these capital requirements could be substantial 
our operating performance may also be affected by matters discussed under risk factors  and trends and uncertainties discussed in this discussion and analysis  as well as elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks  trends and uncertainties may also materially adversely affect our long term liquidity 
for  our current capital expenditure plans include approximately million of projects that we expect will maintain equipment  expand capacity  improve efficiencies or reduce costs  as well as fund investments in joint ventures 
this amount does not include our loan commitments to axis  which are discussed below under contractual obligations 
these capital expenditure plans include expenditures to further integrate our supply chain and various capital expenditures related to projects that have carried over into the amount set forth above is an estimate only 
we cannot assure that we will be able to complete any of our projects on a timely basis or within budget  if at all 
other potential projects  including possible strategic acquisitions that could complement and expand our business units  will be evaluated to determine if the project or opportunity is right for us 
we anticipate that any future expansion of our business will be financed through existing resources  cash flow from operations  term debt associated directly with that project or other new financing 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet existing financial covenants or obtain term debt or other new financing on favorable terms  if at all 
dividends during each quarter since our initial public offering in january until the second quarter of  we declared cash dividends of per share of our common stock to stockholders of record as of a given date 
the last dividend was declared in may and paid in july subsequently  in august  we indefinitely suspended our quarterly dividend payments and any decision to pay future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our operating results  strategic plans  capital improvements  financial condition  debt covenants and other factors 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect that these obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations senior unsecured notes interest payments on senior unsecured notes pension and postretirement funding total the operating lease commitment includes the future minimum rental payments required under non cancelable operating leases for property and equipment leased by us 

table of contents we entered into a contract in june to purchase the land and building of our la porte  texas facility that is currently being leased 
the lease expires on may  and at that time  we have agreed to purchase the property for million 
on february   we issued million of unsecured senior notes that are due on march  the interest rate on these notes is 
these notes have interest payments due semiannually on march and september of every year 
our pension funding commitments includes minimum funding contributions required by law for our two funded pension plans as well as expected benefit payments for our one unfunded pension plan 
our postretirement benefit plans are unfunded thus the participants and we must fund premium payments 
we have excluded from the contractual obligation table above  our gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits of million 
while it is uncertain as to the amount  if any  of these unrecognized tax benefits that will be settled by means of a cash payment  we do not expect any significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months 
during  we entered into two supply agreements with a steel supplier for the purchase of certain types of steel plate 
the agreements expire in and each agreement requires us to purchase a minimum volume requirement for the steel covered by that agreement at prices that fluctuate with the market 
we have no commitment under these arrangements to buy a minimum amount of steel  other than the minimum percentages  if our overall steel purchases decline 
in july  we entered into an agreement with axis to purchase new railcar axles 
we do not have any minimum volume purchase requirements under this agreement 
contingencies in connection with our investment in ohio castings  we have guaranteed bonds amounting to million issued by the state of ohio to ohio castings  of which million was outstanding as of december  we also have a guarantee on a million state loan that provides for purchases of capital equipment  of which million was outstanding as of december  the two other partners of ohio castings have made identical guarantees of these obligations 
we are subject to comprehensive federal  state  local and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment  the management  use  processing  handling  storage  transport or disposal of hazardous materials and wastes  or otherwise relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
these laws and regulations not only expose us to liability for the environmental condition of our current or formerly owned or operated facilities  and our own negligent acts  but also may expose us to liability for the conduct of others or for our actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time these actions were taken 
in addition  these laws may require significant expenditures to achieve compliance  and are frequently modified or revised to impose new obligations 
civil and criminal fines and penalties and other sanctions may be imposed for non compliance with these environmental laws and regulations 
our operations that involve hazardous materials also raise potential risks of liability under common law 
we are involved in investigation and remediation activities at a property that we now own to address historical contamination and potential contamination by third parties 
we are involved with a state agency in the cleanup of this site under these laws 
these investigations are in process but it is too early to be able to make a reasonable estimate  with any certainty  of the timing and extent of remedial actions that may be required  and the costs that would be involved in such remediation 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of this property prior to its transfer to us in by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
however  if acf fails to honor its obligations to us  we would be responsible for the cost of such remediation 
we believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that any noncompliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
we have also been named the defendant in a wrongful death lawsuit  nicole lerma v 
american railcar industries  inc the lawsuit was filed on august   in the circuit court of greene county  arkansas civil division 
mediation on january   was not successful and the trial has been scheduled for may  we believe that we are not responsible and have meritorious defenses against such liability 
while we believe it is reasonably possible that this case could result in a loss to us  we do not believe there is sufficient information to estimate the amount of such loss  if any  resulting from the lawsuit 
we are from time to time party to various other legal proceedings arising out of our business 
such proceedings  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources 
we believe that there are no proceedings pending against us that if the outcome was unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents axis loan our axis joint venture entered into a credit agreement in december effective august   we  through ari component and the other initial partner acquired this loan from the lenders party thereto  with each party acquiring a interest in the loan for million  the then outstanding principal amount of the portion of the loan we acquired 
the total commitment under the term loan is million with an additional million commitment under the revolving loan 
ari component is responsible to fund of the loan commitments 
the balance outstanding on these loans  due to ari component  was million of principal and million of accrued interest  both as of december  ari component s share of the remaining commitment on these loans was million as of december  see note for further information regarding this transaction and the terms of the underlying loan 
critical accounting estimates and policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates and assumptions are periodically evaluated and may be adjusted in future periods 
a summary of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of these policies involve a high degree of judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies  in management s judgment  are those described below 
if different assumptions or conditions prevail  or if our estimates and assumptions prove to be incorrect  actual results could be materially different from those reported 
revenue recognition revenues from railcar sales are recognized following completion of manufacturing  inspection  customer acceptance and title transfer  which is when the risk for any damage or loss with respect to the railcars passes to the customer 
paint and lining work may be outsourced to an independent contractor and  as a result  the sale for the railcar may be recorded after customer acceptance when it leaves the manufacturing plant and the sale for the lining work may be separately recorded following completion of that work by the independent contractor  customer acceptance and final shipments 
revenues from railcar and industrial components are recorded at the time of product shipment  in accordance with our contractual terms 
revenue for railcar maintenance services is recognized upon completion and shipment of railcars from our plants 
revenue for fleet management services is recognized as performed 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
we evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case  the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived assets may not be recoverable 
the criteria for determining impairment for such long lived assets to be held and used is determined by comparing the carrying value of these long lived assets to be held and used to management s best estimate of future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the long lived assets 
if the long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived assets exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets 
the estimated fair value of the long lived assets is measured by estimating the present value of the future discounted cash flows to be generated 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill recorded in conjunction with a past business acquisition  all allocated to our kennett custom railcar sub assembly plants reporting unit that is part of our manufacturing operations segment 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
whether an impairment of goodwill is required is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to their fair value  which is determined using a combination of methods  including management s best estimate of future discounted cash flows expected to result from the business 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is considered impaired and the impairment recognized equals such difference 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  there were severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity  which had significant adverse impacts on stock markets  which contributed to a significant decline in our stock price and corresponding market capitalization 
for most of the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization value was significantly below the recorded net book value of our consolidated balance sheet  including goodwill 
based on these overriding factors  indicators existed that we had experienced a significant adverse change in the business climate  which was determined to be a triggering event requiring us to review for impairment the fair value of the reporting unit associated with our goodwill 
we performed a goodwill impairment test as of december  and determined no impairment existed 
we also performed the annual impairment test as of march   noting no adjustment was required 
product warranties we record a liability for an estimate of costs that we expect to incur under our basic limited warranty when manufacturing revenue is recognized 
warranty terms are based on the negotiated railcar sales contracts and typically are for periods of up to five years 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of units sold and historical and anticipated rates of claims and costs per claim 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the adequacy of our warranty liability based on changes in these factors 
actual results differing from estimates could have a material effect on results from operations in the event that unforeseen warranty issues were to occur 
income taxes for financial reporting purposes  income tax expense is estimated based on planned tax return filings 
the amounts anticipated to be reported in those filings may change between the time the financial statements are prepared and the time the tax returns are filed 
further  because tax filings are subject to review by taxing authorities  there is also the risk that a position on a tax return may be challenged by a taxing authority 
if the taxing authority is successful in asserting a position different from that taken by us  differences in a tax expense or between current and deferred tax items may arise in future periods 
any such differences  which could have a material impact on our financial statements  would be reflected in the financial statements when management considers them probable of occurring and the amount reasonably estimable 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate for recoverability our deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as of december   we had approximately million in net deferred tax liabilities net of million of deferred tax assets 
at this time  we consider it more likely than not that we will have taxable income in the future that will allow us to realize our deferred tax assets 
as a result  no valuation allowance is currently recorded 
however  it is possible that some or all of our deferred tax assets could ultimately expire unused 
during  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes asc  which required us to record a liability related to unrecognized tax positions 
see our discussion of this in note in our consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement benefits pension and other postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
the primary assumptions include factors such as discount rates  expected investment return on plan assets  mortality rates and retirement rates  as discussed below discount rates the discount rate assumptions used to determine the december  benefit obligations and the expense amounts were and  respectively  for our pension plans and for our postretirement benefit plans 
we review these rates annually and adjust them to reflect current conditions 
we deemed these rates appropriate based on the citigroup pension discount curve analysis along with expected payments to retirees 

table of contents expected return on plan assets our expected return on plan assets for our funded pension plans of for is derived from detailed periodic studies  which include a review of asset allocation strategies  anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes  risks standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans asset mix 
while the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns  the assumptions are primarily long term  prospective rates of return 
mortality and retirement rates mortality and retirement rates are based on actual and anticipated plan experience 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our pension plans effect on december effect on pre tax  projected change in assumption pension expense benefit obligation in thousands decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate decrease in expected return on assets n a increase in expected return on assets n a the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for our postretirement benefit plan effect on pre tax effect on december postretirement service  projected change in assumption cost and interest cost benefit obligation in thousands decrease in discount rate increase in discount rate this sensitivity analysis reflects the effects of changing one assumption 
various economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
environmental we are involved in investigation and remediation activities at a property that we now own to address historic contamination and potential contamination by third parties 
we are also involved with a state agency in the cleanup of this site under these laws 
these investigations are in process but it is too early to be able to make a reasonable estimate  with any certainty  of the timing and extent of remedial actions that may be required  and the costs that would be involved in such remediation 
substantially all of the issues identified relate to the use of this property prior to its transfer to us in by acf and for which acf has retained liability for environmental contamination that may have existed at the time of transfer to us 
acf has also agreed to indemnify us for any cost that might be incurred with those existing issues 
we expect that we will be indemnified for these environmental matters 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not become involved in future litigation or other proceedings  or that we will be able to recover under our indemnity provisions if we were found to be responsible or liable in any litigation or proceeding  or that such costs would not be material to us 

table of contents stock based compensation the fasb asc  compensation stock compensation asc  requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards on their grant dates 
our share based awards include stock options  sars and restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of our equity instrument awards and other share based awards issued under the equity incentive plan 
the black scholes model requires estimates of the expected term of the equity award  future volatility  dividend yield  forfeiture rate and the risk free interest rate 
we estimate the expected term of all equity awards based on sec staff accounting bulletins official text topic d  which addressed the expected term aspect of the black scholes model 
it stated that companies that did not have adequate exercise history on equity instruments were allowed to use the simplified method prescribed by the sec  which called for an average of the vesting period and the expiration period of grants with plain vanilla characteristics 
these characteristics included service based vesting  instruments granted at the money along with certain other requirements 
both our stock options and sars have fair value estimates that are generated from the black scholes calculation 
this calculation requires inputs as mentioned above that may require some judgment or estimation 
we use our best judgment at the time of the grant to estimate fair value on the stock options to record the expense of those options over the vesting period of those options 
all sars granted are classified as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  given that they settle in cash  and thus  must be revalued every period 
as such  the fair value estimates on the sars we granted to our employees and directors are subject to volatility inherent in the stock price since it is based on current market values at the end of every period 
stock based compensation on all equity awards is expensed using a graded vesting method over the vesting period of the instrument 
as of december   all compensation costs related to stock options and restricted stock have been recognized 
as of december   unrecognized compensation costs related to the unvested portion of sars were approximately million and are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately months 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  amounts due to from affiliates and accounts payable approximate fair values because of the short term maturity of these instruments 
the fair value of long term debt is determined by the market close price

off balance sheet arrangements there were no off balance sheet arrangements in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to price risks associated with the purchase of raw materials  especially steel and heavy castings 
the cost of steel  heavy castings and all other materials used in the production of our railcars represents approximately of our direct manufacturing costs 
given the significant volatility in the price of raw materials  this exposure can affect our costs of production 
we believe that the risk to our margins and profitability has been greatly reduced by the variable pricing provisions in place with our current railcar manufacturing contracts 
these contracts adjust the purchase prices of our railcars to reflect increases or decreases in the cost of certain raw materials and components and  as a result  we are able to pass on to our customers any increased raw material and component costs with respect to the railcars we plan to produce and deliver during we believe that we currently have excellent supplier relationships and do not currently anticipate that material constraints will limit our production capacity 
such constraints may exist if railcar production was to increase beyond current levels  or other economic changes were to occur that affect the availability of our raw materials 
we hold available for sale investments that are reported at fair value as of the reporting date on our consolidated balance sheets 
the carrying values of available for sale investments subject to price risks are based on quoted market prices of the equity security as of the balance sheet date 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the settlement of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of an equity security may result from perceived changes in the economic characteristics of the issuer of the security  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
based on the balance as of december   we estimate that in the event of a decline in fair value of the gbx common stock  the fair value of our investment would decrease by million 
the selected hypothetical change does not reflect what may be considered the best or worst case scenarios 
indeed  results could differ materially due to the nature of equity markets
