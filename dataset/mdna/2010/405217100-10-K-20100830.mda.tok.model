the challenging economic environment of the last two years has affected consumer confidence  behavior and spending 
we have addressed these conditions by investing behind our brands to deliver value to consumers 
our results in the united states  canada and continental europe continued to reflect the strength of our brands and our focus on performance 
during the first three quarters of this fiscal year  we experienced significant inventory reductions initiated by two large distributors in north america  the impact of which we were able to partially offset with increased sales in other channels 
despite those initiatives on the part of our distributors  published independent syndicated consumption data consumption data measures sales scanned through cash registers at retail and similar information provided directly by retailers indicate that our consumption trends at certain retailers are improving 
we monitor consumption trends as part of the total mix of information used to evaluate expectations of future sales 
we improved profitability through productivity initiatives and we continued to manage our balance sheet to improve our cash flows 
our core grocery  snacks  tea and personal care brands continued to perform well despite the economic environment and our results at these reporting units continue to be profitable 
in europe we experienced losses as a result of a loss from operations in the united kingdom 
our sales in the united kingdom declined from the prior year primarily as a result of the phasing out of the supply of fresh sandwiches to marks and spencer  a major retailer 
we have partially offset this decline with increased sales of our frozen meat free linda mccartney brand and other private label products 
in addition  we acquired churchill food products  limited in the united kingdom at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal see recent development below  which we expect will provide us with additional sales volume 
the acquisition was initiated as part of our plan to return to profitability in the united kingdom  although there can be no assurances that this plan will be successful 
we are encouraged by the modest improvements we have begun to see in the economy and believe that we are positioned for sustainable growth with our established brands and our recent acquisitions 
however  we recognize that economic conditions may not fully recover and that we may also have challenges with respect to increasing input costs and therefore remain cautious 

table of contents recent developments acquisitions on june   we acquired substantially all the assets and business and assumed certain liabilities of world gourmet marketing  llc world gourmet  including its sensible portions brand snack products 
world gourmet develops  produces  markets and sells sensible portions branded garden veggie straws  potato straws and apple straws  pita bites and other snack products into various sales channels and has developed significant strength in the club store channel 
the acquisition of the sensible portions brand expands our snack product offerings as well as our sales opportunities in the club store channel 
on june   we also acquired churchill food products limited churchill  a manufacturer and distributor of food to go products in the united kingdom 
we expect that the acquisition of churchill will complement our existing daily bread brand by broadening our customer base for food to go products and expanding our product offerings  however there can be no assurances that our united kingdom operations will realize such benefits from the churchill acquisition 
on july   we acquired the assets and business of greek gods llc  including the greek gods brand of greek style yogurt

table of contents interest expense totaled million for the year ended june   which was primarily related to interest on the million of senior notes outstanding and interest related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility

included in other expenses for the year ended june  is a million non cash impairment charge for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in the shares of yeo hiap seng limited  a singapore based natural food and beverage company listed on the singapore stock exchange 
equity in earnings of equity method investees our share of the after tax loss from our investment in hpp was million for the year ended june  hpp s results for the year included approximately million of net loss related to its kosher valley brand 
hpp s profitable antibiotic free chicken and turkey results were more than offset by the losses incurred in the start up of the kosher valley brand 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  hpp divested its kosher valley brand in a transaction with empire kosher poultry  inc empire  wherein the kosher valley brand and customer relationships were exchanged for an equity interest in empire 
hpp recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million on the exchange

the impact of the united kingdom losses on the effective tax rate in fiscal was to increase it 
in fiscal  we had income tax expense of million and a pre tax loss of million 
the fiscal tax provision was impacted by impairment losses on intangible assets recognized  of which approximately million was nondeductible for tax purposes and which were treated as discrete tax items 
the fiscal and effective income tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the items noted above as well as the effect of state income taxes and the mix of pretax earnings by jurisdiction

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for the year ended june  were billion  an increase of million  or  over net sales of billion for the year ended june  our net sales in the united states increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
net sales in the united states excluding hpp increased  reflecting the strong performance of many of our core grocery and snacks brands 
our earth s best brand continued to grow at a double digit rate  along with increases across several other brands  including imagine soup  rice dream non dairy beverages  garden of eatin snacks  arrowhead mills flours and bake mixes  deboles pasta  spectrum naturals and rosetto frozen pasta 
we also had a full year of sales of the maranatha and sunspire brands  acquired in march these increases were partially offset by lower full year sales of our celestial seasonings tea brand and our personal care brands 
after recent years of slowing growth in tea  we focused on our core skus at celestial seasonings  which resulted in restarting consumption growth and producing increased shipments in this fiscal year s fourth quarter 
for the full year  celestial seasonings sales were impacted by foreign exchange rates and a change in promotional spending to increase the use of consumer coupons  the redemption of which is recorded as a reduction of sales  as well as reductions of inventory generally in the distribution and retail industries 
the recently implemented sku rationalization is expected to better position celestial seasonings to build on this improvement 
our sales of our personal care brands have been impacted by weakness in the drug store channel 
we have a full complement of new products for personal care  highlighted by the introduction of our rainforest skin and hair care products 
sales in the united states also included million of sales from hpp  an increase of million from sales of million in approximately of hpp s sales were conventional poultry  which carry lower margins 
hpp intends its future product mix to emphasize antibiotic free and kosher antibiotic free products  which it expects will return it to profitability

our international sales were million  accounting for of our consolidated sales 
our international sales were significantly impacted by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates  the discontinuation of a co pack agreement in the united kingdom and the phasing out of the supply of fresh sandwiches to a major united kingdom retailer 
the weakening of foreign currencies decreased reported sales by million  or 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended june  was million  a decrease of million  or  from last year s gross profit of million 
gross profit in fiscal was of net sales compared to of net sales for gross profit was impacted by million in fiscal and million in fiscal for sku rationalization  severance and other reorganization costs as we continued to focus on cost reduction and production efficiencies 
with the implementation in this year s fourth quarter of the sku rationalization of our celestial seasonings products and last year s personal care products sku rationalization and other reorganization activities  we believe we have positioned these brands for improved profitability and growth 
gross margin was also unfavorably impacted by increased sales at hpp  coupled with an unfavorable sales mix between antibiotic free and conventional product and severely decreased gross margins resulting from higher feed costs and lower market prices for conventional poultry 
hpp s gross margins declined in the current year  resulting in a basis point unfavorable impact on consolidated gross margin  and which was basis points greater than hpp s dilutive effect on fiscal consolidated gross margin 
we experienced an unfavorable impact related to under absorbed overhead at our fakenham frozen meat free facility as a result of the expiration of a co pack agreement with the former owner  impacting gross profit by approximately million  or basis points 
in response to the weakening economic conditions  we selectively increased the rate of our spending in fiscal on consumer coupons  advertising  promotional and other discounts in some of our markets to maintain sales  which had an basis point unfavorable effect on gross margin 
the increases in input costs we experienced at the end of last fiscal year and into the beginning of this year have begun to ease and have been offset by favorable pricing and productivity improvements

fiscal s expenses include a million charge to settle a personal injury litigation matter 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in the costs we incurred for professional fees related to the review of our stock option practices and defense of the related derivative lawsuits of million  including a million insurance reimbursement received 
restructuring expenses we incurred million of restructuring expenses in fiscal related to actions taken in several of our united states locations 
in fiscal  restructuring costs of million related to our personal care sku rationalization and reorganization were incurred 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles we recognized non cash impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles of million during the third quarter of fiscal the charges included million for goodwill  net of million attributed to the minority interest of our hpp joint venture  and million for other intangibles  as described below 
the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter 
in addition  if and when events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any of its reporting units below its carrying value  an interim test is performed 
the company completed its annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that no impairment existed as of the date of that analysis 
based upon a combination of factors including a sustained decline in the company s market capitalization below the company s carrying value during the fiscal quarter ended march   coupled with challenging macro economic conditions  the company concluded that sufficient indicators existed to require it to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis at march  accordingly  the company performed an interim first step of its goodwill impairment test for each of its then six reporting units 
for purposes of this analysis  our estimates of fair values were based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of each reporting unit based on the future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of the reporting units based on comparable market prices of each such unit 
the income approach requires that assumptions be made for  among others  forecasted revenues  gross profit margins  operating profit margins  working capital cash flow  perpetual growth rates and long term discount rates  all of which require significant judgments by management 
as a result of this step one analysis  the company determined that the carrying value of its protein and europe reporting units exceeded their estimated fair values  indicating potential goodwill impairment existed 
having determined that the goodwill of these two reporting units was potentially impaired  the company began performing the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis which involved calculating the implied fair value of its goodwill by allocating the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets and comparing the residual amount to the carrying value of goodwill 
accordingly  during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  net of million attributed to the minority interest of its hpp joint venture  to write off all of the goodwill related to its protein and europe reporting units 
the non cash charge had no impact on the company s compliance with debt covenants  its cash flows or available liquidity 
in april  the company was informed by the exclusive customer of its fresh prepared sandwich business in the united kingdom that the customer s purchases from the company would be significantly reduced in phases with reductions through april  after which the company could potentially supply certain specialty food to go products which are currently in a test phase with this customer 
the company performed an impairment test on the intangible asset associated with the customer relationship  which was being amortized 
the projected undiscounted future cash flows related to this customer relationship were determined to be less than the carrying value  and as a result  the company recognized a full impairment loss of million in the third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents operating income loss we had a loss from operations of million in compared to operating income of million in the decrease in operating income was primarily a result of the impairment charges for goodwill and other intangibles and the losses at hpp and in europe 
interest and other expenses  net interest and other expenses  net were million for the year ended june  compared to million for fiscal interest expense increased in fiscal to million from million in the prior year 
our interest expense was primarily related to the million of senior notes outstanding and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the increase resulted from interest on higher average borrowings for the first three quarters of the current year  partially offset by reduced borrowings in the fourth quarter and lower interest rates on the borrowings under our revolving credit facility during the second half of the fiscal year 
interest income on invested funds decreased to million from million in the prior year as a result of lower interest rates and reduced available cash 
we recorded approximately million of foreign currency losses during fiscal compared to million of foreign currency gains during fiscal we recognized a gain of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal on the sale of an equity interest in a joint venture which manufactures rice cakes in belgium 
income loss before income taxes we had a loss before income taxes of million in fiscal compared to income before taxes of million in the decrease is primarily attributable to the impairment charges for goodwill and other intangible assets and the losses incurred at hpp and in europe 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
our income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to million in the effective rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on factors including  but not limited to  the geographical mix of earnings  enacted tax legislation and tax audit settlements 
we had a negative effective tax rate in fiscal  wherein we recorded an income tax provision despite the loss before taxes as a result of a significant portion of the goodwill and intangible impairment not deductible for tax purposes 
our effective tax rate was in our effective tax rate in was higher than the united states statutory rate as a result of state income taxes and non deductible expenses  partially offset by a favorable mix of the company s income in foreign jurisdictions and a higher utilization of available foreign tax credits 
income loss attributable to noncontrolling interest hpp  which was a consolidated subsidiary until june   had a net loss for the year ended june  of which million was attributable to the noncontrolling interest 
for the year ended june   hpp reported net income  of which million was attributable to the noncontrolling interest 
net income loss we had a net loss of million  or per diluted share in fiscal compared to net income in of million  or per diluted share 
the decrease was attributable to the factors noted above 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations and growth primarily with the cash flows we generate from our operations and from both long term fixed rate borrowings and borrowings available to us under our new credit agreement 
our cash balance decreased million during the year ended june  to million as of june  our working capital was million at june   a decrease of million from million at the end of fiscal the decrease was due principally to a million increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities  a million decrease in other current assets and a decrease of million in cash and a million decrease in inventories 
our cash balances decreased primarily as a result of the repayments we made during the year on the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent 
as of june   all of our investments mature in less than three months 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities is summarized below 
years ended june  cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities exchange rate changes net decrease in cash net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended june   compared to million provided in fiscal and million provided in fiscal the increase in cash provided by operating activities in resulted from a million increase in our net income and other non cash items and a million increase due to changes in our working capital

we also used million of cash in investing activities in connection with capital additions

treasury stock increased by  shares million in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of stock surrendered to pay employee payroll withholding taxes in connection with stock based compensation transactions 

table of contents in our internal evaluations  we also use the non gaap financial measure operating free cash flow 
the difference between operating free cash flow and net cash provided by operating activities  which is the most comparable us gaap financial measure  is that operating free cash flow reflects the impact of capital expenditures 
since capital spending is essential to maintaining our operational capabilities  we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash 
as such  we believe investors should also consider capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities 
we view operating free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor in evaluating the amount of cash available for discretionary investments 
years ended june  cash flow provided by operating activities purchases of property  plant and equipment operating free cash flow our operating free cash flow was million for the year ended june   an increase of million from the year ended june  the improvement in our operating free cash flow resulted from the increase in our cash flow from operations 
we have maintained our capital spending at slightly lower than historical levels as a result of the recent economic uncertainties 
we expect that our capital spending for the next fiscal year will be approximately million 
we have million in aggregate principal amount of year senior notes due may  issued in a private placement 
the notes bear interest at  payable semi annually on november and may as of june  and  million of the senior notes was outstanding 
at june   we also had a credit agreement which provided us with a million revolving credit facility the credit facility and which was scheduled to expire in may on july   we entered into a new five year unsecured million credit agreement credit agreement led by bank of america merrill lynch  replacing the prior million revolving credit facility 
borrowings under the credit agreement on the closing date were used to repay all amounts outstanding under our prior credit facility  future borrowings may be used to provide working capital  finance capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions  refinance certain existing indebtedness and for other corporate purposes 
the credit agreement provides for an uncommitted million accordion feature  under which the facility may be increased to million  subject to certain conditions specified in the credit agreement 
loans under the credit agreement bear interest at a base rate greater of the applicable prime rate or federal funds rate plus an applicable margin or  at our option  the reserve adjusted libor rate plus an applicable margin 
as of june  and  there were million and million of borrowings outstanding  respectively  under the prior credit facility 
the credit agreement and the notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our current and future direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries 
we are required by the terms of the credit agreement and the senior notes to comply with financial and other customary affirmative and negative covenants for facilities and notes of this nature 
obligations for all debt instruments  capital and operating leases and other contractual obligations as of june  are as follows payments due by period total less than year years years thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations including interest as of june   we had non current unrecognized tax benefits of million for which we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows 
as a result  this amount has not been included in the table above 

table of contents we believe that our cash on hand of million at june   as well as projected cash flows from operations and availability under our credit agreement are sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the ordinary course of business  anticipated fiscal capital expenditures of approximately million  and the million of debt and lease obligations described in the table above  during the fiscal year 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies below have been identified as the critical accounting policies we use which require us to make estimates and assumptions and exercise judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods presented 
we believe in the quality and reasonableness of our critical accounting policies  however  it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using assumptions  estimates or making judgments different from those that we have applied 
our critical accounting policies are as follows  including our methodology for estimates made and assumptions used revenue recognition sales are recognized when the earnings process is complete  which occurs when products are shipped in accordance with terms of agreements  title and risk of loss transfer to customers  collection is probable and pricing is fixed or determinable 
sales are reported net of sales and promotion incentives  which include trade discounts and promotions and certain coupon costs 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in reported sales 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded in the period in which the related sale is recognized 
sales and promotion incentives we offer a variety of sales and promotion incentives to our customers and to consumers  such as price discounts  consumer coupons  volume rebates  cooperative marketing programs  slotting fees and in store displays 
the costs of these activities are generally recognized at the time the related revenue is recorded and are classified as a reduction of revenue 
the recognition of the costs of these programs involves judgments related to performance and redemption rates  which are made based on historical experience and other factors 
actual expenses may differ if redemption rates and performance varies from our estimates 
valuation of accounts and chargebacks receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations on existing and new customers daily 
we apply reserves for delinquent or uncollectible trade receivables based on a specific identification methodology and also apply a general reserve based on the experience we have with our trade receivables aging categories 
credit losses have been within our expectations in recent years 
while united natural foods  inc represented approximately and kehe distributors llc represented approximately of our trade receivable balance at june   we believe there is no significant or unusual credit exposure at this time 
based on cash collection history and other statistical analysis  we estimate the amount of unauthorized deductions that our customers have taken to be repaid and collectible in the near future in the form of a chargeback receivable 
while our estimate of this receivable balance could be different had we used different assumptions and made different judgments  historically our cash collections of this type of receivable have been within our expectations and no significant write offs have occurred during the most recent three fiscal years 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we would have the same experience with our receivables during different economic conditions  or with changes in business conditions  such as consolidation within the food industry and or a change in the way we market and sell our products 
inventory our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  utilizing the first in  first out method 
we provide write downs for finished goods expected to become non saleable due to age and specifically identify and provide for slow moving or obsolete raw ingredients and packaging 
property  plant and equipment our property  plant and equipment is carried at cost and depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful lives or lease life  whichever is shorter 
we believe the asset lives assigned to our property  plant and equipment are within the ranges guidelines generally used in food manufacturing and distribution businesses 
our manufacturing plants and distribution centers  and their related assets  are reviewed to determine if any impairment exists whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment testing requires estimates and judgments to be made by management with respect to items such as underlying cash flow projections  future sales volumes and growth rates 
at this time  we believe there are no impairments of the carrying values of such assets 
accounting for acquisitions part of our growth strategy has included the acquisition of numerous brands and businesses 
the purchase price of these acquisitions has been determined after due diligence of the acquired business  market research  strategic planning  and the forecasting of expected future results and synergies 
estimated future results and expected synergies are subject to judgment as we integrate each acquisition and attempt to leverage resources 
our acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  which requires that the assets and liabilities be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values 
this requires management to make significant estimates in determining the fair values  especially with respect to intangible assets  including estimates of expected cash flows  expected cost savings and the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
as a result of these significant judgments to be made we often obtain the assistance of independent valuation firms 
we complete these assessments as soon as practical after the closing dates 
any excess of the purchase price including  prior to fiscal  transaction costs over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in connection with some of our acquisitions  we have undertaken certain restructurings of the acquired businesses to realize efficiencies and potential cost savings 
our restructuring activities include the elimination of duplicate facilities  reductions in staffing levels  and other costs associated with exiting certain activities of the businesses we acquire 
prior to fiscal  the estimated cost of these restructuring activities were also included as costs of the acquisition and  as such  affected the ultimate recording of goodwill 
under the new accounting guidance adopted by us effective july   these costs must now be expensed 
it is typical for us to rationalize the product lines of businesses acquired within the first year or two after an acquisition 
these rationalizations often include elimination of portions of the product lines acquired  the reformulation of recipes and formulas used to produce the products  and the elimination of customers that do not meet our credit standards 
in certain instances  it is necessary to change co packers used to produce the products 
each of these activities soon after an acquisition may have the effect of reducing sales to a level lower than that of the business acquired and operated prior to our acquisition 
as a result  pro forma information regarding sales cannot and should not be construed as representative of our growth rates 
stock based compensation we provide compensation benefits in the form of stock options and restricted stock to employees and non employee directors under several stock based plans 
the cost of stock based compensation is recorded at fair value at the date of grant and expensed in the consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service period 
the fair value of 
table of contents stock option awards is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options using the straight line method 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various assumptions  including the expected volatility of our stock  the expected term of the option  the risk free interest rate and the expected dividend yield 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is equal to the market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant and is recognized in expense over the vesting period using the straight line method 
we recognize compensation expense for only that portion of stock based awards that are expected to vest 
we utilize historical employee termination behavior to determine our estimated forfeiture rates 
if the actual forfeitures differ from those estimated by management  adjustments to compensation expense will be made in future periods 
segments an operating segment is defined as that component of an enterprise i that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses  ii whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise s chief operating decision maker codm to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance  and iii for which discrete financial information is available 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
the company has determined that it operates in one segment  the sale of natural and organic products  including food  beverage  personal care and household products  and further that such single segment includes five reporting units in the annual test of goodwill for impairment 
characteristics of the company s operations which are relied on in making these determinations include the similarities apparent in the company s products in the natural and organic consumer markets  the commonality of the company s customers across brands  the company s unified marketing strategy  and the nature of the financial information used by the codm  described below  other than information on sales and direct product costs  by brand 
the company s five reporting units are grocery including snacks  tea  personal care  canada  and europe 
prior to its deconsolidation at the end of fiscal  hpp constituted a sixth reporting unit 
the company has further determined that its chairman of the board and chief executive officer is the company s codm  and is also the manager of the company s single segment 
in making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment  the company s codm focuses on sales performance by brand using internally generated sales data as well as externally developed market consumption data acquired from independent sources  and further reviews certain data regarding standard costs and standard gross margins by brand 
in making these decisions  the codm receives and reviews certain company consolidated quarterly and year to date information  however  the codm does not receive or review any discrete financial information by geographic location  business unit  subsidiary  division or brand 
the codm reviews and approves capital spending on a company consolidated basis rather than at any lower unit level 
the company s board of directors receives the same quarterly and year to date information as the company s codm 
goodwill and intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill  which is allocated to the company s reporting units  and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment at the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  and on an interim basis if indications of impairment exist 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair values of our reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired 
at this point we proceed to a step two analysis  wherein we measure the excess  if any  of the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value  and record the impairment loss indicated 
the estimate of the fair values of our reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment 
we generally use a blended analysis of the present value of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flow model uses the present values of estimated future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external economic factors in estimating our future cash flows 
the assumptions we use in our evaluations include projections of growth rates and profitability  our estimated working capital needs  as well as our weighted average cost of capital 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of a reporting unit based on a comparison to comparable publicly traded firms in 
table of contents similar businesses 
estimates used in the market value approach include the identification of similar companies with comparable business factors 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the assumptions we made could result in additional goodwill impairment in future periods 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of acquired trade names and trademarks 
we measure the fair value of these assets using the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that the trade names and trademarks have value to the extent their owner is relieved from paying royalties for the benefits received 
we estimate the future revenues for the associated brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
during the quarter ended june   we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and our trade names with the assistance of an independent valuation firm 
the analysis and assessment of these assets indicated that no impairment was required as the fair values exceeded the recorded carrying values 
the fair values of our personal care and canada reporting units exceeded their carrying values by less than 
these two reporting units represented approximately of our remaining goodwill balance as of april  holding all other assumptions constant at the testing date  a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used in the testing of these two units would reduce the estimated fair values below their carrying values  indicating a possible impairment 
while we believe these operations can support the value of goodwill reported  these reporting units are the most sensitive to changes in the underlying assumptions 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets deferred tax assets arise when we recognize expenses in our financial statements that will be allowed as income tax deductions in future periods 
deferred tax assets also include unused tax net operating losses and tax credits that we are allowed to carry forward to future years 
accounting rules permit us to carry deferred tax assets on the balance sheet at full value as long as it is more likely than not the deductions  losses  or credits will be used in the future 
a valuation allowance must be recorded against a deferred tax asset if this test cannot be met 
our determination of our valuation allowance is based upon a number of assumptions  judgments  and estimates  including forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and the relative proportions of revenue and income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
concluding that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence that is objective and verifiable  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
we believe that the cumulative losses incurred by the company in the united kingdom  represented sufficient evidence for management to determine that a full valuation allowance for our united kingdom deferred tax assets was appropriate  which the company initially recorded in the third quarter of fiscal until an appropriate level of profitability is attained  we expect to maintain a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets related to future united kingdom tax benefits 
if we generate taxable income in the future on a sustained basis in the united kingdom or other jurisdictions where we have recorded full valuation allowances  our conclusion regarding the need for full valuation allowances in these tax jurisdictions could change  resulting in the reversal of some or all of the valuation allowances 
if these operations generate taxable income prior to reaching profitability on a sustained basis  we would reverse a portion of the valuation allowance related to the corresponding realized tax benefit for that period  without changing our conclusions on the need for a full valuation allowance against the remaining net deferred tax assets

table of contents seasonality our tea brand primarily manufactures and markets hot tea products and  as a result  its quarterly results of operations reflect seasonal trends resulting from increased demand for its hot tea products in the cooler months of the year 
in addition  some of our other products eg  baking and cereal products and soups also show stronger sales in the cooler months while our snack food and certain of our prepared food product lines are stronger in the warmer months 
in years where there are warm winter seasons  our sales of cooler weather products  which typically increase in our second and third fiscal quarters  may be negatively impacted 
quarterly fluctuations in our sales volume and operating results are due to a number of factors relating to our business  including the timing of trade promotions  advertising and consumer promotions and other factors  such as seasonality  inclement weather and unanticipated increases in labor  commodity  energy  insurance or other operating costs 
the impact on sales volume and operating results due to the timing and extent of these factors can significantly impact our business 
for these reasons  you should not rely on our quarterly operating results as indications of future performance 
off balance sheet arrangements at june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k that have had or are likely to have a material current or future effect on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation inflation has caused increased ingredient  fuel  labor and benefits costs and in some cases has materially increased our operating expenses 
for more information regarding ingredient costs  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ingredient inputs price risk 
to the extent permitted by competition  we seek to recover increased costs through a combination of price increases  new product innovation and by implementing process efficiencies and cost reductions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on debt and cash equivalents  foreign exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses  and ingredient inputs 
interest rates we centrally manage our debt and cash equivalents  considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
our cash equivalents consist primarily of commercial paper and obligations of us government agencies 
as of june   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding 
assuming current cash equivalents and variable rate borrowings  a hypothetical change in average interest rates of one percentage point would not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows over the next fiscal year 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rates operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates  which are volatile at times  and the impact of such movements  if material  could cause adjustments to our financing and operating strategies 
during fiscal  approximately of our net sales were generated from sales outside the united states  while such sales outside the united states were of net sales in and of net sales in these revenues  along with related expenses and capital purchases are conducted in british pounds sterling  euros and canadian dollars 
we enter into forward contracts for the purpose of reducing the effect of exchange rate changes on forecasted intercompany purchases by our canadian subsidiary  which we have designated as cash flow hedges 
we had approximately million in notional amounts of forward contracts at june  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may also impact the stockholders equity of the company 
amounts invested in our non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at fiscal year end 
any resulting cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
the cumulative translation adjustments component of accumulated other comprehensive income decreased million during the fiscal year ended june  ingredient inputs price risk the company purchases ingredient inputs such as wheat  corn  soybeans  canola oil and fruit as well as packaging materials  to be used in its operations 
these inputs are subject to price fluctuations that may create price risk 
we do not attempt to hedge against fluctuations in the prices of the ingredients by using future  forward  option or other derivative instruments 
as a result  the majority of our future purchases of these items are subject to changes in price 
we may enter into fixed purchase commitments in an attempt to secure an adequate supply of specific ingredients 
these agreements are tied to specific market prices 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of our primary inputs as of june  based on our cost of goods sold during the twelve months ended june   such a change would have resulted in an increase or decrease to cost of sales of approximately million 
we attempt to offset the impact of input cost increases with a combination of cost savings initiatives and efficiencies and price increases to our customers
