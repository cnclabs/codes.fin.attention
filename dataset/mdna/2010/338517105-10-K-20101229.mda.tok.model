net income 
net income for our fiscal year increased  or to  from  for our fiscal year as a percentage of sales  net income for our fiscal year is  as compared to in our fiscal year new limited partnership restaurants during our fiscal years and  we did not have a new restaurant location in the development stage and did not recognize any pre opening costs 
while we currently have no new restaurants under development  if we are to open new restaurants  our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre opening costs  including but not limited to pre opening rent for the new locations 
we believe that our current cash on hand  together with our expected cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
trends during the next twelve months  we expect continued increases in aggregate food sales and bar sales and an increase in same store food sales and bar sales as compared to prior periods because of our new promotion  half price drinks from pm to closing  instituted during the first quarter of our fiscal year  direct mailing coupons and increases in 
table of contents liquor prices instituted during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year we expect package store sales to remain stable 
we expect higher food costs and higher overall expenses  which will adversely affect our net income 
in december   we raised menu prices to offset the higher food costs and overall expenses 
during the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  we raised certain of our alcoholic drink prices 
we plan to limit menu price increases as long as possible while maintaining our high quality of food and service and without reducing our food portions 
we have limited our advertising  but plan to attract and retain our customers by direct mailing coupons and offering promotional gift cards  but are monitoring the impact of such discounts on our g ross profit 
we may be required to raise menu prices wherever competitively possible 
although we have no new restaurant in development  we continue to search for new locations to open restaurants and thereby expand our business  but we are now looking for locations that will not require an extensive and costly renovation 
any new locations will likely be opened using our limited partnership ownership model 
we are not actively searching for locations for the operation of new package liquor stores  but if an appropriate location for a package liquor store becomes available  we will consider it 
liquidity and capital resources we fund our operations through our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations 
as of october   we had cash of approximately  an increase of  from our cash balance of  as of october  the increase in cash as of october  was primarily from our operations due to minimal demand upon our cash flow for extraordinary items

the cost of this refurbishment in our fiscal year was  for renovations to three existing company owned restaurants

in thousands current assets current liabilities working capital our working capital as of october  increased by from working capital as of october  our working capital increased during our fiscal year from our working capital for our fiscal year ended october  primarily due to the re classification of our line of credit as long term debt and notwithstanding our use of approximately  in connection with our acquisition of the real property and building where our combination restaurant and package liquor store located at n 
university drive  hollywood  florida store operates and our use of approximately  in connection with our acquisition of the real property and building where our restaurant located at west davie boulevard  fort lauderdale  florida store operates 
while there can be no assurance due to  among other things  unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues  or both  we believe that our cash on hand and positive cash flow from operations will adequately fund operations  debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year subsequent to the end of our fiscal year  we closed on the purchase of the real property and building where our

off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of the end of our fiscal year or our fiscal year critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements estimated useful lives of property and equipment the estimate of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates 
expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material 
in addition  periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material 
we estimate the useful life of those assets by considering  among other things  expected use  life of the lease on the building  and warranty period  if applicable 
the assets are then depreciated using a straight line method over those estimated lives 
these estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary 
any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary 
consolidation of limited partnerships as of october   we operate nine restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants 
additionally  we expect that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner 
in addition to the general partnership interest we also purchase limited partnership units ranging from to of the total units outstanding 
as a result of these controlling interests  we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of of the equity interests 
all intercompany 
table of contents transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the minority interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share 
income taxes fasb asc topic income taxes  requires  among other things  recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and to tax net operating loss and tip credit carryforwards to the extent that realization of said benefits is more likely than not 
for discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year on september   we adopted the provisions regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as required by these changes  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
we applied these changes to tax positions for our fiscal year ending october  we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to our financial po sition  results of operations or cash flows were required 
generally  federal  state and local authorities may examine the company s tax returns for three years from the date of filing and the current and prior three years remain subject to examination as of october  we do not expect that unrecognized tax benefits will increase within the next twelve months 
we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense 
other matters impact of inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  beverage and labor costs 
a large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results  but this circumstance may change in the future if food and fuel costs continue to rise
