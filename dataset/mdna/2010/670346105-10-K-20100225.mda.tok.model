item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations information required by this item is incorporated by reference to nucor s annual report  page forward looking statements and pages through item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  nucor is exposed to a variety of market risks 
we continually monitor these risks and develop appropriate strategies to manage them 
interest rate risk nucor manages interest rate risk by using a combination of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
at december   of nucor s long term debt was in industrial revenue bonds that have variable interest rates that are adjusted weekly or annually 
the remaining of nucor s debt is at fixed rates 
future changes in interest rates are not expected to significantly impact earnings 
nucor also makes use of interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   there were no such contracts outstanding 
nucor s investment practice is to invest in securities that are highly liquid with short maturities 
as a result  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a significant impact on the value of our investment securities 
commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business  nucor is exposed to market risk for price fluctuations of raw materials and energy  principally scrap steel  other ferrous and nonferrous metals  alloys and natural gas 
we attempt to negotiate the best prices for our raw materials and energy requirements and to obtain prices for our steel products that match market price movements in response to supply and demand 
nucor has a raw material surcharge designed to pass through the cost increases of scrap steel and other raw materials 
due to decreased demand for and cost of raw materials  however  the surcharge is impacting our sales prices to a lesser extent than in prior years 
through the first three quarters of  our earnings were negatively impacted from accelerated consumption of high cost iron units purchased prior to the abrupt downturn in economic activity late in since pig iron has purchase lead times of four to six months from ordering to delivery  dramatically and rapidly reduced sales volumes in the fourth quarter of and through much of resulted in the accumulation of increased tons of pig iron inventories  primarily at our steel mills  ordered at peak market prices 
as of the end of the third quarter of  we had completed the usage of those high cost iron units 
the impact on net

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued earnings of the high priced raw material inventory overhang was approximately million or per share after taxes 
as a result  we experienced significant improvement in our raw material costs during the fourth quarter of and expect to continue to see improved margins in nucor also uses derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to price risk related to natural gas purchases used in the production process and to hedge a portion of our aluminum and copper purchases and sales 
gains and losses from derivatives designated as hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized into earnings in the same period as the underlying physical transaction 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive income loss included million in unrealized net of tax losses for the fair value of these derivative instruments 
changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedges are recognized in earnings each period 
the following table presents the negative effect on pre tax income of a hypothetical change in the fair value of derivative instruments outstanding at december   due to an assumed and change in the market price of each of the indicated commodities in thousands commodity derivative change change natural gas aluminum copper any resulting changes in fair value would be recorded as adjustments to other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  or recognized in net earnings  as appropriate 
these hypothetical losses would be partially offset by the benefit of lower prices paid or higher prices received for the physical commodities 
foreign currency risk nucor is exposed to foreign currency risk through its operations in canada and trinidad and its joint ventures in australia and italy 
we periodically use derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuations 
open foreign currency derivative contracts at december  and were insignificant
