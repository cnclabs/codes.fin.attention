item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
narrative description of business founded in  jamba juice is a leading restaurant retailer of better for you food and beverage offerings  including great tasting fruit smoothies  juices  and teas  hot oatmeal made with organic steel cut oats  wraps  salads  sandwiches  and california flatbreads  and a variety of baked goods and snacks 
as of december   jamba juice had locations consisting of company owned and operated stores company stores and franchise stores franchise stores  making it one of the largest smoothie retailers in the united states by store count 
in fiscal  we experienced economic challenges which led to significant changes in our executive management team  including the hiring of james d 
white as chief executive officer and president in november in response to these challenges  in fiscal  we undertook various initiatives and strategic priorities to revitalize the company for future growth and long term stockholder value  which we call the blend plan 
the blend plan our strategic priorities the blend plan is the company s strategic plan to transform the jamba juice brand from a made to order smoothie company to a healthy  active lifestyle brand 
in fiscal  we achieved significant progress against the blend plan and we continue to evolve and develop the jamba juice and jamba brands and implement new business strategies that we believe will have a positive financial impact on the company 
the key strategic priorities for our blend plan in fiscal include building a customer first  operationally focused service culture  building a retail food capability across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon  and dinner  accelerating the development of franchise and non traditional stores  building a consumer products growth platform  and continuing to implement a disciplined expense reduction plan 
these strategic priorities support the company s mission to continue to grow and develop jamba as a premier healthy living brand offering consumers compelling and differentiated products and experiences at jamba juice stores and other retail distribution channels 
key to our success is the jamba culture  a unique set of core values and actions that manifest themselves in employees executing at the highest levels while expressing their passion for the brand 

table of contents building a customer first  operationally focused service culture a major aspect of our blend plan is to improve the level and consistency of customer service at our stores 
we implemented a series of procedural changes to simplify operations and improve customer service and we continued with our system wide mystery shop program 
consistent with our goal of building a customer first  operationally focused service culture  we continued to make progress training team members and validating results through our mystery shop program which has shown a substantial improvement in store performance scores over the last year 
we believe these changes resulted in a dramatic improvement in customer satisfaction during the year 
technology and procedural enhancements in areas such as labor management and scheduling implemented in relieved store managers from unnecessary administrative reporting and enabled them to focus on customer service 
we also hired a number of regional franchise consultants as company liaisons to our franchisees who can assist with rollouts of new products and marketing campaigns  provide best practices and provide franchisee feedback to the company 
we also implemented new performance standards and metrics to drive improvement and reinforce service expectations at the store level  and we refreshed stores to reinforce the vibrant and fun environment customers expect from jamba juice stores 
we plan to continue to leverage technology to better understand and improve upon customer service requirements measured by our mystery shop store performance tracking system and the deployment of a customer loyalty program 
we will focus on executing a best in class service experience for customers through implementation of enhanced training programs for team members and will continue to refine the in store customer experience by further refreshing the look and feel of existing jamba juice locations 
it is our intent that these programs will help to drive customer loyalty and satisfaction thus increasing frequency of visits and market share among jamba customers 
in an effort to serve as many customer needs as possible  we also engage in off site sales which we refer to as jamba catering that involve bringing jamba juice products to sell at an event such as a school  community or sporting events or for delivery to businesses or other organizations for meetings  parties and the like 
our commitment to health and wellness in schools is evidenced in part by our school lunch program 
with childhood obesity now a national concern  it is more important than ever for schools to provide nutritional and healthful food and beverage options to its students 
our program seeks to give schools the opportunity to provide these better for you beverage options during the school day 
another component of this effort is the addition of fundraising opportunities for non profit organizations 
we also work with individual organizations at the grass roots level and on a national basis  as we do in our relationship with the national pta 
building a retail food capability across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon and dinner menu overview we have traditionally provided a range of freshly blended beverages  baked goods and snacks in our stores 
our menu items are designed to strengthen the relationship with our customers by offering products that are relevant to individuals striving for a healthy  active lifestyle 
product innovation is a high priority and our research and development team  composed of food scientists  quality assurance specialists and food industry experts  is continually developing and testing new and improved menu items that support the integrity of the jamba brand and our commitment to offering great tasting products made from high quality ingredients 
in january  we began a broad rollout of steel cut hot oatmeal with fruit as another step in establishing our food program 
oatmeal was being offered in over locations nationwide by the end of fiscal in the summer of we introduced a variety of grab and go wraps  salads  sandwiches and our signature california flatbread food offerings which are now available in some combination in over system stores nationwide 
we intend to expand the reach of these offerings to be included in every jamba juice store across the country during fiscal 
table of contents in february we completed operational testing of our hot blends beverage platform in stores 
we believe hot blends beverages will bundle well with our oatmeal and other offerings  and could help offset seasonality and support sales results during the cooler parts of the year 
as of march   products in our hot beverage platform are currently available in more than stores system wide 
our current hot beverage offerings include four hot blends beverages prepared in a blender  including three tea latte flavors and a classic hot chocolate made with premium natural and organic ingredients  as well as six varieties of mighty leaf organic tea pouches 
these new products are designed to feature better for you  on the go food items to attract new customers  increase the frequency of current customer visits  create a point of differentiation  and help to provide a more complete meal solution for our customers across all day parts 
we believe this platform may also help offset some of the challenges the seasonal nature of our business has presented in the past 
as a result of our efforts to expand our food and beverage platform  we now have a more diverse menu offering which we believe will be more appealing to a broader group of consumers across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon and dinner and includes all or some combination of delicious smoothies  fresh squeezed juices  boosts  iced fruit tea infusions  hot blends tea and hot chocolate beverages  wraps  salads  sandwiches  slow cooked steel cut oatmeal with fruit topping and brown sugar crumble  california flatbreads  baked goods and a variety of packaged snacks and bottled beverages 
we plan to grow our food and hot beverage capability further during fiscal we believe there is consumer demand for better for you on the go food items that is not being fulfilled by other quick service restaurants 
our goal is for jamba juice to be the leader in the healthy quick service restaurant segment 
product innovation our research and development team continually seeks to enhance the product offerings available to customers  and where possible  reduce product and labor costs 
our research and development process includes both the development of new products and the optimization of existing menu items to ensure only the most appealing products are offered to customers 
as new products are introduced to the menu  usage occasions can increase and positive word of mouth can be spread 
we are passionate about creating fresh new products that meet an even greater variety of customer needs 
while there is no certainty that product development efforts will lead to the introduction and success of new product offerings or a potential increase in operating margins  we will continue to use these resources to try to develop fresh concepts that appeal to customers at any time of day and in any weather or season 
accelerating the development of franchise and non traditional stores jamba juice stores a primary goal of the company is to grow our brand by establishing more points of access to make it easier for customers to experience what we have to offer 
we believe we have significant market expansion opportunities both nationally and internationally 
our research and planning have shown that there is potential for at least  total jamba juice stores in the united states which we believe could be profitable and would meet our new store opening criteria 
we have grown our concept and brand through company store and franchise store locations 
as of december   there were jamba juice locations consisting of company stores and franchise stores operating in states and the bahamas 
except for the single bahamas franchise location we currently have no other international locations  however as discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we are exploring opportunities for international expansion 
of the locations  stores are located in california  of which are company stores and are franchise stores 
we lease the real estate for all of our company stores 

table of contents we generally characterize our stores as either traditional or non traditional locations 
traditional locations are characterized as a business premise that exists primarily as a jamba juice store 
traditional stores in the past averaged approximately  square feet in size 
these stores are located either in major urban centers or in suburban strip mall centers 
as of december   there were traditional jamba juice store locations 
non traditional locations are characterized as a jamba juice store located within another primary business in conjunction with other businesses or at institutional settings such as colleges and universities  shopping malls  supermarkets and airports 
a captive audience is a common characteristic of non traditional locations 
we believe one benefit of the development of non traditional stores is to increase awareness of the jamba juice brand to complement the traditional stores in the area 
as of december   there were non traditional jamba juice store locations 
we have lowered the typical costs to construct a traditional jamba juice store from an average of  in to an average of  today  depending upon location 
this cost reduction was accomplished through reducing our real estate footprint from an average of  sq 
ft 
to  sq 
ft 
for newer stores  aggressive competitive bidding with our general contractor pool to reduce leasehold improvement costs  aggressive competitive bidding for our furniture and fixtures package  value engineering  and innovative equipment and physical layouts to help reduce operational costs 
we believe reducing a traditional store s build out costs will help attract franchisees by providing a higher return on investment as franchisees are obligated to finance their own build out costs according to our specifications 
we have also developed flexible designs and formats which range in size from approximately sq 
ft 
to approximately sq 
ft 
for kiosks  and in line food court configurations with flexible product offerings for non traditional locations to maximize the opportunity and better respond to the need for stores with different configurations 
franchising growth strategy until the third quarter of fiscal  our growth strategy for traditional stores had been focused on the development of new company stores 
we have since shifted our focus and resources to place greater emphasis on the development of traditional and non traditional franchise stores 
we believe this franchise strategy will better position us for growth in market share  reduce capital outlays  provide better overall margins  allow us to open more stores at a faster pace  increase our brand presence to support other company initiatives such as licensing and consumer products  and increase customer frequency 
for fiscal  we opened two new company stores  and closed eight company stores 
franchisees opened new franchise stores  closed seven franchise stores and  as described in greater detail below  purchased company stores which are now operated as franchise stores in refranchising transactions 
during fiscal we opened our st university franchise store location and our eighth airport franchise store location and will continue to work with universities  airports and our franchise developers in an effort to open additional traditional and non traditional locations across the nation 
we anticipate minimal company store development in fiscal  with growth being primarily driven by the opening of non traditional franchise stores 
in fiscal  we also intend to expand the jamba brand presence in additional venue types including healthcare facilities and sports and entertainment venues 
following the end of fiscal  we also entered into an agreement with centerplate  inc  a major hospitality company which could potentially give us access to open additional franchise stores in as many as locations at a variety of managed sports and entertainment venues across the country 
we will also continue to explore opportunities with new multi unit developers and plan to open franchise stores in at least one international market 

table of contents in recognition of our expanding franchise program  in fiscal we established a franchise advisory counsel fac 
the fac formalizes a channel of communication through a representative group of franchisees to provide advice  counsel and input to us on important issues impacting the business 
franchising our franchising program through our franchising program  we offer franchisees choices in store format and number of stores they wish to operate including i traditional store venues such as single store franchises  ii nontraditional store venues such as mall  university or airport locations and iii exclusive multi unit license agreements in which the franchisee develops and operates a specified number of stores within a specified period of time within a specified geographic area  which we call area development agreements as described in franchising area development agreements below 
our current traditional store franchise agreement provides for a renewable year term 
the agreement is renewable for two consecutive year terms  subject to various conditions and state law 
the royalty rate in the current franchise agreement is generally of revenue  with franchisees required to contribute up to an additional of revenue to a company administered marketing fund 
at the present time  in general  we are charging of revenue as the marketing contribution for our traditional store franchisees 
franchisees are also expected to spend of sales on local marketing efforts 
there is typically up to a one mile geographic radius restriction for traditional stores in non downtown areas 
the royalty rates and marketing contributions for non traditional stores vary depending upon type airport  college or university or supermarket 
franchisees typically pay an initial fee ranging from  for non traditional store locations up to  for traditional store locations 
we generally do not provide any form of financing to our franchisees  but we may consider facilitating financing for potential franchisees in the future 
franchising area development agreements from time to time we enter into area development agreements or multi unit license agreements with franchisees who want to operate multiple store locations 
area developers typically enter into a separate franchise agreement for each store opened 
under typical multi unit license agreements  the area developer generally pays one half of a  initial fee  or  for each store required to be developed upon execution of the multi unit development agreement as a development fee 
area developers are obligated to finance their own build out of each store location according to our specifications and generally receive a one mile territory surrounding each store 
as of december   we had two multi unit area developers who have the right to develop additional franchise stores pursuant to multi unit license agreements  which they may choose not to exercise 
the exclusive territories covered by these multi unit area license agreements are i the hawaiian islands  and ii parts of texas  kansas and missouri 
both developers have satisfied their development obligations and the development rights of our developer in the texas  kansas and missouri areas will expire in april of we also often enter into development agreements in connection with refranchising transactions see below where a purchaser of company stores also agrees to develop new franchise stores 
as of december   we had one development agreement for three new franchise stores in the greater portland  oregon area as a result of a refranchising transaction 
as we continue our refranchising efforts  we expect that the buyers  in the aggregate  will undertake development obligations to open as many as additional new franchise stores 
we also continue to strengthen our relationships with food and beverage concessionaires operating at non traditional venues such as universities  airports  and other retail and entertainment venues to help maximize our non traditional franchise development 

table of contents franchising our refranchising initiative in may we announced our refranchising initiative under which we stated our intent to sell existing company stores to new or existing franchisees who want to operate multiple store locations 
we believe that our refranchising initiative will help accelerate growth and may also help us to achieve certain operational efficiencies 
in june  we obtained listing on the small business administration  or sba  registry in connection with this effort 
inclusion in the sba registry may help qualified potential buyers to receive expedited sba loans which could help facilitate the sale of additional company stores and the development of additional franchise stores 
under this refranchising initiative we plan to complete the refranchising of up to company stores to new or existing franchisees by the end of fiscal we also expect that many of the refranchising transactions will involve the buyers entering into area development agreements 
as we continue our refranchising efforts  we expect to realize a number of possible benefits including generation of additional cash  expansion of market share and accelerated growth of the brand outside of california  achievement of a more balanced risk and financial profile  improve long term stockholder value and earnings growth for the company  potential reductions in total general and administrative expenses  and acceleration of our growth as new area developers begin to fulfill their development obligations 
we sold company stores in three refranchising transactions during fiscal including the sale of eight stores to one of jamba juice company s original founders 
since the end of fiscal  we have completed the sale of additional stores in three separate refranchising transactions 
net proceeds generated by the sale of these stores were million 
we are optimistic about the progress we are making in this initiative  despite significant economic headwinds facing jamba juice and the buyers alike 
as we continue our refranchising efforts  we expect that the buyers  in the aggregate  will undertake development obligations to open as many as additional franchise stores 
franchising market planning and site selection process our market planning and site selection process is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy 
we have processes for identifying  analyzing  and assigning undeveloped markets for either company store or franchise store development 
once a market is selected  we carefully screen trade areas for demand based on demographic  psychographic and jamba juice specific variables to assess the risk of developing a store or permitting a franchisee to do so 
we review trade areas to ensure that they meet our guidelines for new store development and begin the site selection or approval process 
once a trade area is approved  we carefully screen prospective locations for visibility  traffic patterns  ease of use and co tenancy for potential company store and franchise store locations 
our expansion strategy involves using this market planning and site selection process to leverage areas of demand within each market 
we intend to use this approach to encourage the clustering of stores in specific geographic areas of demand  which we believe will drive brand awareness  improve operating and marketing efficiencies for franchise stores while leveraging the costs associated with regional supervision 
distribution efficiencies can also be realized through this strategy 
in addition  we believe the ability to hire qualified team members is enhanced in markets where we are well known 
building a consumer products growth platform we believe there is untapped potential to extend the jamba brand into the retail consumer packaged goods market 
in fiscal  we signed five separate license agreements covering the production of a jamba juice 
table of contents children s toy blender  frozen novelty bars  a line of apparel and bags  make at home smoothie kits and a variety of trail mixes 
in we hope to finalize a new concept to support the re launch of a jamba branded ready to drink beverage at retail store locations under our relationship with nestl 
we continue to have discussions with potential licensees regarding other product categories that we believe are a good fit with the jamba brand 
examples include fruit teas  fruit yogurt and parfaits  frozen smoothie bars and sorbets  breakfast and energy bars and packaged boosts 
our goal is to extend our product offerings outside of our jamba juice stores to not only generate revenue  but also to expand the brand accessibility and product usage occasions available to consumers 
to support and optimize this extension  we may structure these relationships in a variety of ways  such as licensing agreements  joint venture agreements  co packing agreements  and sales and distribution agreements 
we are pleased with the reception of these licensing opportunities we have seen so far from our existing licensees and we continue to work with other potential licensees to expand this platform 
we expect to announce additional licenses or other arrangements during fiscal continuing to implement a disciplined expense reduction plan this strategic priority involves all aspects of our system to improve store level profitability and returns for company store and franchise stores alike 
the plan is focused on a number of initiatives  including reductions in costs of goods sold  labor savings from operational simplification  improved wage and benefit management  the implementation and optimization of a labor planning system  rent and occupancy savings  improved management of controllable costs related to better cost controls and processes and the negotiation of service contracts and more effective and efficient brand communication 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to decrease as we implement the strategic initiatives described above  continue to improve our processes and systems and become more franchise focused 
store operations store management our field and store operations team is the foundation for our performance and is vital to the company s long term growth 
we recruit and retain leaders with broad experience in management and our industry 
we support our store operations with a combination of regional directors of operations  area district managers instituted in fiscal and district managers 
we also help support our franchise stores with franchise regional consultants who perform in similar capacities 
our typical store operations team consists of a combination of an area general manager instituted in fiscal or general manager at each store  two to four shift managers and approximately to front line team members depending on the time of year 
we are evaluating opportunities to further optimize our labor planning algorithms further to achieve optimal staffing levels throughout the day which may help us reduce staffing costs at certain stores under certain circumstances 
maintaining our culture  in company stores as well as franchise stores  is also essential as we continue to expand  and we believe that it is critical to developing our brand and ensuring our continued success 
we believe team members are the key to our success and that our culture fosters personal interaction  mutual respect  trust  empowerment  enthusiasm and commitment 
training we conduct various training programs for team members  support center staff and our leadership team 
we are dedicated to providing a meaningful experience for all team members  with ample opportunity to develop leadership skills as they move up through the organization 
our training programs include formal programs such as the manager in training programs for new managers and the more informal one on one discussions held 
table of contents between general managers  district managers and regional directors of operations 
in fiscal  we began building an online training program for shift managers that will be implemented in fiscal we updated our back of house systems to successfully be able to deliver this media in store 
all of our training programs have been updated to reinforce the importance of strong customer service and sales skills and we will use a station based training approach in the future which we believe will help optimize skill set development and resource utilization in our stores 
the goal of all the programs was to shorten the learning curve while creating greater confidence in order to achieve success through strong performance and results 
we also make training materials and best practice information available to our franchisees to help preserve a singular culture within all of the stores that comprise our system 
recruiting and retention we carefully screen potential team members to ensure that they hold many of our core values and fit into our culture 
by maintaining this emphasis and encouraging responsibility and accountability at every level  we believe that we have created a sense of team member loyalty and an open and interactive work environment  resulting in a highly passionate workforce 
our team members are paid competitive wages and are offered opportunities for advancement 
in addition to competitive wages  store managers are eligible for performance based bonuses 
we also provide best practice information  qualifications and other information to our franchisees to assist them with hiring and retention and to preserve a singular culture within the stores that comprise our system 
advertising and marketing our marketing strategy focuses on promoting jamba juice as a healthy  active lifestyle brand for consumers who prefer not to sacrifice taste or quality 
marketing efforts are primarily concentrated on creating local buzz that will generate positive word of mouth  an approach we call owning the two mile radius around our stores 
we also use social media outlets to encourage greater frequency of visits from existing customers and to drive trial and awareness among potential new customers 
consistent with the origins of our brand  we also engage local non profits and community organizations to drive brand awareness  trial and usage frequency among their members 
each store  whether a company store or franchise store  contributes of sales to a national marketing fund and is also expected to spend of sales on local marketing efforts 
in addition  the company is exploring the creation of regional advertising cooperatives to further develop regional advertising initiatives 
from time to time we engage in marketing campaigns to enhance national brand awareness 
we may in the future use print  radio  email  online and other advertising media in furtherance of this goal 
from time to time we also benefit from national media attention relating to some of our programs 
historically  we have not engaged in any mass media marketing programs  nevertheless  we have been featured in stories appearing in the wall street journal and a host of local newspapers and magazines 
we have also received product placement in television shows and feature films 
our participation in local fundraising events also helps capture a significant amount of coverage from local television stations 
product supply we are committed to providing only the finest smoothies  juices and other food products 
smoothie and juice products depend heavily upon supplies of fresh and individually quick frozen iqf fruit 
the quality of each smoothie depends to a large degree on the quality of the basic fruit ingredients from which it is made 
it is therefore essential that the supply of fruit is of the highest quality and is consistent throughout the year 
to achieve these dual goals we purchase our projected requirements for the coming year of a given type of fruit from suppliers at the height of the season for that particular fruit 
the supply and price of fresh and iqf fruit are dependent upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and are subject to significant volatility 
supply 
table of contents and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing regions  including weather  natural disasters and regional political and economic conditions 
in addition  as we continue to grow  we will likely become more dependent upon global fruit supplies than we have in the past  which could allow natural disasters and global political and economic conditions to have a greater effect on the supply and price of our fruit ingredients and our profitability 
southwest traders  inc is a distributor of proprietary products to our company stores and franchise stores 
southwest traders distributed ingredients that made up approximately of cost of goods for jamba juice company during fiscal southwest traders does not manufacture or negotiate pricing agreements for products sold in our stores 
they serve solely in a warehousing and distribution capacity 
in addition  the items in our grab and go food portfolio are supplied to us by a single supplier using regional co packers and distributed to our system stores by a multiple distributors 
competition the retail food and beverage industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
restaurants compete based on a number of factors  including quality  price value relationships  customer service  name recognition  employee hiring and retention and location 
we compete with a variety of purveyors of quick  convenient food and beverage products  including quick service restaurants fast food establishments  coffee shops  donut shops and grocery stores 
while competition in the food and beverage market is fragmented  competition is increasing  and a major competitor with substantially greater resources than the company could enter the market at any time and compete directly against jamba juice stores 
we compete most directly with regional smoothie stores  most of which are franchises of other smoothie brands 
the rising popularity of convenient and healthy food items may result in increased competition from non smoothie retailers as they increase their offerings of smoothies and other juice related products  and as we increase our food offerings we will be placing ourselves into direct competition with other quick serve food concepts with well established businesses 
in addition  we also face intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 
there can be no assurance that the company or our franchisees will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that the company or franchisees will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel to operate our stores 
government regulation and environmental matters government regulation 
we are subject to extensive and varied federal  state and local government regulation  including regulations relating to public health and safety and zoning codes 
we operate each of our stores in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations 
however  if we could not obtain or retain food or other licenses  it would adversely affect our operations 
although we have not experienced  and do not anticipate  any significant difficulties  delays or failures in obtaining required licenses  permits or approvals  any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of  or adversely impact the viability of  a particular store or group of stores 
california and other states and local jurisdictions have enacted laws  rules  regulations and ordinances which may apply to the operation of a company store  including those which a establish general standards  specifications and requirements for the construction  design and maintenance of the store premises  b regulate matters affecting the health  safety and welfare of our customers  such as general health and sanitation requirements for restaurants  employee practices concerning the storage  handling  cooking and preparation of food  special health  food service and licensing requirements  restrictions on smoking  exposure to tobacco 
table of contents smoke or other carcinogens or reproductive toxicants and saccharin  availability of and requirements for public accommodations  including restrooms  c set standards pertaining to employee health and safety  d set standards and requirements for fire safety and general emergency preparedness  e regulate the proper use  storage and disposal of waste  insecticides and other hazardous materials  f establish general requirements or restrictions on advertising containing false or misleading claims  or health and nutrient claims on menus or otherwise  such as low calorie  fat free or organic  g establish requirements concerning withholdings and employee reporting of taxes on tips and h regulate or ban the use of polystyrene cups 
in order to develop and construct more stores  we or our franchisees need to comply with applicable zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date  but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new stores 
we and our franchisees are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the us americans with disabilities act  which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability 
we may  in the future  have to modify stores  for example  by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures  to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons 
while these expenses could be material  our current expectation is that any such action will not require us to expend substantial funds 
we are subject to the us fair labor standards act  the us immigration reform and control act of and various federal and state laws governing various matters including minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions 
we pay a significant number of our hourly staff at rates consistent with but higher than the applicable federal or state minimum wage 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor cost 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations 
see risk factors governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we are also subject to various federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor licensee relationships 
many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement  including the duration and scope of non competition provisions  the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply 
the federal trade commission  or the ftc  and some state laws also require that the franchisor furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document that contains prescribed information and  in some instances  require the franchisor to register the franchise offering 
environmental matters 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the use of polystyrene products  and several counties in which our stores are located have already banned the use of our polystyrene cups 
as more state and local governments take actions to preserve the environment we may be subject to further bans on the use of polystyrene cups 
a federal ban on the use of polystyrene cups would force us to eliminate the use of polystyrene products system wide 
we are actively exploring economically viable alternatives to polystyrene cups  that can provide the same quality and integrity of our frozen smoothies to ensure customer satisfaction 
during fiscal  however  we launched our eco sustainability initiative focused on waste reduction  increasing the use of recyclable products and utilizing more organic ingredients 
we have also introduced green initiatives including the introduction of more environmentally friendly packaging for our products and the launch of several optimization programs to reduce waste 
among the packaging improvements made to date are the introduction of new cup carriers  oatmeal cups and lids  breakfast clear cups and lids  spoons and napkins that are made from recycled material 
we have also reduced the amount of corrugated cardboard used for bulk shipping  reduced labeling requirements  and reduced freight resulting in lower fuel emissions 

table of contents trademarks and domain names the company owns and or has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the united states and in other jurisdictions covering more than additional countries throughout the world 
some of the company s trademarks  including jamba juice and the jamba logo are of material importance to the company 
the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country 
however  trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and or their registrations are properly maintained 
in addition  the company has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names  including jamba 
com and jambajuice 
com 
management information systems each company store has computerized point of sale registers which collect transaction data used to generate pertinent information  including sales transactions and product mix 
additionally  the point of sale system is used to authorize  batch and transmit credit card data 
all product prices are programmed into the point of sale register from the company s corporate office 
franchise stores generally use the same point of sale registers as company stores  but may elect to use alternative systems provided certain information is provided to the company 
franchisees set their own menu prices 
company stores use the company s licensed labor scheduling and food cost management software to record employee time clock information  schedule labor  improve inventory management and provide management reports 
we believe the current point of sale register system is adequate to support our expansion needs 
seasonality our business is highly subject to day to day volatility based on weather and varies by season 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is realized during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year  which include the summer months 
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  which encompasses the winter months and the holiday season  has traditionally been our lowest revenue volume quarter 
although we have expanded the number of stores offering our hot oatmeal  grab and go food and california flatbread selections and we recently announced the launch of our hot blends beverage platform to help offset the seasonal nature of our business  our business will likely continue to be subject to seasonal patterns for the foreseeable future  given that the largest portion of our sales continues to be from the sale of smoothies during the warmer parts of the year 
because of the seasonality of the business  results for an individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be achieved for the full fiscal year

table of contents item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to our business we may not be successful in implementing our strategic priorities  which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
in fiscal we set out to implement the strategic priorities under our blend plan that we believed necessary to revitalize the company for future growth and long term stockholder value  including building a customer first operationally focused service culture  building a retail food capability across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon and dinner  accelerating the development of franchise and non traditional stores  building a consumer products growth platform  and continuing to implement a disciplined expense reduction plan 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic priorities or whether these strategic priorities will be successful  and a failure of either could impede our growth and operating results 
we have a history of net losses and may incur losses in the future 
we have incurred net losses in each of the last three fiscal years 
we may continue to incur net losses in the future and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
a worsening of economic conditions  a decrease in consumer spending  or a change in the competitive conditions in this market may substantially decrease our revenues and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
in  we continued to see many consumers facing steep mortgage payments  tightening credit and rising energy and food prices  which adversely affected consumer spending 
accordingly  we may experience continuing declines in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending  leading cost conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited  could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results of operations  business and financial condition 
our inability to compete with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins 
we compete with many well established companies  food service and otherwise  on the basis of taste  quality and price of product offered  customer service  atmosphere  location and overall guest experience 
our success depends  in part  upon the popularity of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day parts 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our products  our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day parts  or changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business 
we compete with other smoothie and juice bar retailers  specialty coffee retailers  yogurt and ice cream shops  bagel shops  fast food restaurants  delicatessens  caf s  take out food service companies  supermarkets and convenience stores 
our competitors change with each of the four day parts  ranging from coffee bars and bakery caf s to casual dining chains 

table of contents aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could reduce our revenue and operating margins 
we also compete with other employers in our markets for hourly workers and may become subject to higher labor costs as a result of such competition 
we are subject to risks associated with climate change and climate change regulation 
laws and regulations regarding climate change  energy usage and emissions controls may impact the company directly through higher cost of goods 
the potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time  and the company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on its consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations 
our revenue is subject to volatility based on weather and varies by season 
seasonal factors cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our revenue is typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people choose cold beverages and higher during the spring  summer and fall months for the opposite reason 
fluctuations in various food and supply costs  particularly fruit and dairy  could adversely affect our operating results 
supplies and prices of the various products that we use to prepare our offerings can be affected by a variety of factors  such as weather  seasonal fluctuations  demand  politics and economics in the producing countries 
these factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies  which could adversely affect our revenue and profits 
in addition  the prices of fruit and dairy  which are the main products in our offerings  can be highly volatile 
the fruit of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis  depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase 
an increase in pricing of any fruit that we use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability 
in addition  higher diesel and gasoline prices may affect our supply or transportation costs and may affect our revenue going forward 
although we attempt to help mitigate the risks of volatile commodity prices and allow greater predictability in pricing by entering into fixed price or to be fixed priced purchase commitments for a portion of our fruit and dairy requirements  we cannot assure you that these activities will be successful or that they will not result in our paying substantially more for our fruit supply than would have been required absent such activities 
declines in sales may also adversely affect our business to the extent we have long term purchase commitments in excess of our needs 
we are primarily dependent upon one supplier for a significant amount of our food distribution 
we maintain food distribution contracts primarily with one supplier 
this supplier  southwest traders  inc  provided approximately of our cost of goods for fiscal  and of cost of goods for each of our fiscal years and  which potentially subjects us to a concentration of business risk 
if this supplier had operational problems  our operations could be adversely affected 
we may face difficulties entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or new service providers 
if we expand our operations into new geographic areas through new company stores or franchise stores or introduce new products with special manufacture  storage or distribution requirements  we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers or enter into new arrangements with existing ones 
we may also encounter difficulties or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those we currently enjoy  which could harm our business and operating results 
our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or labor shortages 
labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business 
we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our team members 
a considerable number of the team members employed by us and our 
table of contents franchisees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
in  the federal minimum wage increased from to and it increased again in to 
additionally  many of our team members work in stores located in states where the minimum wage is greater than the federal minimum and receive compensation equal to the state s minimum wage 
during  we were affected by state minimum wage increases in illinois  oregon and washington  which were all above the federal minimum wage 
in addition  the city of san francisco has a minimum wage requirement greater than the state of california and the federal minimum which increased again during fiscal any further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases will increase labor costs 
if we are unable or unwilling to increase our menu prices or take other actions to offset increased operating costs  our operating results could suffer 
additionally  competition and labor shortages in various markets could result in higher required wage rates 
our ability to utilize our tax attributes may be limited by an ownership change 
our ability to use our tax attributes  such as our us federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards and our tax credit carryforwards  may be substantially restricted if we have had in the past  or have in the future  an ownership change as defined in section of the us internal revenue code 
an ownership change occurs if increases in the percentage of our stock held by percent shareholders within the meaning of section  with certain public groups treated as percent shareholders collectively exceed more than fifty percent  comparing the lowest percentage of stock owned by each percent shareholder at any time during the testing period which is generally a three year rolling period to the percentage of stock owned by the percent shareholder immediately after the close of any owner shift testing date 
our recent sale of series b preferred stock  or prior trading in our stock by stockholders  may have caused an ownership change 
it is possible that future trading in our stock may cause a future ownership change  resulting in an annual limitation on utilization of our tax attributes 
if our tax attribute usage is subject to limitation and if we are profitable  our future cash flows could be adversely affected due to our increased tax liability 
we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long term non cancelable leases 
we and our franchisees compete for real estate and our or their inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact our respective abilities to grow 
our leases generally have initial terms of between five and years  and generally can be extended only in five year increments if at all 
all of our leases require a fixed annual rent  although some require the payment of additional rent if store revenue exceeds a specified amount 
generally  our leases are net leases  which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance  taxes  maintenance and utilities 
we generally cannot cancel these leases 
if an existing or new store is not profitable  and we decide to close it  as we have done in the past and may do in the future  we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including  among other things  paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
current locations of our stores and franchised locations may become unattractive as demographic patterns change 
in addition  as each of our leases expire  we may fail to negotiate renewals  either on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could require us to close stores in desirable locations 
our business and results may be subject to disruption from work stoppages  terrorism or natural disasters 
our operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  acts of war  terrorism  pandemics  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
in particular  our corporate offices and support center is located in northern california  near known earthquake fault lines 
if a major earthquake or other natural disaster were to occur in northern california  our corporate offices and support center may be damaged or destroyed 
such a disruption could result in the temporary or permanent loss of critical data  suspension of operations  delays in shipments of product  and disruption of business in both the affected region and nationwide  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 

table of contents the unexpected loss of one or more members of our executive management team could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced significant changes in our executive management team since fiscal  including the departure of our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief marketing officer  senior vice president of operations  and senior vice president of development 
we have a relatively new chief executive officer  have internally promoted other members of the executive team  increased their responsibilities and hired additional management personnel from other companies in an effort to help revitalize our business during fiscal we believe that these individuals understand our operational strategies and new strategic priorities to revitalize our long term growth and stockholder value 
we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers  but we cannot make any assurances that we can retain these individuals for the period necessary for us to achieve and sustain profitability 
competition for personnel in our industry is strong and the ability to retain key employees during a revitalization effort can be difficult 
the unexpected future loss of services of one or more members of our executive management team could have a disruptive and adverse effect on our business 
if we are unable to retain key executive officers  then it may be difficult for us to maintain a competitive position within our industry or implement our strategic priorities 
our growth strategy depends on increasing franchise ownership 
there were company stores and franchise stores open as of december  our current growth strategy is to transition from a company store model to one of growth fueled by franchise store development 
this strategy is subject to risks and uncertainties 
we may not be able to identify franchisee candidates with appropriate experience and financial resources or to negotiate mutually acceptable agreements with them 
our franchisee candidates may not be able to obtain financing at acceptable rates and terms 
new and existing franchisees may need additional loans to fund ongoing operations or to meet other obligations under their franchise agreements 
given the current economy and a persistently tight credit market  such loans or other credit terms may not be available to our franchisees on acceptable terms or at all 
if prospective franchisees are not able to obtain the credit they need to start a business or if they and our existing franchisees are not able to obtain the credit they need to maintain ongoing operations  we may not be able to increase the percentage of franchised stores at the annual rate we desire or achieve the ownership mix of franchise stores to company stores that we desire within our planned timeframes or at all 
if we are unable to increase franchise ownership as planned our results of operations may be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the financial performance of stores concentrated in certain geographic areas 
our financial performance is highly dependent on stores located in california 
stores located in california comprise over of our total system stores 
in recent years california and other states have experienced significant economic impact due to the current economic climate 
if geographic regions in which we have a high concentration of stores continue to experience significant economic pressures  our sales and operating results could be negatively impacted 
expansion into new geographic markets may present increased risks 
franchise growth is planned in new geographic areas in the united states and at least one international market for fiscal our future results  and the results of new franchise stores  depend on various factors  including successful selection and expansion into these new geographic markets and market acceptance of the jamba juice experience 
those markets may have different competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than from existing markets 
as a result  those new stores may be less successful than stores in our existing markets 
consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the jamba juice brand  and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned 
franchisees may find it more difficult in new markets to hire  motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision  passion and culture 
stores opened in new 
table of contents markets may also have lower average store revenue than stores opened in existing markets  and may have higher construction  occupancy or operating costs than stores in existing markets 
furthermore  we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us  either initially or over time  with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards 
revenue at stores opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected revenue levels  and may never do so  thereby affecting our overall royalty income 
as with the experience of other retail food concepts that have tried to expand nationally and internationally  we may find that the jamba juice concept has limited or no appeal to customers in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of the jamba juice experience 
newly opened stores may not succeed  future markets and stores may not be successful and  even if we are successful  our average store revenue  and the royalty income generated therefrom  may not increase and may even decline 
we are also looking to expand our operations into international markets  which will expose us to new risks and uncertainties  including product supply  import export limitations and regulations to which we are not currently bound and may not be currently set up to handle  consumer preferences  occupancy costs  operating expenses and labor and infrastructure challenges 
if stores open in international markets and such stores are unable to source inventory locally  franchisees may be required to import inventory from our us distributors and any resulting import duties  tariffs  transportation or other charges may disproportionately impact such stores cost of goods which could harm the viability of such stores 
finally  international operations have inherent risks such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the application and effect of local laws and regulations and enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 
termination or non renewal of franchise agreements may disrupt store performance 
each franchise agreement is subject to termination by us in the event of default by the franchisee after the applicable cure periods 
upon the expiration of the initial term of a franchise agreement  the franchisee generally has an option to renew for an additional term 
there is no assurance that franchisees will meet the criteria for renewal or will desire or be able to renew their franchise agreements 
if not renewed  a franchise agreement and payments required thereunder will terminate 
we may be unable to find a new franchisee to replace such lost revenue 
furthermore  while we will be entitled to terminate franchise agreements following a default that is not cured within the applicable cure period  if any  the disruption to the performance of the stores could materially and adversely affect our business 
our franchising strategy means we will become more dependent on franchisees for our success 
several of our franchisees have been experiencing financial pressures  which  in certain instances  became more exacerbated during fiscal our franchisees closed seven stores in fiscal and may close additional stores in the future 
royalty revenues are directly correlated to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  franchise store closures have an adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding involving a franchisee could prevent us from collecting payments or exercising any of our other rights under the related franchise agreement 
our re franchising strategy may not be successful due to unfavorable economics  availability of credit for our buyers  the failure of royalty revenue to replace revenue available from company store sales or the failure of area developers to succeed in their obligations 
we are implementing a strategy to refranchise up to company stores in certain geographic markets by the end of fiscal given the current risks and financing challenges associated with becoming a franchisee of a restaurant retailer in the current economy  we cannot predict the likelihood of successfully refranchising any such markets or the amount of any proceeds that might be received therefrom  including the amounts that might be realized from the sale of store assets and from any related franchise agreements 
factors that affect whether a store or package of stores may be sold in a refranchising transaction include the availability of willing  qualified  suitable buyers for the company stores in question  whether the buyers will be willing to pay us what we believe is a fair price for such company stores and how quickly we are able to reach agreement on other terms of the 
table of contents refranchising transactions and consummate the sale 
buyers may need bank loans to finance all or a portion of their purchases and tight credit markets may make it more difficult for buyers to obtain these loans 
depending on the prices we ultimately receive in any given transaction  among other things  refranchising could result in the recognition of impairment losses on the related assets 
additionally  in certain instances  there may be change in control provisions in the lease which require us to get landlord consent for a refranchising transaction 
failure of a landlord to consent to the assumption of a lease from us by a franchisee  or to a sublease from us to a franchisee  could cause us to remain liable for such lease obligations or impair our ability to complete a transaction 
the conversion of a company store to a franchise store will reduce the total monthly revenue received by us from that store because we receive all of the revenue generated by a company store but receive only the royalty payments generated by franchise stores 
while we expect the conversion of company stores to franchise stores to reduce or eliminate the unreimbursed operating costs we incur in connection with the operation of such store  the actual benefit realized from refranchising the store is uncertain and may be less than anticipated  and may not be sufficient to offset the loss of revenue from the conversion of the company store 
upon completion of any refranchising transaction or our refranchising program as a whole  the success of each transaction and the refranchising program as a whole will depend upon  among other things  our buyers ultimate ability to effectively operate the stores they purchase  our ability to limit our exposure to contingent liabilities in connection with the sale of our stores and whether the resulting ownership mix of company stores and franchise stores will allow us to meet our financial objectives 
our existing management  infrastructure  financial  and other resources may be inadequate to support our franchise growth strategy 
in addition  refranchising activity could vary significantly from quarter to quarter and such volatility could impact our reported earnings 
although we expect some buyers in our refranchising transactions to enter into area development agreements to develop and open additional stores  there is no guarantee that this will be a part of each or any transaction and there can be no guarantee that the franchisees will succeed in their efforts to open additional stores 
our franchisees could take actions that harm our reputation and reduce our royalty revenue 
franchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees 
further  we do not exercise control over the day to day operations of our franchise stores 
any operational or development shortcomings of our franchise stores  including their failure to comply with applicable laws  are likely to be attributed to our system wide operations in the eyes of consumers and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on the royalty revenue we receive from those stores 
we could face liability from our franchisees and from government agencies 
a franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisor franchisee relationship 
various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we could be liable for damages to franchisees  fines or other penalties 
expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees 
governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we and our franchisees are subject to various federal  state and local regulations 
each of our stores is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health  sanitation  food and workplace safety and other agencies 
we and our franchisees may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new stores  which could delay planned store openings 
in addition  stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations 

table of contents our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the us americans with disabilities act  family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters 
in recent years  there has been an increased legislative  regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry 
establishments operating in the quick service and fast casual segments have been a particular focus  and compliance with additional regulations can become costly and affect our operating results 
government mandatory healthcare requirements could adversely affect our profits 
the company pays a substantial part of the healthcare benefits for team members at the general manager level and above and for those working at the company s corporate office 
other team members can purchase more limited healthcare benefits 
legislation is being proposed at the federal and state levels mandating employers to either provide health care coverage to their employees or pay into a fund that would provide coverage for them 
if this type of legislation is enacted in additional geographic areas where we do business  it could have an adverse effect on our profits 
self insurance plan claims could materially impact our results 
the company is self insured for team member healthcare and dental benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that the company retains are estimated in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities are based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as the company s actual historical trends 
if actual claims experience differs from the company s assumptions  historical trends  and estimates  changes in the company s insurance reserves could materially impact our results of operations 
our federal  state and local tax returns may  from time to time  be selected for audit by the taxing authorities  which may result in tax assessments  interest or penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we are subject to federal  state and local taxes in the us in making tax estimates and paying taxes  significant judgment is often required 
although we believe our tax positions and estimates are reasonable  if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company  we could have an additional tax liability  including interest and penalties 
if material  payment of such additional amounts could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
financing and liquidity risks insufficient cash flows from operations may adversely affect our financial condition 
in the past  cash flow from operations has at times been insufficient to cover capital expenditures 
these results have had a negative impact on our financial condition 
we believe the implementation of the strategic priorities under our blend plan will lead to our ability to eventually improve cash flows and to eventually achieve and sustain profitability 
our primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand that is largely attributable to our sale of series b convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock together  the series b preferred in mid  expected proceeds from refranchising transactions and expected availability of cash flows from operations 
if we are unable to maintain sufficient working capital  we may be forced to further reduce operating expenses  borrow funds  sell business assets or take other actions  which could be detrimental to our business operations 

table of contents risks relating to intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to build further brand recognition using our trademarks  service marks  trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property  including our name and logos and the unique ambiance of our stores both domestically and overseas 
we have secured the ownership and rights to our marks in the united states and have filed or obtained registrations for restaurant services in most other significant foreign jurisdictions 
we undertake similar efforts to protect our brands in other relevant consumer product categories in relevant jurisdictions 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate  or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property  the value of our store brand and our consumer products brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we have not encountered claims from prior users of intellectual property relating to restaurant services in areas where we operate or intend to conduct material operations in the near future  there can be no assurances that we will not encounter such claims 
if so  this could harm our image  brands or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 
the company s success depends on the value of the jamba juice and jamba brands 
the jamba juice brand practice is to inspire and simplify healthy living 
we believe we must preserve and grow the value of the jamba juice brand in order to be successful in building our business and particularly in building a consumer products growth platform primarily under the jamba brand 
brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions and the jamba juice brand has been highly rated in several brand studies 
we intend to reinforce and extend these perceptions for the jamba brand to help support our licensing efforts 
our brand building initiatives involve increasing our product offerings  opening new franchise stores and entering into licensing arrangements to increase awareness of our brands and create and maintain brand loyalty 
if our brand building initiatives are unsuccessful  or if business incidents occur which erode consumer perceptions of our brand  then the value of our products may diminish and we may not be able to implement our business strategy 
risks related to the food service business litigation and publicity concerning food quality  health and other issues can result in liabilities  increased expenses  distraction of management and can also cause customers to avoid our products  which could adversely affect our results of operations  business and financial condition 
food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from food quality  allergens  illness  injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one retail location or a limited number of retail locations 
adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us  regardless of whether the allegations are true  by discouraging customers from buying our products 
our customers occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our stores  or that we have problems with food quality or operations 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  including personal injury claims  contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination and similar matters  and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future 
regardless of whether any claims against us are valid  or whether we are ultimately held liable  claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance 
a judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage  or for which we are not covered by insurance  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects  which in turn could adversely affect our results 

table of contents in addition  the food services industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell  and disclosure and advertising practices 
we may also be subject to this type of proceeding in the future and  even if not  publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fast casual segments of the industry may harm our reputation or prospects and adversely affect our results 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses could harm our customers  result in negative publicity and cause the temporary closure of some stores and  in some cases  could adversely affect the price and availability of fruits and vegetables  any of which could harm our brand reputation  result in a decline in revenue or an increase in costs 
we consider food safety a top priority and dedicate substantial resources toward ensuring that our customers enjoy high quality  safe and wholesome products 
however  we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food borne illnesses 
furthermore  our reliance on third party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food borne illness incidents such as e 
coli  hepatitis a  salmonella or listeria could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations 
instances of food borne illnesses  whether real or perceived  and whether at our stores or those of our competitors  could harm customers and otherwise result in negative publicity about us or the products we serve  which could adversely affect revenue 
if there is an incident involving our stores serving contaminated products  our customers may be harmed  our revenue may decrease and our brand name may be impaired 
if our customers become ill from food borne illnesses  we could be forced to temporarily close some stores 
in addition  we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making any such changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses and injuries caused by food contamination have in the past  and could in the future  adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences  particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers 
as a result  our costs may increase and our revenue may decline 
a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity  or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our stores  could materially harm our business 
bans on the use of polystyrene products can negatively impact our operating results 
we are subject to regulations regarding the use of polystyrene products  and several counties in which our stores are located have already banned the use of our polystyrene cups 
as more state and local governments take similar actions  we may be subject to further bans on the use of polystyrene cups 
a national ban on the use of polystyrene cups would force us to eliminate the use of polystyrene which could potentially increase our costs and create customer satisfaction issues that could ultimately affect our operating results 
risks related to ownership of common stock failure of the company s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
internal control over financial reporting includes i maintaining reasonably detailed records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  and ii providing reasonable assurance that we a record transactions as necessary to prepare the financial statements  b make receipts and expenditures in accordance with management authorizations  and c would timely prevent or detect any unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud 
any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report 
table of contents our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
a significant financial reporting failure could cause an immediate loss of investor confidence in us and a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
our anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill  which would make it difficult for someone to acquire the company without the approval of the board of directors 
also  the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include other anti takeover provisions such as limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend its charter documents  including stockholder supermajority voting requirements  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting absent the request of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock  and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals 
the company is also afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law which prevents it from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of its common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless board of directors or stockholder approval is obtained

the amount of this preferential liquidation payment per share of the series b preferred can be substantial 
because of the substantial liquidation preference to which the holders of shares of the series b preferred are entitled  the amount available to be distributed to the holders of shares of our common stock upon a liquidation of the company could be substantially limited or reduced to zero and may make it more difficult to raise capital or recruit and retain key personnel in the future

pursuant to the registration rights agreement entered into in connection with the sale of our series b preferred  the registration rights agreement  we are obligated to use our reasonable best efforts to keep the 
table of contents registration statement on form s  declared effective by the sec on august   effective until certain conditions regarding resale of the series b preferred have been satisfied 
if we fail to comply with this or certain other provisions under the registration rights agreement  then we may be required to pay liquidated damages equal to one twentieth of one percent of the aggregate purchase price paid by the series b purchasers for the securities held thereby that can be registered on the registration statement for each day the failure continues 
the total liquidated damages under this provision are capped at of the aggregate purchase price paid by the series b purchasers in the private placement 
any such payments could materially affect our ability to fund our operations

the holders of shares of the series b preferred are entitled to vote on all matters on which the holders of shares of our common stock are entitled to vote  voting together with the holders of shares of our common stock as a single class 
each share of series b preferred is entitled to that number of votes as is equal to the quotient determined by dividing i the original issue price of as adjusted for any stock dividends  combinations  splits  recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares by ii the then applicable conversion price initially per share 
accordingly  each share of series b preferred is currently entitled to votes 
the holders of the shares of series b preferred also received customary protective provisions under the series b certificate of designation and additional protections under the securities purchase agreement as discussed in the risk factors above 
as a result  the shares of series b preferred represent  in the aggregate  more than of the voting power of our equity securities and may therefore have considerable influence in determining the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election of directors and approval of mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
the holders of the series b preferred also have significant control over the composition of our board of directors 
our certificate of incorporation and the securities purchase agreement confer significant power upon the holders of the series b preferred in the election or nomination of members of our board 
currently  the holders of series b preferred have the right to elect two members of our board and the holders of the series b preferred have the right to elect one member of our board 
under certain circumstances  the holders of series b preferred may be entitled to elect additional directors 
upon conversion of the series b preferred into common stock  assuming certain ownership thresholds continue to be met  the holders of series b preferred will have contractual rights to nominate members to our board 
because the holders of shares of the series b preferred will have the right to designate these members to our board  they have considerable influence on the composition of our board and  therefore  the conduct of our business 
the series b preferred is redeemable at the option of the holders under certain circumstances 
on or after june   the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred may require us to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of series b preferred 
the redemption price per share of the series b preferred is equal to the greater of i the sum of a the liquidation preference per share of the series b preferred which initially is per share  subject to adjustment  plus all dividend arrearages  plus b an amount per share of the series b preferred equal to accrued but unpaid dividends not previously added to the liquidation preference from and including the immediately preceding dividend payment date up to  but excluding  the date proposed for such redemption  whether or not declared  in cash  or ii the amount of all cash and other property to be distributed in respect of our common stock the holder of a share of the series b preferred would have been entitled to had it converted such share without regard to any limits on conversion immediately prior to the date proposed for such redemption 
depending on our cash resources at the time that this redemption right is exercised  we may or may not be able to fund the redemption from our available cash resources 
if we were unable to fund the redemption from available cash resources we would need to find an alternative source of financing to do so 
there can be no assurances that we would be able to raise such funds on favorable terms or at all if they are required 

table of contents we have agreed to give the holders of shares of the series b preferred the right to participate in subsequent stock issuances 
we agreed that if we issue and sell any new equity securities after june   subject to certain exceptions  we will give the series b purchasers the right to purchase a portion of those new securities so as to permit each of them to maintain their proportional ownership in our stock as long as such purchaser beneficially owns at least of the shares such purchaser originally purchased on june  the existence of this right may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing from third parties that do not wish to have series b purchasers participating in their financing 
the series b preferred private placement could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
each share of series b preferred stock is convertible into that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient determined by dividing as adjusted for any stock dividends  combinations  splits  recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares by the then applicable conversion price 
the initial conversion price of the series b preferred is per share 
upon such conversion  the company must pay the dividend arrearage  if any  on each share of series b preferred  plus an amount per share of series b preferred equal to accrued but unpaid dividends not previously added to the liquidation preference from and including the immediately preceding dividend payment date up to  but excluding  the applicable date of conversion  whether or not declared 
the holder of a share of series b preferred may elect to convert that holder s share at any time 
in addition  after june   we have the right to force conversion of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred upon certain conditions being met 
sales in the public market of the shares of common stock acquired upon conversion of shares of the series b preferred or exercise of the advisor warrant  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise funds in additional stock financings

among the key financial metrics upon which management focuses is reviewing its performance based on the company s consolidated gaap results  including company store comparable sales 
management also uses certain supplemental  non gaap financial metrics in evaluating financial results  including company store store level ebitda and consolidated ebitda 
company store comparable sales represents the change in year over year sales for all company stores opened for at least full fiscal periods 
consolidated ebitda is equal to net loss plus franchise support reimbursement  less a interest income  b interest expense  c income taxes  d depreciation and amortization  e gain from mark to market of derivative liabilities  f store pre opening expenses  g trademark and goodwill impairment  h impairment of long lived assets  i store lease termination and closure cost  and j other operating  net 
our definition of store level ebitda is different from consolidated ebitda because we further adjust net income to exclude general and administrative expenses 
management uses consolidated ebitda and store level ebitda i as measurements of operating performance because they assist us in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from our company store operations  ii for planning purposes  including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget  and iii as measurements in assessing the performance of existing store operating income and comparative operating performance 
consolidated ebitda and store level ebitda are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to income loss from operations or net income loss as indicators of financial performance 
each non gaap financial measure used as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies 
for a reconciliation of net income loss to these non gaap financial measures  see the discussion and related table below 
consolidated ebitda and store level ebitda a do not represent net income or cash flows from operating activities as defined by gaap  b are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund our cash flow needs  and c should not be considered as alternatives to net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or our other financial information as determined under gaap
