item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in thousands  except per share data our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide the reader of the company s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company s management 
to that end  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including without limitation  those factors described under the caption risk factors in part  item a of this annual report on form k 
furthermore  the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
our fiscal year begins on april and ends on march references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  and references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  overview measurement specialties  inc is a global leader in the design  development and manufacture of sensors and sensor based systems for original equipment manufacturers and end users 
our products are based on a broad portfolio of proprietary technology and typically sold under the meas brand name 
we are a global business and we believe we have a relatively high degree of diversity when considering our geographic reach  our broad range products  number of end use markets and breadth of customer base 
the company is a multi national corporation with twelve primary manufacturing facilities strategically located in the united states  china  france  ireland  germany and switzerland  enabling the company to produce and market world wide a broad range of sensors that use advanced technologies to measure precise ranges of physical characteristics 
these sensors are used for automotive  medical  consumer  military aerospace  and industrial applications 
the company s sensor products include pressure sensors and transducers  linear rotary position sensors  piezoelectric polymer film sensors  custom microstructures  load cells  accelerometers  optical sensors  humidity  temperature and fluid property sensors 
the company s advanced technologies include piezo resistive silicon sensors  application specific integrated circuits  micro electromechanical systems  piezoelectric polymers  foil strain gauges  force balance systems  fluid capacitive devices  linear and rotational variable differential transformers  electromagnetic displacement sensors  hygroscopic capacitive sensors  ultrasonic sensors  optical sensors  negative thermal coefficient ceramic sensors  torque sensors and mechanical resonators 
we compete in growing global market segments driven by demand for products that are smarter  safer  more energy efficient  and environmentally friendly 
we deliver a strong value proposition to our customers through our willingness to customize sensor solutions  leveraging our innovative portfolio of core technologies and exploiting our low cost manufacturing model based on our year presence in china 
effective december   we completed the sale of our consumer business  including our cayman island subsidiary  measurement limited ml  to fervent group limited fgl 
fgl is a company controlled by the owners of river display limited  our long time partner and primary supplier of consumer products in shenzhen  china 
accordingly  the related financial statements for the consumer segment are reported as discontinued operations 
all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for each of the periods ended march   and  exclude the results of these discontinued operations except as otherwise noted 
executive summary while the company s results in and reflect the declines resulting from one of the worst global economic recession in decades  we believe they also demonstrate our ability to manage the company through challenging conditions 
the company remains focused on creating long term shareholder value through continued development of innovative technologies and strengthening our market position by expanding customer relationships 
to accomplish this goal  we continue to take measures we believe will result in higher sales performance in excess of the overall market and generation of positive earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we have implemented aggressive actions that not only proactively addressed the economic recession  but we also positioned the company for future growth in sales and profitability  all of which we ultimately expect to translate to enhanced shareholder value 
to that end  we currently have one of the strongest product development pipelines in the history of the company  which we expect to lay the foundation for future sales growth 
research and development will continue to play a key role in our efforts to maintain product innovations for new sales and to improve profitability 
the company continues to expand its position as a global leader our broad range of products and geographic diversity provide the company with a variety of opportunities to leverage technology  products  manufacturing base and our financial performance 
prior to the recession  the company delivered strong growth in sales and profitability  through organic growth as well as through acquisitions 
we anticipate returning to that strategy  as we have already started to see the recovery in our sales 
trends there are a number of trends that we expect to have material effects on the company in the future  including recovering global economic conditions with the resulting impact on our sales  profitability  and capital spending  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  changes in our debt levels and applicable interest rates  and shifts in our overall effective tax rate 
additionally  sales and results of operations could be impacted by additional acquisitions  though there is no specific timetable for any acquisitions 
as economic conditions continue to improve  the company expects modest overall sales growth during as compared to we believe sales for the next six to nine months will continue to trend positively  but our visibility with respect to future sales beyond nine months remains limited 
current market indicators are mixed  but there are signs of improvement 
it is unclear whether the recent increase in sales and bookings is a result of the end of the recession and an overall sustainable increase in global economies across most market verticals 
we believe the majority of the improvement in our sales is due to improved overall demand  as well as increased market penetration 
the mixed indicators could indicate that global demand will not quickly recover  which could adversely impact the company s sales and profitability 
in particular  the company s automotive and heavy truck  housing and industrial businesses are likely to be the most impacted with medical technologies less affected 
in future periods  we expect the sensor market will continue to perform well relative to the overall economy as a result of the increase in sensor content in various products across most end markets in the us  europe and asia 
as detailed in the graph below  during fiscal the company continued to post consecutive quarters with higher net sales and higher adjusted ebitda on a trailing quarter to quarter comparison 
the continued increases in sales are encouraging  which leads us to believe we may have seen the worst of the recession  however  sales have not returned to prerecession levels for an extended period of time 
we believe sales bottomed out during our fourth quarter of fiscal  and the continued increases in bookings and backlog are positive trends  which if sustained  should translate to continued improvements in future sales performance 
economic conditions continue to be challenging and there is uncertainty as to the strength of the economic recovery with  among other factors  the euro zone debt crisis  europe s sluggish recovery  high unemployment  tight credit markets and weaknesses in the housing and automotive markets 
adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is not in accordance with  or an alternative to  measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
the company believes certain financial measures which meet the definition of non gaap financial measures provide important supplemental information 
the company considers adjusted ebitda an important financial measure because it provides a financial measure of the quality of the company s earnings from a cash flow perspective prior to taking into account the effects of changes in working capital and purchases of property and equipment and debt service 
other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda differently than we do  which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure 
adjusted ebitda is used by management in addition to and in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with gaap 
additionally  we believe quarterly adjusted ebitda provides the current run rate for trending purposes rather than a trailing twelve month historical amount 
the following table details quarterly net sales and also provides a non gaap reconciliation of quarterly adjusted ebitda to the applicable gaap financial measures 
quarter ended net sales quarterly adjusted ebitda income loss from continuing operations interest foreign currency exchange loss gain depreciation and amortization income taxes share based compensation other adjusted ebitda income from continuing operations before interest  foreign currency exchange loss gain  depreciation and amortization  income taxes  share based compensation and other 
other represents legal fees incurred related to certain international traffic in arms regulations matters the primary factors that impact our costs of revenue include production and sales volumes  product sales mix  foreign currency exchange rates  especially with the chinese rmb  changes in the price of raw materials and the impact of various cost control measures 
we expect our gross margins during fiscal to range from approximately to  primarily reflecting the impact of a more stable product sales mix  improved volume of business and assuming stability in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
gross margins for certain quarters could be outside this expected range based upon a range of possible factors 
gross margins have trended down over the past several years  largely due to unfavorable product sales mix both in terms of organic growth and acquired sales and the impact of the increase in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
our gross margins decreased in fiscal as compared to the prior year mainly because of the decline in overall volume of organic business 
as with all manufacturers  our gross margins are sensitive to the overall volume of business ie  economies of scale in that certain costs are fixed and certain production costs are capitalized in inventory based on normal production volumes 
since our overall level of business declined in fiscal  especially during the first half  and with the working off of inventory associated with the china facility move and alignment of inventory balances with the lower sales rates  our gross margins and overall level of profits decreased accordingly 
we expect continued pressures on our gross margins given our expectation that global demand will not quickly recover  which will result in unfavorable overhead absorption 
since around august  the rmb has stabilized relative to the us dollar 
in the near term  this trend is expected to continue  but there are indications that the rmb may begin to appreciate again 
total selling  general and administrative expense total sg a as a percentage of net sales was higher in fiscal and as compared to prior years before the recession  mainly reflecting the increase in total sg a expenses due to sg a expenses related to acquisitions and the decrease in sales 
historically  we have been successful in leveraging our sg a expense  growing sg a expense more slowly than our sales growth  but the global economic recession adversely impacted our sg a leverage 
as a percent of sales  total sg a for was  as compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
we are expecting in a decrease in our sg a as a percentage of net sales mainly due to higher sales  which are expected to be partially offset by continued investment in r d for new programs that are not yet generating sales such as our new fluid property sensor and reinstatement of compensation previously reduced as part of our proactive cost cutting measures to address the global economic recession 
amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred financing costs increased over the past two of years mainly due to the acquisitions of intersema and visyx the acquisitions and the acquisitions 
amortization is disproportionately loaded more in the initial years of the acquisition  and therefore amortization expense is higher in the quarters immediately following a transaction  and declines in later years based on how various intangible assets are valued and amortized 
amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal  assuming no new acquisitions 
however  amortization of deferred financing costs is expected to increase with the costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the company s primary credit facility in may see long term debt section below for further details regarding the refinancing 
at march   the company had approximately in deferred financing costs all of which will be written off in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the new credit facility 
in addition to the margin exposure as a result of the depreciation of the us dollar relative to the rmb  the company also has foreign currency exchange exposures related to balance sheet accounts 
when foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  there is a resulting revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated and accounted for in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange fx losses or gains due to the revaluation of local subsidiary balance sheet accounts with realized and unrealized fx transactions increased sharply in recent years  because of  among other factors  volatility of foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  our swiss company  which uses the swiss franc as its functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies us dollar and euro 
as the swiss franc appreciates against the us dollar and or euro  the cash balances held in those denominations are devalued when stated in terms of swiss francs 
these fx transaction gains and losses are reflected in our foreign currency exchange gain or loss 
aside from cash  our foreign entities generally hold receivables in foreign currencies  as well as payables 
in fiscal  we recorded net fx gains of  and in  we posted net fx losses of  in realized and unrealized fx changes associated with the revaluation of foreign assets held by our foreign entities 
the company s operations outside of the us have expanded over the years from acquisitions 
we expect to see continued fx losses or gains associated with volatility of foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses and may continue to use foreign currency contracts to hedge these fx exposures 
the company does not hedge all of its fx exposures  but has accepted some exposure to exchange rate movements 
the company does not apply hedge accounting when derivative financial instruments are used to manage these fx exposures 
since the company does not apply hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of those derivative financial instruments are reported in earnings in the fx gains or losses caption 
we expect the value of the us dollar will continue to fluctuate relative to the rmb  euro  swiss franc and japanese yen 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amounts of sales  profits  and assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
our overall effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate as a result of the allocation of earnings among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and their varying tax rates 
this is particularly challenging due to the different timing and rates of economic recovery as economies around the world try to recover from the recession 
we expect an increase in our overall effective tax rate as compared to last year  excluding discrete items 
the increase in the estimated overall effective tax rate mainly reflects the shift of taxable earnings to tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates 
additionally  last year s effective tax rate was impacted by a number of discrete items and the overall shift in profits and losses with a higher proportion of profits to those jurisdictions with lower tax rates and a higher proportion of losses to jurisdictions with higher tax rates 
the overall estimated effective tax rate is based on expectations and other estimates and involves complex domestic and foreign tax issues  which the company monitors closely  but are subject to change 
in fiscal  the company s subsidiary in china  meas china  received approval from the chinese authorities for high new technology enterprise hnte status 
hnte status decreased the tax rate for meas china from to through december  to qualify for this reduced rate the company must continue to meet various criteria in regard to its operations related to sales  research and development activity  and intellectual property rights 
the amount of income taxes we pay is also subject to ongoing audits by us federal  state and local tax authorities and by foreign tax authorities 
the company is currently being audited by the us internal revenue service for fiscal years ending and if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves  our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and deferred tax assets 
the company expects to continue investing in various capital projects in fiscal  and capital spending in is expected to approximate  this level of capital spending is higher than in fiscal  reflecting improved economic conditions and investments in new programs to generate new sales 
changes in our business acquisitions and divestures the company made two acquisitions during fiscal acquisitions 
atexis expanded our temperature sensors and probes utilizing ntc  platinum pt and thermo couples technologies and increased our temperature manufacturing base through wholly owned subsidiaries in france and china 
fgp was a competitor of custom force  pressure and vibration sensors for aerospace and test and measurement markets 
effective december   we completed the sale of the consumer segment to fervent group limited fgl  including its cayman island subsidiary  ml cayman 
fgl is a company controlled by the owners of river display limited rdl  our long time partner and primary supplier of consumer products in shenzhen  china 
accordingly  the related financial statements for the consumer segment are reported as discontinued operations 
all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended march   and  and consolidated balance sheets as of march  and  exclude the results of these discontinued operations except as otherwise noted 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards as part of the transition to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification as codification  plain english references to the corresponding accounting policies are provided  rather than specific numeric as codification references 
the as codification identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with us gaap 
the as codification was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after september  there was no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows upon the adoption of the as codification 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting principles for acquisition accounting and noncontrolling interests  which require most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value and require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity  which changes the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
these principles were effective april  the company will apply the new acquisition accounting principles to business combinations occurring after march  the accounting for contingent consideration under the new acquisition accounting principles requires the measurement of contingencies at the fair value on the acquisition date 
contingent consideration can be either a liability or equity based 
subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are recognized in earnings  not to goodwill  and equity classified contingent consideration amounts are not re measured 
the adoption of the new accounting principles for acquisition accounting and noncontrolling interests did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position  because the company did not have any acquisitions in new disclosure requirements for employer postretirement benefit plan assets were issued on december  and are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the new disclosure requirements for employer postretirement benefit plans clarify an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan 
the new requirements also prescribe expanded disclosures regarding investment allocation decisions  categories of plan assets  inputs  and valuation techniques used to measure fair value  the effect of level inputs on changes in plan assets and significant concentrations of risk 
the new postretirement plan disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued new accounting standards for leases  which removed fair value measurement requirements for certain leasing transactions 
in february  the fasb also delayed the effective date for fair value measurements for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years beginning after november the adoption of the fair value measurements requirements for non financial assets and liabilities did not have an impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in april  the fasb issued new guidelines for determining the useful life of intangible assets  which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of the new guidelines for determining the useful life of intangible assets is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
the new guidelines for determining the useful life of intangible assets shall be applied prospectively to all intangible assets acquired after march  the adoption of these guidelines did not have any impact on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting standards on accounting and reporting for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary 
the update is a scope clarification and revises the accounting requirements for decreases in ownership of a subsidiary that were originally contained in accounting for non controlling interests 
the revised decrease in ownership provisions require an entity that ceases to have a controlling interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a business to recognize a gain or loss on the transaction and include an amount for the remeasurement of any retained investment to fair value 
a decrease in ownership that does not result in a loss of control is accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the portion of the subsidiary or group of assets that is sold and consideration received from the buyer 
the update was effective for the company on april  the adoption of these new accounting standards did not have a material impact to the company  however  the requirements of this update will be required to be applied to any future transactions that results in a decrease in ownership of businesses owned by the company 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued new accounting standards for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
these new standards establish the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements  including multiple revenue generating activities  and provide amendments to the criteria for separating deliverables and measuring and allocating arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the amendments also establish a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable 
significantly enhanced disclosures are also required to provide information about a vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  including information about the nature and terms  significant deliverables  and its performance within arrangements 
the amendments also require providing information about the significant judgments made and changes to those judgments and about how the application of the relative selling price method affects the timing or amount of revenue recognition 
these new accounting standards requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after june   which is the company s fiscal year 
early adoption of the standard is permitted and various options for prospective or retroactive adoption are available 
the company is currently in the process of reviewing and evaluating the impact of these new requirements  but the impact is not expected to be material on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting principles for variable interest entities vies which  among other things  established a qualitative approach for the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie 
an enterprise is required to consolidate a vie if it has both the power to direct activities of the vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb the losses of the vie or the right to receive the benefits of the vie 
these principles improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with vies and address constituent concerns about the application of certain key provisions  including those in which the accounting and disclosures an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity  as well as address significant diversity in practice in the approaches and methodology used to calculate a vie s variability 
these new accounting principles related to vies are effective as of the beginning of the annual reporting period that begins after november   for interim periods within that annual reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
earlier application is prohibited 
the company currently consolidates its one vie  nikkiso therm n t  for which the company is considered the primary beneficiary 
the company is in the process of evaluating the new accounting principles for vies  and based on its preliminary assessment  the company expects the adoption of these new accounting standards may result in the deconsolidation of n t  which would decrease in the company s net sales for fiscal years  and by   and  respectively 
there would be no impact on net assets or net income attributable to meas with the deconsolidation of n t 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of sensors and sensor based systems 
in order for revenue and related cost of sales from product sales to be recognized there must persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s standard terms are fob shipping point  but a small portion of our customers have fob destination terms 
based on the above criteria  revenue is recognized depending on the specific terms of the arrangement either at the point of shipment for those sales under fob shipping point terms or when it is received by the customer for sales under fob destination terms 
for those transactions that are shipped at or near the end of the reporting period for which the sales terms are fob destination  the company confirms receipt of the shipment  and if delivery has not occurred  then the revenue is not recognized 
product sales are recorded net of trade discounts at the point of sale including volume and early payment incentives because these allowances reflect a reduction in the price for the products  sales returns  value added tax and similar taxes 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue  and shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in sales 
sales to customers generally include a right of return 
the company provides for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates 
sales returns have not historically been significant to our revenues and have been within the estimates made by management 
the amount of actual returns could differ from estimates 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
many of our products are designed and engineered to meet customer specifications  and customer arrangements do not involve post installation or post sale testing and acceptance 
there is no significant variation in sales terms geographically  or among product lines and industries 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the majority of the company s accounts receivable is due from manufacturers of electronic  automotive  military  medical and industrial products 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition and collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of allowances for doubtful accounts and other sales allowances 
accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
amounts collected on trade accounts receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
recent deterioration in overall global economic conditions and worldwide credit markets heightens the uncertainties related to customers ability to pay and may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the company would be required to reserve and write off additional accounts receivable balances  which would adversely impact the company s net earnings and financial condition 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed the company s estimates and changes to its estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm 
for purposes of analyzing the lcm  market is current replacement cost 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates historical cost under the first in  first out method 
market cannot exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicted costs of completion and disposal and market shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
in evaluating lcm  management also considers  if applicable  other factors as well  including known trends  market conditions  currency exchange rates and other such issues 
if the utility of goods is impaired by damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels or other causes  a loss shall be charged as cost of sales in the period which it occurs 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
generally  products that have existed in inventory for months with no usage and that have no current demand or no expected demand  will be considered obsolete and fully reserved 
obsolete inventory approved for disposal is written off against the reserve 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may be necessary for additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
the level of inventory reserves reflects the nature of the industry whereby technological and other changes  such as customer buying requirements  result in impairment of inventory 
cash flows from the purchase and sale of inventory are included in cash flows from operating activities 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at fiscal year end or more frequently under certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed and goodwill is not impaired 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  the fair value of the company s reporting units was determined using the discounted cash flow analysis in and the implied fair value approach in and the implied fair value approach consists of comparing the company s market capitalization to the company s book value 
if the market capitalization exceeds book value  there is no impairment of goodwill 
our evaluations were completed in the fiscal years ended march   and for asset values as of these respective dates 
based on our analyses and the guidelines established under related accounting standards  management has concluded there was no impairment of the company s goodwill in  and acquisitions acquisitions are recorded as of the purchase date  and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in all acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items are based upon management s best estimates using various valuation approaches  including the relief from royalty method  cost approach and income approach  depending on the circumstances 
certain of the acquired assets are intangible in nature  including customer relationships  patented and proprietary technology  covenants not to compete  trade names and order backlog  which are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets is recorded as goodwill 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
purchased intangibles and goodwill are usually not deductible for tax purposes in stock acquisitions 
however  purchase accounting requires the establishment of deferred tax liabilities on purchased intangible assets excluding goodwill to the extent the carrying value for financial reporting exceeds the tax basis 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with standards for accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and significant change in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using projected undiscounted cash flow at the lowest level at which cash flows is identifiable 
in the event impairment is indicated  fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method  appraisal or other accepted techniques 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
other factors could include  among other things  quoted market prices  or other valuation techniques considered appropriate based on the circumstances 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
impairment charges would be included in our consolidated statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of march   there were no overall indicators of impairment  however  the company performed an impairment analysis for two european sites resulting in no impairment 
at march   the company performed an impairment analysis for long lived assets  due to triggering events which included the decline in the company s stock price  change in market capitalization relative to net book value  and decrease in financial performance relative to historical operating results 
in evaluating long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets for impairment  there was no impairment identified by our analysis indicating the carrying amount of an asset was not recoverable in there were no indicators of potential impairment in foreign currency translation and transactions the functional currency of the company s foreign operating companies is the applicable local currency 
in consolidation  the foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss consists of net income for the period and the cumulative impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as receivables and payables 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in foreign currency exchange in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
however  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany notes of a long term investment nature which management does not intend to repay in the foreseeable future are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income  which is reviewed annually 
the company evaluates all positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required 
consideration of current and expected future taxable income of the company indicated that an overall valuation allowance is not needed 
the company annually evaluates positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is required 
as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k  the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately  at march  for certain deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards nols  principally at our german subsidiary 
this non cash charge to income tax expense reduced fiscal year net income by  or approximately per diluted share 
accounting guidance for such valuation allowances is strictly based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence which can be objectively verified as to whether it is more likely than not that the nols will be utilized 
if positive evidence does not outweigh negative evidence  the conclusion is that a valuation allowance is required 
at march   our german subsidiary had cumulative losses over the past three years  primarily due to a decrease in profitability as a result of the global recession 
the negative evidence of three years of cumulative losses was considered to outweigh the positive evidence that the net operating losses were not subject to expiration  because the long term prospects of future profitability were not considered objectively verifiable 
we expect our german subsidiary to return to profitability in a future period and we will continue to assess positive and negative evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is required in future periods 
transfer pricing refers to the prices that one member of a group of related companies charges to another member of the group for goods  services  or the use of intellectual property 
the company prepares various transfer pricing studies and other such procedures to assist in determining and supporting transfer pricing 
if two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries  the laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those charged by unrelated companies dealing with each other at arm s length 
if one or more of the countries in which our affiliated companies are located believes that transfer prices were manipulated by our affiliate companies in a way that distorts the true taxable income of the companies  the laws of countries where our affiliated companies are located could require us to re determine transfer prices and thereby reallocate the income of our affiliate companies in order to reflect these transfer prices 
any reallocation of income from one of our companies in a lower tax jurisdiction to an affiliated company in a higher tax jurisdiction would result in a higher overall tax liability to us 
moreover  if the country from which the income is being reallocated does not agree to the reallocation  the same income could be subject to taxation by both countries 
contingencies and litigation liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
share based payment the company has four active share based compensation plans  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k 
prior to fiscal  the company applied the intrinsic value method and related standards for accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants to employees 
the company began accounting for compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to april  based on the grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  in accordance with share based payment accounting provisions 
prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
in order to provide an appropriate expected volatility  one which marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option  the company revised  during the quarter ended september   the method of calculating expected volatility by disregarding a period of the company s historical volatility data not considered representative of expected future volatility and replacing the disregarded period of time with peer group data 
the company considers the period of time disregarded to be within the rare situations stated in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
the company experienced  during the period of time leading up to and after the restructuring in may  a rare series of events  including a going concern situation  financial statement restatement  a class action shareholder lawsuit  an sec investigation  a  asset write down  significant net losses  and a halt in the trading of the company s common stock  none of which are expected to recur in the future 
the company receives a tax deduction for certain stock options and stock option exercises during the period the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the fair value of the stock over the exercise price of the options at the exercise date 
the company is required to report excess tax benefits from the award of equity instruments as financing cash flows 
since the company is currently in a net operating loss carry forward position  the company applies the tax law ordering approach  whereby the tax benefits are considered realized for current year exercises of share based compensation awards 
these amounts are considered realized because such deductions offset taxable income on the company s tax return  thereby reducing the amount of income subject to tax 
the current year stock compensation deduction is used to offset taxable income before the nol carry forwards because all current year deductions take priority over nol carry forwards 
when the tax deduction exceeds the compensation expense  the tax benefit associated with any excess deduction is considered an excess tax benefit  or windfall 
the windfall portion of the share based compensation deduction reduces income tax payable and is credited to additional paid in capital apic 
the windfall credited to apic increases the company s apic pool available to offset future tax deficiencies shortfalls 
shortfalls are the amount the compensation expense exceeds the tax deduction 
results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march analysis of consolidated statement of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated statement of operations in comparing fiscal to fiscal for further details regarding certain trends and expectations  please refer to the executive summary and trend sections earlier in item  management discussion and analysis of our form k

organic sales  defined as net sales excluding sales attributed to acquisitions of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  declined  or 
the global recession in was one of the worst recessions in decades 
the overall impact of the recession was not evident in the first half of fiscal  but became more apparent in the third quarter of fiscal decreases in fiscal sales were in all sectors  driven largely by sharp reductions in sales to passenger and non passenger vehicle customers in us  europe and asia 
sales bottomed out in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and began to stabilize during the first quarter of fiscal on a trailing quarter to quarter basis  sales increased each quarter during fiscal  but overall  quarterly organic sales have not yet reached pre recession levels 
there is continued economic pressure in many areas of the global economy  and sales for most of our primary product lines declined relative to the prior year 
sales for our pressure products to automotive market and temperature sales were the two primary product lines to increase as compared to last year  mainly reflecting improvement in market conditions and broader production adoptions 
current market indicators remain mixed  which leads us to believe global demand will not quickly recover  and it is not yet clear whether the recovery is sustainable 
gross margin gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales declined to approximately from 
the decrease in margin is mainly due to lower organic sales and production volumes and the resulting decrease in leverage and overhead absorption  partially offset by certain cost control measures 
as with all manufacturers  our gross margins are sensitive to overall volume of business in that certain costs are fixed 
since our overall level of organic business declined relative to last year  our gross margins and overall level of profits decreased accordingly 
the decrease in production volumes not only reflects the decrease due to the alignment of production levels to match lower sales volumes  but also the consumption of inventory built up as part of the china facility move 
the average rmb us dollar exchange rate for remained stable as compared to last year 
on a continuing basis  our gross margin may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability of raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates  and other factors 
selling  general and administrative overall  total selling  general and administrative total sg a expenses decreased or to  largely due to cost reductions 
total sg a expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to from 
the decrease in sg a expenses as a percent of net sales is due to various cost control measures to reduce expenses while sales increased due to acquisitions 
organic sg a costs  defined as total sg a costs excluding sg a costs associated with the acquisitions of approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal  decreased approximately  to  partially offsetting the reductions in costs  the company accrued approximately  for bonuses for fiscal in direct response to the global economic recession  management implemented several cost control initiatives  including reductions in headcount 
additionally  organic sg a declined because of the decrease in organic sales  since a portion of our total sg a costs are variable and fluctuate with sales 
non cash equity based compensation non cash equity based compensation increased to  from  the increase in non cash equity based compensation is mainly due to the higher quantity of options granted and higher valuation of non cash equity based compensation 
the increase in the valuation of non cash equity based compensation is primarily the result of the increase in the company s stock price  higher volatility and quantity of options issued with the annual grants in relative to the annual grant in fiscal additionally  this fiscal year the annual stock option grant was in july  as compared to november last year 
total compensation cost related to share based payments not yet recognized totaled  at march   which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
amortization of acquired intangibles and deferred financing costs amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred financing costs increased to  from  the increase in amortization expense is due to higher amortization expense associated with the acquisitions and the write off of certain deferred financing costs 
amortization expense for intangible assets is higher during the first years after an acquisition because  among other things  the order back log is fully amortized during the initial year 
additionally  during the three months ended june   the company expensed approximately in deferred financing costs due to the amendment to the credit facility which resulted in a reduction in the principal amount of availability under the revolving credit facility 
amortization of acquired intangible assets is expected to decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal  assuming no acquisitions 
however  amortization of deferred financing costs is expected to increase with the costs incurred with refinancing of the company s primary credit facility and at march   the company had approximately in deferred financing costs that will be written off in the first quarter of fiscal as part of the new credit facility 
interest expense  net interest expense increased to  from  the increase in interest expense is primarily because prior year interest expense was lower since the company capitalized interest costs incurred on a portion of its debt during the construction of the china facility  and no such amounts were capitalized during the current year 
also contributing to the increase in interest expense was the increase in average interest rates 
average interest rates increased this year to about from last year 
average total outstanding debt was  in  as compared to an average amount outstanding of  in foreign currency exchange gain the increase in foreign currency exchange gain mainly reflects the increase in the gain associated with the changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro  and the decrease in foreign currency exchange losses associated with the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
over the past few years  the company has had foreign currency exchange losses due to the appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar  but during  the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar remained relatively stable as compared to  and as such  there was a significant decrease in the related foreign currency exchange loss 
the higher foreign currency exchange gain is the result of the depreciation of the value of the us dollar relative to the euro during the first part of fiscal the company continues to be impacted by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  including the impact of the fluctuation of the us dollar relative to the rmb  euro and swiss franc 
other expense income other expense income consists of various non operating items 
other expense income fluctuated to an expense of from income of mainly due to the income recognized for the of chinese incentives for foreign investments provided to the company last year  which was partially offset by other non operating expense items 
there were no chinese incentives in income taxes income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s assessment of future taxes expected to be paid on items reflected in the company s financial statements 
the company records the tax effect of discrete items and items that are reported net of their tax effects in the period in which they occur 
the company s effective tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  accruals related to contingent tax liabilities  the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns  the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws 
the company s effective tax rate for differs from the united states federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of lower effective tax rates on certain earnings from operations outside of the united states 
no provisions for united states income taxes have been made with respect to earnings that are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
the amount of united states income taxes that may be applicable to such earnings is not readily determinable given the various tax planning alternatives the company could employ should it decide to repatriate these earnings 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
the company is currently being audited by the us internal revenue service for fiscal years and if these audits result in assessments different from our reserves  our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities 
management performs a comprehensive review of its global tax positions on a quarterly basis and accrues amounts for contingent tax liabilities 
based on these reviews  the results of discussions and resolutions of matters with certain tax authorities and the closure of tax years subject to tax audit  reserves are adjusted as necessary 
income tax expense decreased  to from  last year 
the fluctuation of income tax expense is mainly due to the  of income tax expense recorded in to establish the valuation allowance principally for certain deferred tax assets associated with the company s german subsidiary  as well as due to the overall decrease in profit before taxes during the overall effective tax rate etr income tax expense divided by income from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately for the year ended march   as compared to for the year ended march  the decrease in the etr was due to  among other things  the income tax expense recorded in for the valuation allowance principally for certain deferred tax assets associated with the company s german subsidiary  changing economic conditions and the shifting of expected profits and losses before taxes between tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates  as well as the impact of a number of other discrete tax adjustments 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company received notification of approval from the local chinese tax authority for certain research and development r d deductions 
the income tax benefit of approximately associated with this r d deduction is reflected as a favorable discrete tax adjustment during the quarter ended september during the second quarter of fiscal  the company received approval from the swiss tax authority for a five year tax holiday effective in fiscal the company s tax rate in switzerland was reduced to approximately from 
in accordance with accounting principles for income taxes  the company revalued the company s swiss net deferred tax liabilities at the lower tax rate  resulting in a discrete non cash income tax credit of recorded during the quarter ended september during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s subsidiary in china received approval from the chinese tax authorities for high tech new enterprise htne status 
the new htne status for the company will provide a reduced tax rate of in china through december  to qualify for this reduced rate the company must continue to meet various criteria in regard to its operations related to sales  research and development activity  and intellectual property rights 
accordingly  the company recorded approximately non cash income tax expense related to the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in china resulting from the decrease in income tax rates 
the company generally considers undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the us and  accordingly  no us deferred taxes had been recorded with respect to such earnings 
however  the company elected to distribute  of undistributed earnings from its irish subsidiary  meas ireland  and recorded a deferred tax liability and corresponding discrete income tax expense of  during the quarter ended september  fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  in thousands  except percentages analysis of consolidated statement of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated statement of operations in comparing fiscal to fiscal years ended march  percent change change net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general  and administrative non cash equity based compensation amortization of acquired intangibles total selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net foreign currency exchange loss other income income before income taxes income tax expense due to tax law changes income tax expense due to valuation allowance income tax expense from continuing operations income tax expense from continuing operations income from continuing operations  net of income taxes less minority interest  net of income taxes income from continuing operations attributable to meas as part of our discussion and analysis  the following table summarizes certain items in our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales

the overall level of organic sales for fiscal was initially expected to be lower than the past few years  however  our expectation for lower organic sales was revised downward further during the year due primarily to the challenging global economic situation and uncertainty  as well as due to lower sales with the company s largest customer 
the recession was one of the worst recessions in decades  and there was downward economic pressure in most areas of the economy 
as such  sales for the year were down significantly  led by sharp reductions in sales to passenger and non passenger vehicle customers in us  europe and asia 
the most notable decline was with the automotive market 
while we believed sales were unusually hard hit as a result of customers reducing inventory levels to match lower anticipated demand for their products  it was not clear how much improvement we would see in future quarters or whether sales will continue to decline 
accordingly  we had taken decisive action  including aligning our labor workforce with the latest projected sale volumes 
we lowered costs through significant reductions in headcount  cut management salaries and eliminated the company s management bonus program and k match  and we had curtailed capital expenditures and implemented other cost control measures 
additionally  the company modified the three business group structure  in order to  among other things  better focus on cross selling of the differing sensor products and to address business conditions and certain changes within the management group  which resulted in one operating segment 
gross margin gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to approximately from 
the improvement in gross margin was due to several factors  including product sales mix and various cost control measures  partially offset by the strengthening of the chinese rmb  as well as the adverse impact on gross margins as a result of decrease in volumes 
the more favorable product sales mix was largely associated with decreased proportion of sales of lower gross margin products 
this included sales to the automotive sector  which carries a lower gross margin than our average 
additionally  our gross margins were adversely impacted by the lower levels of production and absorption of costs during the fourth quarter due to the consumption of inventory as part of the china facility move and to better align inventory levels with lower sales levels 
during the first half of fiscal  there had also been an adverse impact on margins due to increases in certain costs reflecting the pervasive impact on costs associated with higher prices for certain commodities 
the average chinese rmb exchange rate relative to the us dollar appreciated approximately as compared to last year 
this translated to approximately  in annualized margin erosion 
finally  as with all manufacturers  our gross margins are sensitive to the overall volume of business in that certain costs are fixed 
since our overall level of business declined in  our gross margins and overall level of profits decreased accordingly 
on a continuing basis  our gross margin may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability of raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates  and other factors 
selling  general and administrative overall  total selling  general and administrative expenses total sg a increased  or to  due to costs associated with the and acquisitions 
as a percent of net sales  total sg a expenses increased to from 
the increase in total sg a expenses as a percent of net sales was due to the decrease in net sales  which is the resulting impact of the global economic situation 
approximately  of the increase in total sg a was directly associated with the acquisitions and the first nine months of fiscal for acquisitions  and include higher salaries  amortization  facility expenses  professional fees  and acquisition related integration costs 
there was also an increase of in bad debt expense  reflecting the impact of the global economic recession 
partially offsetting the increases in total sg a discussed above are the impact of the various cost control measures implemented during fiscal  including reductions in headcount and management salaries  as well as the suspension of bonuses and k match 
stock option expense stock option expense decreased to  from  the decrease in stock option expense was mainly due to the lower valuation of non cash equity resulting primarily from the decrease in the company s stock price  partially offset by higher volatility and quantity of options issued with the annual grant in fiscal relative to the annual grant in fiscal total compensation cost related to share based payments not yet recognized totaled  at march   which was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangible assets increased  to  which was mainly due to higher amortization expense associated with the acquisitions 
amortization expense for intangible assets is higher during the first year after an acquisition because  among other things  the order back log is fully amortized during the initial year 
the increase in amortization expense associated with the two acquisitions consummated during the quarter ended march  was not as significant due to the close proximity of the transactions to our fiscal year end  but the impact on amortization expense related to these acquisitions was expected to be more significant next year 
interest expense  net interest expense decreased  to  for the year ended march  from  for the year ended march  the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to the decrease in average interest rates from last year to approximately this year  partially offset by an increase in the average total outstanding debt from an average amount outstanding of  in to  in interest expense was expected to increase during next fiscal year due to higher interest rates 
foreign currency exchange gain or loss the increase in foreign currency exchange loss mainly reflected the continued appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar  as well as the overall decrease in the us dollar relative to the euro as compared to last year 
the company continued to be impacted by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  especially with the continued impact of the appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar  even though the appreciation of the rmb was less in as compared to  as well as the impact of the fluctuation of the us dollar relative to the euro and swiss franc 
the company monitors such exposures and attempts to mitigate such exposures through various hedging strategies  but not all exposures are hedged 
other expense and income other expense and income consist of various non operating items  including sales of tooling and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
the increase from income of last year to income of mainly reflects approximately of chinese incentives for foreign investments provided to the company  partially offset by miscellaneous expense items 
income taxes total income tax expense during fiscal decreased  to  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease in income tax expense was principally due to lower taxable income in  lower proportion of taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions  and favorable r d tax credits in france  which were offset by a  income tax expense for the valuation allowances recorded at march  relating to deferred tax assets principally at our germany subsidiary 
the company s income tax rate income tax expense from continuing operations increased to approximately from approximately the prior year 
the increase in the income tax rate was mainly due to the valuation allowance recorded relating to the german subsidiary 
this was partly offset by a higher proportion of income being generated in those tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates and additional r d tax benefits in france 
the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately  at march  principally for certain deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards nols at our german subsidiary 
this non cash charge to income tax expense reduced our net income by  or approximately per diluted share 
accounting guidance for such valuation allowances is strictly based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence which can be objectively verified as to whether or not the nols will be utilized  and if positive evidence does not outweigh negative evidence  a valuation allowance is required 
at march   our german subsidiary had cumulative losses over the past three years  primarily due to the decrease in profitability during the second half of fiscal as a result of the global recession 
in weighing the positive and negative evidence  the negative evidence of three years of cumulative losses was considered to outweigh the positive evidence that the net operating losses were not subject to expiration  because the long term prospects of future profitability in future periods was not considered objectively verifiable 
we will continue to assess positive and negative evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is required in future periods 
during the quarter ended september   the company recorded a discrete non cash tax adjustment of approximately for the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in germany resulting from a decrease in tax rates enacted in the company s combined tax rate in germany decreased from to  as a result of the german business tax reform  which became effective on august  the china tax authorities announced an increase in the income tax rate to on december   effective on january  also effective january  was a withholding tax on the distribution of earnings 
the company submitted an application for high tech status last year  and it was not granted 
the company intended to continue to pursue qualification as a high technology enterprise with the chinese authority  and if the company is able to be awarded such qualification  the effective income tax rate will be reduced to plus the withholding tax 
the current guidance on the china tax law  without award of high tech status  was a graduated statutory rate from in calendar to in calendar year the applicable statutory rate effective january  was and increased january  to during the quarter ended march   the company recorded the reversal of a foreign income tax payable  which resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of or almost per diluted share 
the income tax payable related to a foreign tax accrual from at least fiscal  which had been previously considered a liability  however  based on discovered documentation  it was determined that the company was not liable for the amounts previously accrued 
our overall effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate based on the allocation of earnings among various taxing jurisdictions with varying tax rates and with changes in tax rates 
we expect our overall effective tax rate to generally increase due to more of our total income being generated in europe and the us  which are subject to a higher effective tax rates than our average and the impact of the increase in the china income tax rate 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations primarily consist of the remaining activity associated with the note receivable received by the company in connection with the sale of the consumer segment 
for the year ended march  and  imputed interest income related to the promissory note receivable totaled and  respectively  which is included in interest expense  net from continuing operations 
the activity in reflects the final settlement and collection of the note receivable 
the uncollected portion of the note receivable was written off as an expense from discontinued operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations are reported separately in the statement of cash flows  and the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the future liquidity and capital resources of the company 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances totaled  at march   an increase of as compared to march   reflecting  among other factors  the company s ability to generate positive operating cash flows  which was offset by approximately  in payments to reduce debt and  of cash used for purchases of property and equipment 
the following schedule compares the primary categories of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended march  and years ended march  change net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations net cash provided by used in financing activities from continuing operations net cash provided by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations a key source of the company s liquidity is our ability to generate operating cash flows 
in spite of the global economic recession  the company was able to generate positive operating cash flows  as a result of implementing initiatives to improve operating cash flows through working capital management and various cost control measures 
cash flows from operating working capital changes in trade accounts receivables  inventory  and accounts payable increased to  for the current year from last year  with the single largest driver of current year operating cash flows from inventory consumption 
inventory balances decreased  as compared to last year because of the utilization of inventory built up for the planned china facility move  as well as the reduction of inventory due to the decrease in projected sales 
the change in accounts receivable was an increase during the current year reflecting the increase in sales during the fourth quarter  as compared to a decrease in accounts receivable last year due the overall decline in sales due to the recession 
the increase in accounts payable corresponds to higher sales during the fourth quarter and the increase in accrued expenses reflects  among other things  higher accrued compensation related to the year end bonus and accrued interest 
the fluctuation in the income taxes payable and income tax receivable reflects  among other things  the collection of certain research tax credits and the swing from income tax expense to income tax benefit in certain tax jurisdictions as a consequence of the change from a profit before taxes to a loss before taxes during the current year 
historically  funding for acquisitions constitutes one of the more significant  if not the most significant use of the company s cash 
net cash used in investing activities was  as compared to  last year 
the prior year investing activities were higher because of higher capital spending due to the construction of the new china facility and the acquisitions of fgp and atexis 
there were no acquisitions during  and the lower level of capital spending during the current year mainly reflects the non recurring nature of the china facility  as well as various cost control measures in direct response to the recession 
the company s most significant use of cash during was the repayment of debt 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  for the year ended march   as compared to  provided by financing activities last year 
the company s credit facilities are mainly utilized to fund acquisitions 
the increase in debt payments reflects the company s efforts to reduce debt levels 
there was a decrease in borrowings as compared to last year since there were no acquisitions in the effect of exchange rate changes on cash is the translation decrease or increase in cash due to the fluctuation of foreign currency exchange rates 
for example   is translated to  based on weighted average exchange rates during fiscal  but the same  is translated to  using weighted average exchange rates during fiscal the decrease in the current year impact of exchange rate changes relative to last year is primarily due to the relative stability of the us dollar relative to the euro and rmb when comparing exchange rates from one fiscal year end to the next 
the following schedule compares the primary categories of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended march  and years ended march  change net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations net cash provided by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations the underlying reason for the decrease in overall operating cash flows is the economic recession  which reduced profitability and cash flows from operating working capital trade accounts receivables  inventory  less accounts payable 
net income declined  and the fluctuation in cash flows provided by operating working capital went from a source of operating cash flows of  in to a source of operating cash flow of during in spite of implementing various strategies to improve our cash position and working capital management  the company was not able to offset the impact of the recession 
the company closely monitors trade receivables and collections 
inventory balances increased as compared to mainly because of the build up in inventory for the planned china facility move 
we expected to reduce inventory levels during the next quarters with the completion of the move to our new china facility and to better align inventory levels with current levels of sales 
other items impacting operating cash flows include the fluctuation of income tax payable from a  use of cash in to a  source of cash in  and the  increase in depreciation and amortization expense associated with the acquisitions and the acquisitions 
in  deferred taxes mainly reflect the discrete adjustment recorded due to the change in german income tax rates  and deferred taxes mainly represent the valuation allowance recorded for the deferred tax assets of our subsidiary in germany  both of which are non cash transactions 
the operating cash flows also included the  payment for the settlement of certain litigation 
net cash used in investing activities was  as compared to  in overall capital spending levels of  reflect the increase associated with the new china facility  as well as various capital projects for production equipment 
the investing activity included the acquisitions of intersema and visyx for  and the cash flows associated with the acquisitions of atexis and fgp in the current year combined were approximately  net cash provided by financing activities totaled  for the year ended march   a decrease of  as compared to the  provided by financing activities in borrowings under the credit facility are generally for acquisitions  and acquisitions had a larger purchase price as compared to acquisitions 
additionally  the offsetting payments for repayments of debt were lower this year as compared to last year because the company retained cash to fund operations in light of the economic downturn and since interest rates were relatively low 
proceeds from exercise of options were lower in because fewer options were exercised due to the decrease in the company s stock price

on april   the company entered into an amendment the amendment to the amended credit facility whereby the company proactively negotiated a reduction of our debt covenant requirements  as a result of the decline in our sales and profitability resulting from the impact of the global recession

all of the aforementioned financial covenants were subject to various adjustments  many of which were detailed in the amended credit agreement and subsequent amendments to the credit agreement previously filed with the securities exchange commission  as well as other adjustments approved by the lender 
these adjustments included such items as excluding capital expenditures associated with the new china facility from capital expenditures  and adjustments to adjusted covenant ebitda for certain items such as litigation settlement costs  severance costs and other items considered non recurring in nature 
as of march   the company utilized the libor based rate for the term loan and for  of the revolving credit facility under the amended credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility was approximately at march  as of march   the outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility  which is classified as long term debt  were  and the company had an additional  available under the revolving credit facility 
the company s borrowing capacity was limited by financial covenant ratios  including earnings ratios  and as such  our borrowing capacity was subject to change 
at march   the company could have borrowed an additional  china credit facility on november   the company s subsidiary in china meas china entered into a two year credit facility agreement the china credit facility with china merchants bank co 
ltd cmb 
the china credit facility permits meas china to borrow up to rmb million approximately million 
specific covenants include customary limitations  compliance with laws and regulations  use of proceeds for operational purposes  and timely payment of interest and principal 
meas china has pledged its shenzhen facility to cmb as collateral 
the interest rate will be based on the libor plus a libor spread  depending on the term of the loan when drawn 
the purpose of the china credit facility is primarily to provide additional flexibility in funding operations of meas china 
at march   there was  outstanding borrowings against the china credit facility classified as short term debt and meas china could borrow approximately  promissory notes in connection with the acquisition of intersema  the company issued swiss franc denominated unsecured promissory notes intersema notes totaling  swiss francs 
at march   the unpaid balance of the intersema notes totaled  of which  is classified as current 
the intersema notes are payable in four equal annual installments on january and bear an interest rate of per year 
acquisition earn outs and contingent payments in connection with the visyx acquisition  the company has a contingent payment obligation of approximately  based on the commercialization of certain sensors  and a sales performance based earn out totaling  in connection with the atexis acquisition  the selling shareholders have the potential to receive up to an additional  tied to sales growth thresholds through calendar contingent earn out obligations for intersema and fgp acquisitions based on calendar sales objectives were not met 
no amounts related to the above acquisition earn outs were accrued at march   since the contingencies were not yet determinable or not yet achieved 
liquidity management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of available cash  our ability to generate cash and our ability to borrow to fund operating  investing and financing activities 
the company continues to generate cash from operating activities  and the company remains in a positive financial position with availability under existing credit facilities 
the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs  capital expenditures  earn outs related to acquisitions  and to pay interest and service debt 
we believe the company s financial position  generation of cash and the existing credit facility  in addition to the potential to refinance or obtain additional financing will be sufficient to meet funding of day to day and material short and long term commitments for the foreseeable future 
at march   we had approximately  of available cash and approximately  of borrowing capacity  after considering the limitations set on the company s total leverage under the revolving credit facility 
this cash balance includes cash of  in china  which is subject to certain restrictions on the transfer to another country because of currency control regulations 
the company s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the united states 
the company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
wherever possible  cash management is centralized and intra company financing is used to provide working capital to the company s operations 
cash balances held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  would potentially be subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted or prohibited by local laws 
where local restrictions prevent an efficient intra company transfer of funds  the company s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows  external borrowings  or both 
accumulated other comprehensive income accumulated other comprehensive income primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments  which relate to the company s european and asian operations and the effects of changes in the exchange rates of the us dollar relative to the euro  chinese rmb  hong kong dollar  japanese yen and swiss franc 
dividends we have not declared cash dividends on our common equity 
additionally  the payment of dividends is prohibited under our amended credit facility 
we intend to retain earnings to support our growth strategy and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
at present  there are no material restrictions on the ability of our hong kong and european subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends  loans  advances  or purchases of materials  products  or services 
chinese laws and regulations  including currency exchange controls  however  restrict distribution and repatriation of dividends by our china subsidiary 
seasonality as a whole  there is no material seasonality in our sales 
however  general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results  and certain end use markets experience certain seasonality 
for example  european sales are often lower in summer months and oem sales are often stronger immediately preceding and following the introduction of new products 
inflation we compete on the basis of product design  features  and value 
accordingly  our prices generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
increases in labor costs have not had a significant impact on our business because most of our employees are in china  where prevailing labor costs are low 
however  we have experienced increases in materials costs  especially during the end of fiscal and during the first part of fiscal  and as a result  we suffered a decline in margin during those periods 
during the second half of fiscal and all of fiscal  material costs stabilized as a result of the global economic recession 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
the company has acquired and divested of certain assets  including the acquisition of businesses and the sale of the consumer business 
in connection with these acquisitions and divestitures  the company often provides representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities  such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters  commercial disputes  environmental matters or tax matters 
the company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations  warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  the company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations  warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company s second restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made  or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director  officer or employee of the company  or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director  officer or employee of any other entity  subject to limited exceptions 
the company s amended and restated by laws provide for similar indemnification rights 
in addition  the company intends to execute with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement with the company which will provide for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which the company will agree to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding 
while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability  a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 
aggregate contractual obligations as of march   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows contractual obligations payment due by period total year years years years long term debt obligations interest obligation on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations total other long term obligations on the company s balance sheet under gaap primarily consist of obligations under warranty polices  foreign currency contracts and tax liabilities  but exclude earn out contingencies associated with acquisitions since the satisfaction of the contingencies is not determinable or achieved at march  the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management s estimate over the terms of these arrangements and are largely based on historical experience 
the above contractual obligation table excludes certain contractual obligations  such as earn outs related to acquisitions or possible severance payments to certain executives  since these contractual commitments are not accrued as liabilities at march  these contractual obligations are accrued as liabilities when the respective contingencies are determinable or achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity and credit risk  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company attempts to address its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities 
in addition  the company s broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 
interest rate risk under our term and revolving credit facilities  we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk 
interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan accrue at a rate based on either a libor rate plus a libor margin or at an indexed prime based rate plus an index margin 
the libor or index rate is at our election 
our results will be adversely affected by any increase in interest rates 
for example  based on the  of total debt outstanding under these facilities at march   an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and decrease our pre tax profitability by we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
commodity risk the company uses a wide range of commodities in our products  including steel  non ferrous metals and petroleum based products  as well as other commodities required for the manufacture of our sensor products 
changes in the pricing of commodities directly affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we attempt to pass increases in commodity costs to our customers  and we do not currently hedge such commodity price exposures 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments  foreign currency forward contracts and trade accounts receivable 
the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments 
the company places cash and temporary investments with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world 
although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations  it does periodically monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
in addition  concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company s customers 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and the company does not obtain collateral  insurance or other security 
notwithstanding these efforts  the current distress in the global economy may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from the company s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries  as well as from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
a appreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at march  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately  
although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes  it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a large portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies 
a substantial portion of our revenues are priced in us dollars  and most of our costs and expenses are priced in us dollars  with the remaining priced in chinese rmb  euros  swiss francs and japanese yen 
sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
as a result  the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced locally in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the us dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
refer to item  business  foreign operations for details concerning annual net sales invoiced from our facilities within the us and outside of the us and as a percentage of total net sales for the last three years  as well as net assets and the related functional currencies 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales  profit  and assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the rmb did not appreciate during fiscal  but appreciated by and during and  respectively 
the chinese government no longer pegs the rmb to the us dollar  but established a currency policy letting the rmb trade in a narrow band against a basket of currencies 
the company has more expenses in rmb than sales ie  short rmb position  and as such  when the us dollar weakens relative to the rmb  our operating profits decrease 
based on our net exposure of rmb to us dollars for the fiscal year ended march  and forecast information for fiscal  we estimate a negative operating income impact of approximately for every appreciation in rmb against the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and no associated cost increases or currency hedging 
we continue to consider various alternatives to hedge this exposure  and we are attempting to manage this exposure through  among other things  forward purchase contracts  pricing and monitoring balance sheet exposures for payables and receivables 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the us dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the value of the hong kong dollar will continue to be tied to that of the us dollar 
the company s french  irish and germany subsidiaries have more sales in euros than expenses in euros and the company s swiss subsidiary has more expenses in swiss francs than sales in swiss francs 
as such  if the us dollar weakens relative to the euro and swiss franc  our operating profits increase in france  ireland and germany but decline in switzerland 
based on the net exposures of euros and swiss francs to the us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate a positive operating income impact of approximately and a negative income impact of less than for every appreciation in the euro and swiss franc  respectively  relative to the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and associated cost increases or currency hedging 
the company has entered into a number of foreign currency exchange contracts in europe in an attempt to hedge the company s exposure to the euro 
the euro us dollar currency contracts have gross notional amounts totaling  with exercise dates through june at an average exchange rate of euro to us dollar conversion rate 
with these euro us dollar contracts  for every depreciation of the euro  the company would be exposed to an additional fx losses of approximately since these derivatives are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes  changes in their fair value are recorded in the results of operations  not in other comprehensive income 
to manage our exposure to potential foreign currency transaction and translation risks  we may purchase additional foreign currency exchange forward contracts  currency options  or other derivative instruments  provided such instruments may be obtained at suitable prices
