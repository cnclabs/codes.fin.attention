overview we are a leader in certain technologies involving the design and development of value added glass products  services and systems 
the company is comprised of two segments architectural products and services architectural and large scale optical lso 
our architectural segment companies design  engineer  fabricate  install  maintain and renovate the walls of glass  windows  storefront and entrances comprising the outside skin of commercial and institutional buildings 
businesses in this segment are viracon  inc  a fabricator of coated  high performance architectural glass for global markets  harmon  inc  one of the largest us full service building glass installation  maintenance and renovation companies  wausau window and wall systems  a manufacturer of custom aluminum window systems and curtainwall for the north american commercial construction market  linetec  a paint and anodizing finisher of architectural aluminum and pvc shutters for us markets  and tubelite  inc tubelite  a fabricator of aluminum storefront  entrance and curtainwall products for the us commercial construction industry 
our lso segment consists of tru vue  inc  a manufacturer of value added glass and acrylic for the custom picture framing and commercial optics markets 
the following are the key items that impacted fiscal the architectural segment s revenues were down consistent with our markets served  which have been impacted by tight us commercial real estate credit and depressed us employment levels 
operating results were down due to lower revenue  which resulted in low capacity utilization  declining pricing  and the decreasing mix of work bid during stronger commercial construction markets 
despite weak retail market conditions  our lso segment maintained revenues and operating income as new and ongoing value added product customers continued to convert to our best framing products during fiscal we have focused on making our business as competitive as possible in difficult market conditions by aggressively reducing costs by approximately million on an annualized basis over the last year and a half  and working continuously on productivity improvements 
our backlog decreased percent to million at february   compared to million at february  the architectural segment backlog  which represents more than percent of the backlog  decreased percent from the prior year as a result of the downturn in the commercial construction market and slow bid to award timing  despite strong bidding activity 
we generated million of cash flow from operations  which was  for the most part  retained in cash and short term investments to allow us to withstand the downturn and invest in growth initiatives 

table of contents strategy 
the following describes our business strategy for each of our segments 
architectural segment 
our architectural segment serves the commercial construction market  which is highly cyclical 
we have five companies within this segment that participate at various stages of the glass fabrication  window and wall supply chain each with nationally recognized brands and leading positions in their target market segments 
the glass and window and wall systems enclose commercial buildings such as offices  hospitals  educational facilities  government facilities  high end condominiums and retail centers 
we believe building contractors value our ability to deliver quality  customized window and curtainwall solutions to projects on time and on budget  helping to minimize costly job site labor overruns 
their customers building owners and developers value the distinctive look  energy efficient and hurricane and blast protection features of our glass systems 
these benefits can contribute to higher lease rates  lower operating costs due to the energy efficiency of our value added glass  a more comfortable environment for building occupants  and protection for buildings and occupants from hurricanes and blasts 
we look at several market indicators  such as office space vacancy rates  architectural billing statistics and other economic indicators  to gain insight into the commercial construction market 
one of our primary indicators is the us non residential construction market activity as documented by mcgraw hill construction fw dodge mcgraw hill  a leading independent provider of construction industry analysis  forecasts and trends 
we utilize the information for the building types that we typically supply office towers  hotels  retail centers  education facilities and dormitories  health care facilities  government buildings and high end condominiums and adjust this information which is based on construction starts to align with our fiscal year and the lag that is required to account for when our products and services typically are initiated in a construction project approximately eight months after project start 
from the mcgraw hill data  our markets had an annual compounded growth rate of negative eight percent over our past three fiscal years 
our segment s compounded annual growth rate over that same period was negative three percent 
our overall strategy in this segment is to defend and grow market share over a cycle by extending our presence while remaining focused on distinctive solutions for enclosing commercial buildings 
we draw upon our leading brands  energy efficient products and reputation for high quality and service in pursuit of our strategy 
each of our existing businesses has the ability to grow through geographic or product line expansion and we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities in adjacent segments 
finally  we aspire to lead our markets in the development of practical  energy efficient products for green buildings and the ability to deliver them in a sustainable manner 
over the last several years  we have added capacity to serve the us market for architectural glass fabrication and window and wall systems 
these investments included construction of a third location and expansion of two existing locations for our architectural glass fabrication business 
we also constructed a new window and wall manufacturing facility to leadership in energy and environmental design leed silver standards to replace antiquated facilities 
in addition  we acquired tubelite  a storefront and entrance fabricator  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  entering a significant segment of the commercial building enclosure market in which we had not previously had a presence 
our architectural businesses have introduced products and services designed to meet the growing demand for green building materials 
these products have included new energy efficient glass coatings  thermally enhanced aluminum framing systems and systems with high amounts of recycled content 
while the us commercial construction market is projected to continue to contract into fiscal  we are pursuing the same basic strategy with some adjustment for market conditions 
we have been and continue to take measures to keep our cost structure in line with revenue  including continuing to focus on productivity while maintaining capacity in order to gain market share when the market recovers 
we are aggressively pursuing international markets and the broader domestic markets for our architectural glass products 
we are bidding installation work in new metropolitan markets to offset declines in core markets 
we are focusing on renovation and new projects in the institutional sector  including government buildings  which should be more stable than private sector construction due to stimulus funding from the us government 
we are tightening our capital spending criteria  although we continue to have cash available for strategic investments for both international and domestic initiatives 
we expect to emerge from the current recession poised to win market share from competitors who were not as well positioned or do not have funds available to weather the current down cycle 
lso segment 
our basic strategy in this segment is to convert the custom picture framing market from clear uncoated glass to value added glass that protects art from uv damage while minimizing reflection from the glass so that viewers see the art rather than the glass 
we estimate that approximately percent of the retail picture framing market has converted to value added glass while the ultimate potential is significantly higher 
we offer a variety of products with varying levels of reflection control and promote the benefits to consumers with point of purchase displays and other promotional materials 
we also work to educate the fragmented custom picture framing market on the opportunity to improve the profitability of their framing business by offering value added glass 

table of contents in fiscal  we extended this strategy to the fine art market  which includes museums and private collections 
we also made capital investments to support the conversion to value added picture framing products as well as to grow the fine art market 
as part of that extension  we developed value added acrylic products in addition to glass 
acrylic is a preferred material in the fine art markets because the art can be much larger and weight is an important consideration 
in fiscal  we expanded our strategies to include other markets that can be served with anti reflective acrylic products 
results of operations net sales dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales fiscal compared to fiscal sales decreased percent primarily due to the decline in the commercial construction market 
the majority of the decline resulted from reduced volume in the architectural glass and installation businesses  but sales were also impacted by lower prices across all of the architectural segment businesses 
lack of available us commercial real estate credit and low us employment levels continue to negatively impact the commercial construction market 
fiscal compared to fiscal the percent increase in sales was primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of the storefront and entrance business late in fiscal and from volume increases resulting from the fiscal capacity expansions in our architectural glass business 
this business also benefited from price increases as a result of the improved commercial construction market experienced through most of fiscal these were offset by the impacts of cancellations and delays that occurred late in the third quarter and through the fourth quarter of fiscal  mostly impacting volume in our architectural glass business and window and wall business  and lower lso segment sales from reduced picture framing demand 
performance the relationship between various components of operations  as a percentage of net sales  is illustrated below for the past three fiscal years 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income  net results from equity method investee earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense earnings from continuing operations earnings from discontinued operations  net of income taxes net earnings effective income tax rate for continuing operations fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit improved by percentage points primarily due to improvements in margins in the installation and window businesses as a result of project mix and execution of work that was largely bid in stronger markets 
in addition  our picture framing business saw a positive mix of our best value added glass and acrylic products 
cost management and productivity improvements through out the company  partially offset by the impact of fixed costs on lower sales and lower pricing in the second half of the year for the architectural glass business  also contributed to the improvement in gross profit margin 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased as a percent of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  while spending decreased by million 
the decrease in spending primarily relates to lower sales and marketing expenses  reduced salaries and employee related expenses as a result of headcount reductions  and lower spending on consulting and other discretionary items as we focus on cost management 
these items were partially offset by a year over year increase in bonus and long term incentive expenses 
the prior year bonus and long term incentive compensation expenses were impacted by lower projected payouts of stock based incentives as a result of reducing our outlook for future years 
the increase as a percent of sales was largely due to our inability to leverage expenses over a lower level of sales dollars 
interest expense decreased million in fiscal due to reduced debt levels 
results from equity method investee in fiscal reflected the gain on sale of our percent interest in an automotive replacement glass distribution business  ppg auto glass  llc ppg ag 
during fiscal and in connection with ppg s sale of its automotive replacement glass businesses  we exercised our right to sell our minority interest in the ppg auto glass joint venture  resulting in cash proceeds of million and a pretax gain on sale of approximately million 
during fiscal  the joint venture reported a loss of million primarily due to soft conditions in the auto glass replacement market 
as a result of the sale  there was no impact from the joint venture in fiscal the effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reductions in reserves and deferred tax accounts in fiscal as a result of changes in estimates for previous tax positions taken 
fiscal earnings from discontinued operations were million compared to a loss of million in fiscal the current year earnings were due to the favorable resolution of an outstanding lease claim and a reduction in reserves related to the expiration of warranty periods 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated gross profit improved by percentage points primarily as a result of better execution by the installation and window businesses on projects with good margins  a good overall mix of projects and good pricing at our architectural glass business  slightly offset by operational challenges in the second and third quarters at our architectural glass business 
additionally  our picture framing business saw a strong mix of our best value added glass and acrylic products and improved productivity 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased as a percent of sales to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal  while spending increased by million 
the decrease as a percent of sales primarily relates to reduced long term executive compensation expenses  related to lower projected payouts of stock based incentives as a result of reducing our financial outlook for future years 
the remaining decrease as a percent of sales is due to leveraging expenses over a higher level of sales dollars 
the increase in spending was due to expenditures to update our computer systems and information technology infrastructure  as well as the impact of amortization of intangibles related to the storefront and entrance business acquisition 
interest expense decreased million from fiscal to fiscal this decrease includes a million decline due to lower weighted average interest rates on our revolving credit facility and a million increase in the amount of interest capitalized for capital expenditure projects 
equity in affiliated companies reflected our percent interest in an automotive replacement glass distribution business  ppg auto glass  llc ppg ag 
during fiscal and in connection with ppg s sale of its automotive replacement glass businesses  we exercised our right to sell our minority interest in the ppg auto glass joint venture  resulting in cash proceeds of million and a pretax gain on sale of approximately million 
excluding the gain on sale  equity in affiliated companies reported a loss of million for fiscal compared to million of income in fiscal this was due primarily to soft conditions in the auto glass replacement market during fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge related to the ppg auto glass joint venture  as well as a million write off of another equity method investment 
both charges are reflected in our consolidated results of operations as an impairment charge on investment in affiliated company 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a benefit recognized in the prior year upon conclusion of the analysis of research and development tax credits 
fiscal included both fiscal and additional prior years research and development tax credits  which lowered the rate 
fiscal was also impacted  to a lesser extent  by research and development tax credits taken  for fiscal only 

table of contents in fiscal  there was an immaterial net loss from discontinued operations of million compared to income of million in fiscal fiscal results included the gain on sale of certain assets related to our auto glass business of million  a reduction in reserves of million related to resolution of an outstanding legal matter in our discontinued european curtainwall operations  and net loss from operations of our auto glass business of million 
segment analysis architectural products and services architectural in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales decreased million or percent from fiscal  primarily due to declines in the commercial construction market 
our glass fabrication business was impacted most significantly as it has historically depended on the large project and office sectors  which slowed more significantly than the rest of the market sectors 
lack of available us commercial real estate credit and low us employment levels continue to negatively impact the commercial construction market 
fiscal operating income of million  or percent of sales  decreased million or percent from fiscal operating income of million  or percent of sales 
the decline in operating income was due to low capacity utilization in the segment  declining pricing and a declining mix of work that was bid in stronger markets 
these items were partially offset by productivity improvements and ongoing cost cutting measures at all businesses within the segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal net sales increased million or percent over fiscal  primarily due to the full year impact of the acquisition of tubelite late in fiscal the full year impact of the acquisition accounted for percentage points of the percent change 
additionally  volume increases from the fiscal capacity expansions  and price increases as a result of the improved commercial construction market experienced through most of fiscal in our architectural glass business increased revenues 
these were offset by the impacts of cancellations and delays that occurred late in the third quarter and through the fourth quarter of fiscal  mostly impacting volume in our architectural glass and window and wall businesses 
the architectural segment s operating income of million  or percent of sales  increased million or percent over fiscal operating income of million 
the primary driver of the year over year growth was solid execution of projects with good margins and a good overall mix of projects within our installation business 
the architectural glass business saw good pricing during fiscal  which was offset by mid year operational challenges in this business 
large scale optical technologies lso in thousands net sales operating income operating income as a percent of sales fiscal compared to fiscal lso revenues were down million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal lso segment operating income as a percent of sales improved to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal while operating income was relatively flat to the prior year 
we were able to maintain revenues and operating income despite weak custom picture framing market conditions as new and ongoing value added product customers converted to our best picture framing products 
the business also benefited from productivity improvements due to leveraging significant investments made in this business over the last two years 
these items were partially offset by the write off of certain production equipment held for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal lso revenues were down million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal revenues for this business were impacted by a declining custom picture framing industry that reduced square foot volume by percent 
fiscal also included million in sales from the pre framed art product line that was sold during the third quarter of fiscal these negative factors were partially offset by the incremental revenues earned from the shift in mix to our best value added products 
lso segment operating income as a percent of sales improved to percent in fiscal from percent in fiscal as our picture framing business experienced improved productivity and a stronger mix of our best value added picture framing glass and acrylic products in fiscal  and as we exited our unprofitable pre framed art product line 

table of contents consolidated backlog at february   our consolidated backlog was million  down percent from the million reported at february  bidding activity remains steady although average project values have declined  and bid to award timing continues to be slow as customers pursue every avenue for cost reduction 
the backlog of the architectural segment represented more than percent of consolidated backlog 
we expect percent of our total backlog to be recognized in fiscal revenue 
we view backlog as an important statistic in evaluating the level of sales activity and short term sales trends in our business 
however  as backlog is only one indicator  and is not an effective indicator of our ultimate profitability  we do not believe that backlog should be used as the sole indicator of future earnings of the company 
acquisitions on december   we acquired all of the shares of tubelite  inc  a privately held business  for million  including transaction costs of million and net of cash acquired of million 
tubelite s results of operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements and within the architectural segment since the date of acquisition 
tubelite fabricates aluminum storefront  entrance and curtainwall products for the us commercial construction industry 
the purchase is part of our strategy to grow our presence in commercial architectural markets 
goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was million and is not tax deductible 
identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were million and include customer relationships  trademarks and non compete agreements with a weighted average useful life of years 
discontinued operations during fiscal  we announced our intention to discontinue the manufacturing of automotive replacement glass products and also announced the decision to sell the remaining portion of the auto glass segment that manufactures and sells original equipment manufacturer and aftermarket replacement windshields for the recreational vehicle and bus markets 
we restated our consolidated financial statements to show the results of the auto glass segment in discontinued operations 
we completed the sale of certain assets related to the business during the third quarter of fiscal conclusion of the sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million which is included in earnings from discontinued operations in the consolidated results of operations for fiscal in several transactions in fiscal years through  we completed the sale of our large scale domestic curtainwall business  the sale of our detention security business and the exit from international curtainwall operations 
the remaining estimated cash expenditures related to these discontinued operations are recorded as liabilities of discontinued operations  and a majority of the remaining cash expenditures related to discontinued operations is expected to be paid within the next three years 
the majority of these liabilities relate to the international curtainwall operations  including bonds outstanding  of which the precise degree of liability related to these matters will not be known until they are settled within the uk courts 
the reserve for discontinued operations also covers other liability issues  consisting of warranty and other costs relating to these and other international construction projects 
during fiscal  a favorable resolution of an outstanding lease claim and a reduction in reserves related to the expiration of warranty periods resulted in pre tax income from discontinued operations of million 
for fiscal  we reported an immaterial net loss from discontinued operations of million 
in fiscal  our discontinued operations reserves were reduced by million  primarily due to resolution of an outstanding legal matter related to a significant french curtainwall project  resulting in non cash income from discontinued operations of million 
related party transactions in connection with ppg s sale of its automotive replacement glass businesses during fiscal  we exercised our right to sell our minority interest in the ppg auto glass joint venture 
as a result  ppg and ppg auto glass are no longer deemed to be related parties 
liquidity and capital resources cash effect  in thousands net cash provided by continuing operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from sale of investment in affiliated company acquisition of intangibles and businesses  net of cash acquired net purchases of short term investments and marketable securities repayment borrowing activities  net purchases and retirement of company common stock dividends paid 
table of contents operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by million for fiscal and increased by million for fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to lower current year earnings 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was driven by higher net earnings and cash generated by continued improvements in our working capital management processes 
we continue to focus on lowering our working capital requirements 
non cash working capital current assets  excluding cash and short term investments  less current liabilities was million at february  or percent of fiscal sales  our key metric for measuring working capital efficiency 
this compares to million at february  or percent of fiscal sales 
the improvement over fiscal is largely the result of initiatives to expedite billings and collections 
we believe this metric will be negatively impacted during fiscal by the downturn in the us commercial construction market as some customers  general contractors and building owners may experience increased liquidity issues 
investing activities 
investing activities used net cash of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal and were million in both fiscal and the fiscal expenditures have been focused on safety and maintenance projects  as well as quick pay back productivity improvements 
fiscal spending was primarily for productivity improvements and capacity expansions in both operating segments  including approximately million for a new leed silver architectural window facility 
fiscal capital expenditures included spending for building expansion and equipment for our picture framing business  to expand manufacturing capacity for our highest value added picture framing products  and for expansion of our architectural glass fabrication facilities  including finalization of the st 
george  utah facility and conversion of our auto glass manufacturing facility to support architectural glass fabrication 
during fiscal  the company exercised buy out options on two equipment sale and leaseback agreements for million and included these in capital expenditures 
in fiscal  we received million of proceeds on the sale of our interest in the ppg auto glass joint venture 
fiscal investing activities included the acquisition of tubelite on december  we acquired all of the shares of tubelite  a privately held business  for million  including transaction costs of million and net of cash acquired of million 
the net position of our investments for fiscal resulted in million in net purchases versus million in fiscal and million in fiscal these investments were made with cash generated by operations  we invested in liquid securities to be used during the market downturn and for strategic investment 
we anticipate that our fiscal maintenance and safety related capital expenditures will be less than million 
we continue to review our portfolio of businesses and their assets in comparison to our internal strategic and performance objectives 
as part of this review  we may acquire other businesses  further invest in  fully divest and or sell parts of our current businesses 
at february   the company had one sale and leaseback agreement for a building that provides an option to purchase the building at projected future fair market value upon expiration of the lease in the lease is classified as an operating lease 
the company had a deferred gain of million under this sale and leaseback transaction  which is included as accrued expenses and other long term liabilities 
the average annual lease payment over the life of the remaining lease is million 
financing activities 
total outstanding borrowings remained at million as of february  and february   and consisted solely of industrial development bonds 
total outstanding borrowings were million at the end of fiscal the fiscal amount consisted of million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and million of industrial development bonds 
the higher debt level at the end of fiscal was primarily due to borrowing to finance the purchase of tubelite  which we were able to pay off during fiscal with cash flow from operations 
our debt to total capital ratio was percent at the end of fiscal  down from percent at the end of fiscal  purely a function of the increased equity level in fiscal during fiscal  the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of  shares of common stock 
the board of directors increased this authorization by  shares in january and by  in october there were no share repurchases in fiscal we have purchased a total of  shares  at a total cost of million  since the inception of this program 
we have remaining authority to repurchase  shares under this program  which has no expiration date 

table of contents in addition to the shares repurchased under the repurchase plan  we also purchased million and million of company stock from employees pursuant to terms of board and shareholder approved compensation plans during fiscal and  respectively 
we paid million in dividends during the current year  compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in the dividend rate to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal other financing activities 
the following summarizes significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity future cash payments due by period in thousands thereafter total industrial revenue bonds operating leases undiscounted purchase obligations other obligations total cash obligations we maintain a million revolving credit facility which expires in november no borrowings were outstanding as of february  the credit facility requires that we maintain a minimum level of net worth as defined in the credit facility based on certain quarterly financial calculations 
the minimum required net worth computed in accordance with the credit agreement at february  was million  whereas our net worth as defined in the credit facility was million 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain a debt to cash flow ratio of no more than 
this ratio is computed daily  with cash flow computed on a rolling month basis 
our ratio was at february  if we are not in compliance with either of these covenants  the lender may terminate the commitment and or declare any loan then outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
at february   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the credit facility 
our long term debt consists of million of industrial development bonds that mature in fiscal years through from time to time  we acquire the use of certain assets  such as warehouses  automobiles  forklifts  vehicles  office equipment  hardware  software and some manufacturing equipment through operating leases 
many of these operating leases have termination penalties 
however  because the assets are used in the conduct of our business operations  it is unlikely that any significant portion of these operating leases would be terminated prior to the normal expiration of their lease terms 
therefore  we consider the risk related to termination penalties to be minimal 
as of february   we have purchase obligations totaling million  the majority of which are for raw material commitments 
the other obligations in the table above relate to non compete and consulting agreements with current and former employees 
we expect to make contributions of million to our defined benefit pension plans in fiscal the fiscal expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements 
as of february   we had million and million of unrecognized tax benefits and environmental liabilities  respectively 
we are unable to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
at february   we had ongoing letters of credit related to construction contracts and certain industrial development bonds 
the company s million of industrial revenue bonds are supported by million of letters of credit that reduce availability of funds under our million credit facility 
on april   million of recovery zone facility bonds were made available for future investment in architectural glass fabrication facilities 
as proceeds are received it will reduce availability under our million credit facility as the bonds are supported by a million letter of credit 
the letters of credit by expiration period were as follows at february  amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands thereafter total standby letters of credit 
table of contents in addition to the above standby letters of credit  which were predominantly issued for our industrial development bonds  we are required  in the ordinary course of business  to obtain a surety or performance bond that commits payments to our customers for any non performance by us 
at february   million of our backlog was bonded by performance bonds with a face value of million 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates  as we are released from the bonds upon completion of the contract 
we have never been required to pay on these performance based bonds with respect to any of our current portfolio of businesses 
we self insure our third party product liability coverages 
as a result  a material construction project rework event would have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
for fiscal  we believe that current cash on hand  cash generated from operating activities and available capacity under our committed revolving credit facility will be adequate to fund our working capital requirements  planned capital expenditures and dividend payments 
we had total cash and short term investments of million at february  we believe that this will provide us with the financial strength to work through the ongoing weak market conditions and to continue our growth strategy for the recovery 
off balance sheet arrangements 
with the exception of routine operating leases  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements at february  or february  outlook we continue to face an unprecedented level of uncertainty 
the following statements are based on current expectations for fiscal these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
overall revenues for the year are expected to be down to percent 
we have the potential for positive earnings per share 
capital expenditures are projected to be less than million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see new accounting standards set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future  which is incorporated by reference herein 
critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements and related notes  and believes those policies and estimates to be reasonable and appropriate 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies and estimates applied in the presentation of our financial statements relate to accounting for future events 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  management is required to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of potential loss 
we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to our business and in the understanding of our results of operations and financial position revenue recognition our standard product sales terms are free on board fob shipping point or fob destination  and revenue is recognized when title has transferred 
however  our installation business records revenue on a percentage of completion basis as it relates to revenues earned from construction contracts 
during fiscal  approximately percent of our consolidated sales and percent of our architectural segment sales were recorded on a percentage of completion basis 
under this methodology  we compare the total costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs for the contract  and record that proportion of the total contract revenue in the period 
contract costs include materials  labor and other direct costs related to contract performance 
provisions are established for estimated losses  if any  on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in contract revenue only when customers have approved them 
a significant number of estimates are used in these computations 
goodwill impairment to determine if there has been any impairment in accordance with accounting standards  we evaluate the goodwill on our balance sheet annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist through a two step process 
in step one  we value each of our reporting units and compare these values to the reporting units net book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the net book value  step two  which determines the amount of goodwill to impair  is performed 
we were not required to perform step two for fiscal although we consider public information for transactions made on similar businesses to ours  since there are few comparables  we primarily base our determination of fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology that involves significant judgments based upon projections of future performance 
in developing our discounted cash flow analysis  assumptions about future revenues and expenses  capital expenditures  and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and long term business plan for each of our reporting units 
these plans take into consideration numerous factors including 
table of contents historical experience  anticipated future economic conditions and growth expectations for the industries and end markets in which we participate 
these assumptions are determined over a five year long term planning period 
the five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated 
revenues and operating profit beyond the five year period are projected to grow at a nominal perpetual growth rate for all reporting units 
the discount rate calculations are determined by assuming a company beta  market premium risk  size premium  the cost of debt and debt to capital ratio of a market participant 
a significant change in the factors noted above could cause us to reduce the estimated fair value of some or all of our reporting units and recognize a corresponding impairment of our goodwill in connection with a future goodwill impairment test 
there can be no assurances that these forecasts will be attained 
adverse changes in strategy  market conditions or assumed market capitalization may result in an impairment of goodwill 
reserves for disputes and claims regarding product liability and warranties from time to time  we are subject to claims associated with our products and services  principally as a result of disputes with our customers involving the performance or aesthetics of our architectural products 
the time period from when a claim is asserted to when it is resolved  either by dismissal  negotiation  settlement or litigation  can be several years 
while we maintain product liability insurance  the insurance policies include significant self retention of risk in the form of policy deductibles 
in addition  certain claims could be determined to be uninsured 
we reserve based on our estimates of known claims  as well as on anticipated claims for possible product warranty and rework costs based on historical product liability claims as a ratio of sales 
self insurance reserves we obtain substantial amounts of commercial insurance for potential losses for general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  employment practices  architect s and engineer s errors and omissions risk  and other miscellaneous coverages 
however  an amount of risk is retained on a self insured basis through a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
reserve requirements are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses 
additionally  we maintain a self insurance reserve for our health insurance programs maintained for the benefit of our eligible employees 
we estimate a reserve based on historical levels of amounts for claims incurred but not reported 
stock based compensation we account for share based compensation by estimating the fair value of each share based payment award on the date of grant and  in the case of performance based awards  updating those values throughout the year and life of the award 
for these performance based awards  we estimate the future performance of the company as an input into the expense 
any change in the actual results from our assumptions could have a material impact on the company s operating results 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
as part of our ongoing financial reporting process  a collaborative effort is undertaken involving our management with responsibility for financial reporting  product and project management  quality  legal  tax and outside advisors such as consultants  engineers  lawyers and actuaries 
the results of this effort provide management with the necessary information on which to base its judgments on these future events and develop the estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying financial statements related to these events are based on the best estimates and judgments of apogee management 
however  outcomes could differ from our estimates and could materially adversely affect our future operating results  financial position and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk is sensitivity to interest rates  which is the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce net earnings of the company 
to manage our direct risk from changes in market interest rates  management actively monitors the interest sensitive components of our balance sheet  primarily debt obligations and fixed income securities  as well as market interest rates  in order to minimize the impact of changes in interest rates on net earnings and cash flow 
we have historically used interest rate swaps to fix a portion of our variable rate borrowings from fluctuations in interest rates 
during fiscal  we had interest rate swaps covering million of variable rate debt  which were terminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in a million pre tax charge to interest expense 

table of contents the interest rate swaps were designated as and were effective as cash flow hedges  and were included in the balance sheet with other long term liabilities  with changes in fair values included in other comprehensive income 
derivative gains and losses included in other comprehensive income were reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest expense was recognized  upon settlement or termination of the related commitment 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the primary measure of interest rate risk is the simulation of net income under different interest rate environments 
the approach used to quantify interest rate risk is a sensitivity analysis 
this approach calculates the impact on net earnings  relative to a base case scenario  of rates increasing or decreasing gradually over the next months by basis points 
this change in interest rates affecting our financial instruments at february  would result in approximately a million impact to net earnings 
the company s investments exceeded its debt at february  so as interest rates increase  net earnings increase  as interest rates decrease  net earnings decrease 
besides the market risk related to interest rate changes  the commercial construction markets in which our businesses operate are highly affected by changes in interest rates and  therefore  significant interest rate fluctuations could materially impact our operating results 
our investment portfolio consists of high quality commercial paper  us treasury bills  variable rate demand note vrdn securities and municipal bonds 
at february   we had total investments of million  which are considered available for sale securities 
although these investments are subject to the credit risk of the issuer and or letter of credit issuer  we manage our investment portfolio to limit our exposure to any one issuer 
because of the credit risk criteria of our investment policies and practices  the primary market risks associated with these investments are interest rate and liquidity risks 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a rise in interest rates could negatively affect the fair value of our municipal bond portfolio 
we generally do not have significant exposure to foreign exchange risk as the majority of our sales are within the united states and those outside the united states are generally denominated in us dollars
