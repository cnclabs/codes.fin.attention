item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview nike designs  develops and markets high quality footwear  apparel  equipment and accessory products worldwide 
we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts  nike owned retail  including stores and e commerce  independent distributors  franchisees and licensees worldwide 
our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear  apparel  equipment and accessories businesses 
our strategy is to achieve long term revenue growth by creating innovative  must have products  building deep personal consumer connections with our brands  and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences 
aside from achieving long term revenue growth  we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas making our supply chain a competitive advantage  through operational discipline  reducing product costs through a continued focus on lean manufacturing and product design that strives to eliminate waste  improving selling and administrative expense productivity by focusing on investments that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross margin  and leveraging existing infrastructure across our portfolio of brands to eliminate duplicative costs  improving working capital efficiency  and deploying capital effectively to create value for our shareholders 
through execution of this strategy  our long term financial goals continue to be high single digit revenue growth  mid teens earnings per share growth  increased return on invested capital and accelerated cash flows  and consistent results through effective management of our diversified portfolio of businesses 

table of contents since the adoption of this long term strategy in  nike  inc s revenues and earnings per share have grown and  respectively  on an annual compounded basis 
during the same period  our return on invested capital has increased from to 
while macroeconomic conditions in fiscal continued to remain challenging  putting significant pressure on consumer spending in most markets worldwide  we have continued to focus on achieving appropriate financial performance  while extending our market leadership and positioning ourselves for sustainable  profitable growth over the long term 
nike  inc s fiscal revenues declined to billion  net income increased to billion  and we delivered diluted earnings per share of  a increase versus fiscal our fiscal reported results contain significant non comparable transactions  including an after tax charge of million for restructuring activities  recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and an after tax charge of million for the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other assets of umbro  which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal excluding these non comparable items  our fiscal net income would have increased and diluted earnings per share would have increased compared to fiscal see reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding non comparable items below 
the increase in net income excluding non comparable items was primarily driven by an improved gross margin percentage and a reduction in our effective tax rate  which more than offset the reduction in revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses 
the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily the result of favorable product mix  cost reduction initiatives  lower input costs and sales growth in our nike owned retail business 
our year over year effective tax rate improvement was driven by continued benefit from our international businesses  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate 
the increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in performance based compensation as well as investments in our nike owned retail business  which more than offset reductions in compensation expense resulting from restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal for fiscal  diluted earnings per share grew at a slightly lower rate than net income given higher average outstanding shares 
in fiscal  we increased cash flow from operations as a result of working capital reductions  reflecting our efforts to aggressively manage inventory levels and accounts receivable collections 
at may   our inventory and accounts receivable balances were down and  respectively  compared to may  during fiscal  we also returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal although most of our businesses reported revenue declines in the first half of fiscal  the majority returned to growth in the second half of fiscal futures orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal increased as compared to the same periods in the prior year 
while we continue to believe that the company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective  our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world 
these conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways  including lower revenue from slowing consumer customer demand for our products  reduced profit margins and or increased costs  changes in interest and currency exchange rates  lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experienced by suppliers and customers 
our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions

fiscal compared to fiscal excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates  revenues for nike  inc declined  driven primarily by a decline in revenues for the nike brand 
all of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of emerging markets  reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets  most notably in our western europe and central and eastern europe geographies 
by product group  revenues for our worldwide nike brand footwear business were down compared to the prior year 
worldwide nike brand apparel and equipment revenues declined and  respectively 
while our wholesale business remains the largest component of our nike brand revenues  our nike owned retail business continues to grow  representing approximately of our total nike brand revenues in fiscal as compared to in fiscal revenues from our other businesses were comprised of results from cole haan  converse  inc  hurley international  llc  nike golf and umbro  ltd 
excluding the impact of currency changes  revenues for these businesses increased by for fiscal  driven by increased revenues at converse  umbro and hurley  which more than offset revenue declines at nike golf and cole haan 
futures orders translated into us dollars at prior year exchange rates  worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november were higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period 
this futures growth was driven by increases in unit sales volume for our footwear products and growth in average unit price for both of our apparel and footwear products 
futures orders increased when translated at forecasted exchange rates for the next six months  which approximate current spot rates 
the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period 
this is due to year over year changes in shipment timing  and because the mix of orders can shift between advance futures and at once orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advance futures orders and actual revenues 
moreover  a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders  including at once and close out sales of nike footwear and apparel  sales of nike equipment  sales from our other businesses and certain retail sales across all brands

umbro was acquired on march  revenues for these businesses were flat compared to fiscal gross margin fiscal fiscal fy vs 
fy change fiscal fy vs 
fy change in millions gross margin gross margin bps bps fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  our consolidated gross margin percentage was basis points higher than the prior year 
the primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows improved in line product margins across most geographies  driven by reduced raw material and freight costs as well as favorable changes in product mix  improved inventory positions  most notably in north america and western europe  which drove a shift in mix from discounted close out to higher margin in line sales  and growth of nike owned retail as a percentage of total revenue  across most nike brand geographies  driven by an increase in both new store openings and comparable store sales 
together  these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately basis points for fiscal these increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates  primarily affecting our emerging markets and central and eastern europe geographies 
we anticipate our gross margins in fiscal may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic factors including changes in currency exchange rates and rising costs for product input costs 
we also anticipate higher air freight costs as we work with our suppliers to meet increasing demand for certain running footwear products in the first half of the year 
fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  the primary factors contributing to the basis point decline in consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were lower gross pricing margins and increased discounts which  when combined  decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately basis points 
this decrease was partially offset by improved hedge rates relative to the prior year  primarily in the western europe and central and eastern europe geographies 
gross pricing margins were lower  primarily driven by higher product input costs  most notably for footwear products 
higher levels of discounts were provided across all businesses in fiscal to manage inventory levels

fiscal compared to fiscal changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense by percentage point in fiscal excluding changes in exchange rates  operating overhead expense increased compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performance based compensation and investments in nike owned retail 
these increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense 
demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year  as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising 
in fiscal  we will continue to focus our resources on those investments that drive sustainable and profitable growth 
we expect demand creation will increase at a slightly slower rate than revenues  with spending weighted toward the first quarter driven by key events including the world cup 
we anticipate operating overhead will grow at a mid single digit rate  with faster growth in the first half of the fiscal year  driven by increased investments in our nike owned retail business 
fiscal compared to fiscal changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by percentage points in fiscal excluding changes in exchange rates  operating overhead increased during fiscal the increase in operating overhead was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nike owned retail in the north america  western europe  greater china  and japan geographies  infrastructure for the emerging markets and central and eastern europe geographies as well as for our non nike brand businesses  which more than offset steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending  including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings 
on a constant currency basis  demand creation expense increased during fiscal demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities  most notably traditional media and print advertising 
the increase in demand creation during the first half of fiscal was primarily attributable to strategic investments  including first quarter spending around the beijing summer olympics and the european football championships  and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all geographies 
restructuring charges during fiscal  we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure  enhance consumer focus  drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure 
as a result 
table of contents of these actions  we reduced our global workforce by approximately and incurred pre tax restructuring charges of million in fiscal  primarily consisting of cash severance costs 
these charges are included in corporate for segment reporting purposes 
goodwill  intangible and other asset impairment in fiscal  we recognized a million pre tax non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of umbro s goodwill  intangible and other assets 
although umbro s financial performance for fiscal was slightly better than we had originally expected  projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition 
this erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets  particularly in the united kingdom  and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business 
we measured the fair value of umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies 
we believe the use of both models compensated for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis  and this combination was indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation 
the fair value of umbro s indefinite lived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method  which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark 
our assessments resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of million and million related to umbro s goodwill and trademark  respectively  in fiscal in addition to the impairment analysis  we determined an equity investment held by umbro was also impaired  and recognized a charge of million related to the impairment of that investment 
these charges are included in our other businesses category for segment reporting purposes

ebit for other businesses declined for fiscal primarily as a result of a million pre tax non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of umbro s goodwill intangible and other assets 
excluding the impairment charge  the loss of income from nike bauer hockey and the starter brand business along with the dilutive impact of umbro  earnings before interest and taxes for other businesses would have decreased by  driven by declines in operating results at nike golf and cole haan

corporate s loss before interest and taxes consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses  which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments  depreciation and amortization related to the company s corporate headquarters  unallocated insurance and benefit programs  certain foreign currency gains and losses  including certain hedge gains and losses  corporate eliminations and other items 
in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues  foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management

prior to fiscal  all foreign currency results  including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses  generated by the western europe and central and eastern europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  results for corporate included a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
excluding this restructuring charge  loss before interest and taxes for corporate would have increased by  primarily driven by an increase in performance based compensation 
fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in corporate s loss before interest and taxes in fiscal was primarily attributable to pre tax restructuring charges of million  consisting primarily of cash charges related to severance costs 
in fiscal  foreign currency conversion gains losses reported in corporate expense totaled million compared to million in fiscal  which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal versus a net hedge loss in fiscal foreign currency exposures and hedging practices overview as a global company with significant operations outside the us we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates in the normal course of business 
foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions  such as sales  purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in non functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations  financial position and cash flows into us dollars for consolidated reporting 
our primary foreign currency exposures are related to us dollar transactions at wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in euros  british pounds  chinese renminbi and japanese yen 
our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements  dependent upon hedge horizons 
we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally  on a portfolio basis  to manage those risks that are material to nike  inc on a consolidated basis 
we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and by hedging remaining material exposures  where practical  using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options 
the company s hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 
transactional exposures we transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary  which subjects us to foreign currency risk 
our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are inventory purchases most of our inventory purchases around the world are denominated in us dollars 
this generates foreign currency exposures for all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
a weaker us dollar reduces the inventory cost in the purchasing subsidiary s functional currency whereas a stronger us dollar increases the inventory cost 

table of contents non functional currency revenues a portion of our western europe geography revenues are earned in currencies other than the euro eg british pound  but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the euro as its functional currency  generating foreign currency exposure 
other revenues and costs non functional currency revenues and costs  such as endorsement contracts  intercompany royalties and other payments  generate foreign currency risk to a lesser extent 
non functional currency assets and liabilities our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities  primarily receivables and payables  that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
these balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in other income expense  net within our consolidated results of operations 
managing transactional exposures transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program 
as of may   we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows  including non functional currency revenues and expenses 
these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
the fair value of these instruments at may  and was million and million in assets and million and million in liabilities  respectively 
the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income oci  a component of shareholders equity  and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings 
the ineffective portion was a gain of million for the year ended may  the ineffective portion was immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense  net 
ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended may   and certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
in these cases  the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non functional currency asset or liability 
the fair value of these instruments at may  and was million and million in assets and million and million in liabilities  respectively 
the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings 
the impact of such instruments is included in other income expense  net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged 
refer to note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 
translational exposures substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting 
the translation of foreign subsidiaries non us dollar balance sheets into non us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders equity 
in preparing our consolidated statements of income  foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars 
in translation  a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings 
the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit detriment of approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended may  and approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended may  
table of contents managing translational exposures to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting  certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated available for sale investments 
the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at non us dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
we utilize forward contracts and options to partially  or entirely  hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments 
this has the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold 
hedges of available for sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of instruments used in this manner at may  and was million and million in assets  respectively 
there were no instruments in a liability position at may  or the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in oci and reclassified into earnings in other income expense  net in the period during which the hedged available for sale investment is sold and affects earnings 
any ineffective portion  which was not material for any period presented  is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense  net 
we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profits from our international businesses and the year over year change in foreign currency related gains included in other income expense  net had a favorable impact of approximately million and million on our income before income taxes for fiscal and  respectively 
refer to note risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 
net investments in foreign subsidiaries we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar  which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings 
during fiscal  we began to hedge certain net investment positions in euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings 
in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
any ineffective portion  which was not material for any period presented  is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense  net 
to minimize credit risk  we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration 
upon maturity  the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci  concurrent with settlement  we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate 
the fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at may  and were million in assets and million in liabilities  respectively 
cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled million and million in the years ended may  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow activity cash provided by operations was billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal was net income of billion as well as positive cash flows from working capital 
our working capital provided a net positive cash flow of billion for fiscal as compared to a net cash outflow of billion for fiscal the increase in cash flows from working capital 
table of contents was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  driven by timing of fourth quarter expenses  a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of a shorter collection cycle and slightly lower revenues  and a decrease in inventories  reflective of tighter inventory buys compared to fiscal cash used by investing activities was billion during fiscal  compared to billion for fiscal the year over year increase was primarily due to net purchases of short term investments of billion net of sales and maturities in fiscal compared to billion in net purchases of short term investments during fiscal also contributing to the year over year increase in cash used by investing activities in fiscal was a reduction in proceeds for the settlement of net investment hedges compared to the prior year period 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in cash used for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
cash used by financing activities was billion for fiscal compared to billion used in fiscal the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments of notes payable and long term debt as well as an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  we purchased million shares of nike s class b common stock for million 
during fiscal  we concluded our previous four year  billion share repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors in june during this program  we repurchased a total of million shares 
having completed the program  during the third quarter of fiscal  we began repurchases under the four year billion program approved by our board of directors in september of the total million shares repurchased during fiscal  million shares were repurchased under this program for million 
we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow  excess cash  and or debt 
the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements  we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights  coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor 
currently  we have several such agreements in place 
however  based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss  we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations our significant long term contractual obligations as of may   and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows cash payments due during the year ending may  description of commitment thereafter total in millions operating leases long term debt endorsement contracts product purchase obligations other total the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products 
actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for 
table of contents bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements and or royalties on product sales in future periods 
actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods 
in addition to the cash payments  we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use 
it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product 
the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions  the number of sporting events in which they participate  and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives 
in addition  the costs to design  develop  source  and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 
we generally order product at least to months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced futures orders received from customers 
the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business  that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms 
in some cases  prices are subject to change throughout the production process 
the reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheet as of may  other amounts primarily include service and marketing commitments made in the ordinary course of business 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms  including open purchase orders for non product purchases 
the reported amounts exclude those liabilities included in accounts payable or accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of may  the total liability for uncertain tax positions was million  excluding related interest and penalties  at may  we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the long term liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 
we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligations as of may  please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note short term borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the short term debt obligations listed below 
outstanding as of may  in millions notes payable  due at mutually agreed upon dates within one year of issuance or on demand payable to sojitz america for the purchase of inventories  generally due days after shipment of goods from a foreign port as of may   letters of credit of million were outstanding  generally for the purchase of inventory 
capital resources in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which million in debt securities may be issued 
as of may   no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration 
we may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
as of may   we had no amounts outstanding under our multi year  billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks 
the facility matures in december based on our current long term 
table of contents senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively  the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing london interbank offer rate libor plus 
the facility fee is of the total commitment 
if our long term debt rating were to decline  the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase 
conversely  if our long term debt rating were to improve  the facility fee and interest rate would decrease 
changes in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility 
under this committed credit facility  we have agreed to various covenants 
these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio 
in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility  failed to meet any covenant  and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks  any borrowings would become immediately due and payable 
as of may   we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 
liquidity is also provided by our billion commercial paper program 
as of may   no amounts were outstanding under this program 
we may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal depending on general corporate needs 
we currently have short term debt ratings of a and p from standard and poor s corporation and moody s investor services  respectively 
despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets  to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs 
future volatility in the capital markets  however  may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 
we believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated by operations  together with access to external sources of funds as described above  will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 
recently adopted accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
the guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  the valuation techniques and inputs used  the activity in level fair value measurements  and the transfers between levels   and of the fair value measurement hierarchy 
this guidance became effective for us beginning march   except for disclosures relating to purchases  sales  issuances and settlements of level assets and liabilities  which will be effective for us beginning june  as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures  the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see note fair value measurements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures required under this guidance 
in february  the fasb issued amended guidance on subsequent events 
under this amended guidance  sec filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements 
this guidance was effective immediately and we adopted these new requirements since the third quarter of fiscal in june  the fasb established the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the single source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap for all non governmental entities 
the codification  which launched july   changes the referencing and organization of accounting guidance 
the codification became effective for us beginning september  the issuance of fasb codification did not change gaap and therefore the adoption has only affected how specific references to gaap literature are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in april  the fasb updated guidance related to fair value measurements to clarify the guidance related to measuring fair value in inactive markets  to modify the recognition and measurement of other than temporary impairments of debt securities  and to require public companies to disclose the fair values of financial instruments in interim periods 
this updated guidance became effective for us beginning june  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see note fair value measurements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures required under the updated guidance 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance applicable when determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this guidance clarifies that share based payment awards that entitle their holders to receive non forfeitable dividends before vesting should be considered participating securities and included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method 
this guidance became effective for us beginning june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or earnings per share 
in april  the fasb issued amended guidance regarding the determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
the guidance amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
the intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset 
this guidance became effective for us beginning june  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued amended guidance regarding business combinations  establishing principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  any resulting goodwill  and any non controlling interest in an acquiree in its financial statements 
this guidance also provides for disclosures to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
this amended guidance became effective for us beginning june  the adoption of this amended guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements  but could impact the accounting for future business combinations 
in december  the fasb issued new guidance regarding the accounting and reporting for non controlling interests in subsidiaries 
this guidance clarifies that non controlling interests in subsidiaries should be accounted for as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity 
this guidance became effective for us beginning june  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables 
these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are effective for us beginning june  we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities vie 
this new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this guidance is effective for us beginning june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard 

table of contents critical accounting policies our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policies for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves  and contingent payments under endorsement contracts 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
revenue recognition we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
in certain countries outside of the us  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location 
on the basis of our tests of actual transactions  we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns  discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded 
we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns  discounts and claims  and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
actual returns  discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns  discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
since we cannot predict 
table of contents future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
contingent payments under endorsement contracts a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts 
in general  endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract 
however  certain contract elements may be accounted for differently  based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 
some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg  winning a championship 
we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 
some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg  maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year 
these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period 
in these instances  to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser s athletic performance  increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 
some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products 
we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur 
in certain contracts  we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments 
for contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product  we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 
property  plant and equipment and definite lived assets property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset s net book value to its salvage value 
we review the carrying value of long lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in 
table of contents which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  among others 
if such facts indicate a potential impairment  we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group 
if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable  we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows 
any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or when events occur or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value 
events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate  operating results  planned investments in the reporting unit  or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  among other factors 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis 
in step two of the analysis  we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 
we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future 
our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital  long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit s business  and working capital effects 
the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business 
significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size  growth  profitability  risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 
we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry  and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand alone basis 
indefinite lived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks 
in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method 
this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them 
this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands  the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 
hedge accounting for derivatives we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain resulting receivable or payable balances 
when specific criteria for hedge accounting have been met  changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income 
in most cases  this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into 
table of contents net income some time after the maturity of the derivative 
one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions 
by their very nature  our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions 
when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels  or when it is not probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter  we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense  net during the quarter in which such changes occur 
once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels  we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 
we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
when appropriately designated as a hedge  the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments 
as the value of our underlying net investments in wholly owned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed  the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk 
accordingly  the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness 
we consider  on a quarterly basis  the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment 
should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels  any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility 
expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year  along with other factors 
our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 
in addition  we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

table of contents we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore  and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation 
despite this approach  because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated 
for instance  the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations  or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 
conversely  our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore 
in this case  our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items  to determine the year to date tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur 
as the fiscal year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
on a quarterly basis  we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  settled audit issues and new audit activity 
changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes 
we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other income expense  net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses  we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures  we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates 
it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures  we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales  product sourcing and funding activities 
our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash 
table of contents flows 
this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons 
we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party and intercompany transactions 
we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 
when we begin hedging exposures  the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions 
generally  all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within to months 
the majority of the contracts expiring in more than months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory 
when intercompany loans are hedged  it is typically for their expected duration 
hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros  japanese yen and british pounds 
see section foreign currency exposures and hedging practices under item for additional detail 
our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and long term market interest rates 
our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a mix of commercial paper  bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receive fixed  pay variable interest rate swaps 
market risk measurement we monitor foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value  sensitivity analysis  and value at risk var 
our market sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts  foreign currency option contracts  interest rate swaps  intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt  and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 
we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only 
the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instruments 
the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a confidence level 
there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation 
our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a variance co variance technique 
these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period 
the value of foreign currency options does not change on a one to one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate 
we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate 
this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non functional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions  firm commitments  cash balances  and accounts and loans receivable and payable  including those which are hedged by these instruments 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates 
it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur 
actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships  hedging instruments and hedge percentages  timing and other factors 
the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments  derived using the var model  was million and million at may  and  respectively 
the var decreased year over year as a result of reduced total notional value of our foreign 
table of contents currency derivative portfolio combined with decreased foreign currency volatilities at may  such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 
the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in non functional currencies  fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt  fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps 
intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation 
furthermore  our non functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts  which are included in the var calculation above 
we  therefore  consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non functional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position  results from operations and cash flows 
details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may  expected maturity date year ending may  thereafter total fair value in millions  except interest rates foreign exchange risk japanese yen functional currency japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate interest rate risk japanese yen functional currency long term japanese yen debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate us dollar functional currency long term us dollar debt fixed rate swapped to floating rate principal payments average interest rate long term us dollar debt fixed rate principal payments average interest rate the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries 
accordingly  the monthly translation of these instruments  which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates  is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary
