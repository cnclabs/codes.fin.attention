the increase in europe was primarily attributable to expanded activities in the middle east and africa as well as an increase in salaries and related benefits costs also related to an increase in sales force 
the increase in asia pacific was attributable to general cost increases associated with the increase in revenue level 
the company s increase in sales force began in the second half of and carried forward into early in an effort to maintain or increase revenues and market share while facing a downturned economy 
results of this increase  specifically in the united states and europe  did not have the expected outcome and this  combined with the continued unfavorable impact on the company s operations as a result of the economic downturn  resulted in the company s decision to undertake a cost reduction initiative in late to realign selling  general and administrative costs with its current level of operations

interest expense for the year ended december   consolidated interest expense decreased by million when compared to the same period for the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  was due to a decrease in average outstanding debt and interest rates for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   consolidated interest expense decreased by million  or  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense is due to the conversion and payoff of the company s subordinated debentures which matured january  as well as a decrease in outstanding debt and in interest rates from december  to december  during  payments on debt totaled million 
during  million of the debentures were converted into  shares of the company s common stock and million of the debentures were converted into  shares of the company s common stock during the first half of january the remaining million of subordinated debentures matured and were paid in full in january income taxes the company maintains a valuation allowance to adjust the basis of net deferred tax assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc income taxes 
as a result  substantially all net deferred tax assets attributable to us federal income taxes  as well as certain state and foreign income taxes  recorded for the years ended december   and were fully reserved 
the income tax expense recorded for the years ended december   and consisted primarily of income taxes due in foreign and state jurisdictions of the company 
income tax expense differs from the expected tax at statutory rates due primarily to the change in valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and different tax rates in the various foreign jurisdictions 
additionally  the aggregate tax expenses are not consistent when comparing periods due to the changing income tax mix between domestic and foreign operations and within the foreign operations 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance on domestic federal and certain state and foreign income taxes was required  the company primarily considered factors such as the history of operating losses and the nature of the deferred tax assets 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the change in the rates is related to changes in the mix of taxable income  between countries whose taxes are offset by full valuation allowances and those that are not 
the income generated in certain foreign countries is taxable in  while losses in the us and certain other foreign countries is not tax effected 
this  along with the low level of pre tax income  resulted in an extremely high effective tax rate in the most significant factor impacting the variability in tax rates relates to foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
for the year ended december   the company s united kingdom subsidiary recognized approximately million of foreign currency transaction gains compared to approximately million in foreign 
table of contents currency transaction losses for the year ended december   primarily related to us dollar denominated notes outstanding under the company s previous credit agreement 
during these same periods  us based subsidiaries of the company recognized foreign currency transaction losses in and gains in substantially offsetting the impact of the currency transaction gains and losses in the united kingdom  however income tax expenses and benefits in the united kingdom related to these gains and losses were not offset as the us transaction gains and losses had no tax effect due to the aforementioned valuation allowance on the company s us federal taxes

in addition  income taxes payable increased cash flow by million for the year ended december  compared to an decrease of million for the year ended december  this change was due to timing of estimated payments made on current year tax liabilities combined with refunds received in the current year on prior year overpayments  primarily in the united kingdom

such expenditures  however  will depend on many factors beyond the company s control  including  without limitation  demand for services as well as domestic and foreign government regulations 
no assurance can be given that required capital expenditures will not exceed anticipated amounts during or thereafter 
capital expenditures during the year are expected to be funded from existing cash and anticipated cash flows from operations 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash used for financing activities resulted from net principal payments made on the company s credit facility totaling million and debt issuance cost payments on a new credit facility of million in the year ended december   compared to million of principal payments made on its credit facility and million of payments made related to the final conversions of the company s convertible subordinated debentures in the year ended december  the company entered into a new credit facility in described in more detail below  receiving borrowings of million from the new facility  and paid its remaining outstanding principal balance of million upon the termination of the previous credit facility

the ultimate timing and extent of the crisis cannot be predicted  and as such  the company believes that the risks to its business in this environment remain heightened
