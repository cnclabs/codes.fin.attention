actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions  impacting the reported results of operations and financial position 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report

net sales revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue on product sales in the period in which the sales process is complete 
this generally occurs when products are shipped fob origin to the customer in accordance with the terms of the sale  the risk of loss has been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured and the pricing is fixed and determinable 
at the end of each period  for those shipments where title to the products and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer  the company adjusts revenues and cost of sales for the delay between the time that the products are shipped and when they are received by the customer 
the company s distribution channels are primarily through direct sales and independent third party distributors 
revenue billing the company accepts orders from customers based on long term purchasing contracts and written sales agreements 
contract pricing and selling agreement terms are based on market factors  costs  and competition 
pricing normally is negotiated as an adjustment premium or discount from the company s published price lists 
the customer is invoiced when the company s products are shipped to them in accordance with the terms of the sales agreement 
returns credits some of the terms of the company s sales agreements and normal business conditions provide customers distributors the ability to receive price adjustments on products previously shipped and invoiced 
this practice is common in the industry and is referred to as a ship and debit program 
this program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between the distributors contracted price and a lower price for specific transactions 
under certain circumstances usually in a competitive situation or large volume opportunity  a distributor will request authorization to reduce its price to its buyer 
if the company approves such a reduction  the distributor is authorized to debit its account for the difference between the contracted price and the lower approved price 
the company establishes reserves for this program based on historic activity and actual authorizations for the debit and recognizes these debits as a reduction of revenue 
the company has a return to stock policy whereby a customer with previous authorization from littelfuse management can return previously purchased goods for full or partial credit 
the company establishes an estimated allowance for these returns based on historic activity 
sales revenue and cost of sales are reduced to anticipate estimated returns 
the company properly meets all of the criteria for recognizing revenue when the right of return exists 
specifically  the company meets those requirements because the company s selling price is fixed or determinable at the date of the sale 
the company has policies and procedures to accept only credit worthy customers with the ability to pay the company 
the company s customers are obligated to pay the company under the contract and the obligation is not contingent on the resale of the product 
all ship and debit and returns to stock require specific circumstances and authorization 
the risk ownership transfers to the company s customers upon shipment and is not changed in the event of theft  physical destruction or damage of the product 

table of contents the company bills at the ship date and establishes a reserve to reduce revenue from the in transit time until the product is delivered for fob destination sales 
the company s customers acquiring the product for resale have economic substance apart from that provided by littelfuse 
all distributors are independent of the company 
the company does not have any obligations for future performance to bring about resale of the product by its customers 
the company can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
volume rebates the company offers incentives to certain customers to achieve specific quarterly or annual sales targets 
if customers achieve their sales targets  they are entitled to rebates 
the company estimates the future cost of these rebates and recognizes this estimated cost as a reduction to revenue as products are sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
the company regularly analyzes its significant customer accounts and  when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific reserve for bad debt to reduce the related receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes is collectible 
the company also records allowances for all other customers based on a variety of factors including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  macroeconomic considerations and past experience 
historically  the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover bad debts 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  the estimates of the recoverability of receivables could be further adjusted 
inventory the company performs regular detailed assessments of inventory  which include a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  shelf life and quality issues 
based on the analysis  the company records adjustments to inventory for excess quantities  obsolescence or impairment when appropriate to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
historically  inventory reserves have been adequate to reflect inventory at net realizable values 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company annually tests goodwill for impairment on the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter or at an interim date if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates the asset may be impaired 
management determines the fair value of each of its business unit segments by using a discounted cash flow model which includes forecasted five year income statement and working capital projections  a market based weighted average cost of capital and terminal values after five years to estimate market value 
in addition  the company compares its derived enterprise value on a consolidated basis to the company s market capitalization as of its test date to ensure its derived value approximates the market value of the company when taken as a whole 
the company has defined its reportable segments as its reporting units for goodwill accounting 
as of the most recent annual test conducted on september   the company concluded the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value of invested capital and therefore  no goodwill impairment existed 
specifically  the company noted that its headroom  defined as the excess of fair value over the carrying value of invested capital  was  and for its electronics  automotive and electrical reporting units  respectively  at september  certain key assumptions used in the annual test included a discount rate of and a long term growth rate of for all three business units

table of contents the company will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test as required on an annual basis and on an interim basis  if certain conditions exist 
factors the company considers important  which could result in changes to its estimates  include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results and declines in acquisitions and trading multiples 
due to the diverse end user base and non discretionary product demand  the company does not believe its future operating results will vary significantly relative to its historical and projected future operating results 
long lived assets the company evaluates long lived asset groups on an ongoing basis 
long lived asset groups are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the related asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if it is determined to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company s estimates of future cash flows from such assets could be impacted if it underperforms relative to historical or projected future operating results 
environmental liabilities environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of the probability of potential future environmental exposure 
expenses related to on going maintenance of environmental sites are expensed as incurred 
if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed the company s recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred

actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and credits are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
accounting for pensions requires estimating the future benefit cost and recognizing the cost over the employee s expected period of employment with the company 
certain assumptions are required in the calculation of pension costs and obligations 
these assumptions include the discount rate  salary scales and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the discount rate is intended to represent the rate at which pension benefit obligations could be settled by purchase of an annuity contract 
these assumptions are subject to change based on stock and bond market returns and other economic factors 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect its recognized expense and accrued liability in such future periods 
while the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate given current economic conditions and its actual experience  significant differences in results or significant changes in the company s assumptions may materially affect its pension obligations and related future expense 
further information regarding these plans is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report
