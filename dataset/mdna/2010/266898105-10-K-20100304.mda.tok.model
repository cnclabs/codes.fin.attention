item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in the section entitled risk factors 
we are a vertically integrated dermatology company that is developing and marketing levulan pdt and other products for common skin conditions 
our marketed products include levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt  the blu u brand light source  and clindareach 
we devote most of our resources to advancing the development and marketing of our levulan pdt technology platform 
in addition to our marketed products  our drug  levulan brand of aminolevulinic acid hcl  or ala  in combination with light  has been studied in a broad range of medical conditions 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to treat a medical condition  it is known as levulan pdt 
the kerastick is our proprietary applicator that delivers levulan 
the blu u is our patented light device 
the levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt and the blu u were launched in the united states  or us  in september for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp under a former dermatology collaboration 
aks are precancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure that can develop over time into a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma 
in addition  in september we received clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to market the blu u without levulan pdt for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions 
sirius laboratories  inc  or sirius  a dermatology specialty pharmaceuticals company  was founded in with a primary focus on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
nicomide was its key product  a vitamin mineral product prescribed by dermatologists 
we merged with sirius in march we are marketing levulan pdt under an exclusive worldwide license of patents and technology from parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  canada 
in january   we filed a request for reexamination with the uspto of one of the queen s patents that cover our approved indication for ak 
we responded to the first office action on october  we also own or license certain other patents relating to our blu u device and methods for using pharmaceutical formulations which contain our drug and related processes and improvements 
in the united states  dusa  dusa pharmaceuticals  inc  levulan  kerastick  blu u  nicomide  nicomide t  clindareach  meted  and psoriacap are registered trademarks 
several of these trademarks are also registered in europe  australia  canada  and in other parts of the world 
numerous other trademark applications are pending 

table of contents we are responsible for manufacturing our levulan kerastick and for the regulatory  sales  marketing  and customer service and other related activities for all of our products  including our levulan kerastick 
in february  we incurred a loss on the purchase of one of our non pdt drug products that was in transit having an approximate cost of  we have not yet determined the financial statement impact as we are evaluating our insurance coverage 
transactions the following significant transactions occurred during river s edge litigation settlement in april  we and river s edge entered into an amendment to a license agreement  or license amendment 
the license amendment grants river s edge an exclusive license to us patent  no 
 and a license to use all know how and the trademark associated with the licensed products worldwide 
under the license amendment  we are required to transfer all of our rights  title and interest in and to dusa s patent  know how and trademark relating to the licensed products but not the copyright registration relating to product labeling to river s edge upon our receipt of  of the  river s edge is required to make payment to us of  in thirteen monthly installments of  subject to reduction under certain conditions  and pay additional consideration of  payable over time based on a share of river s edge s net revenues as defined in the license amendment 
the original license agreement  entered into in august  or license agreement  as now amended  has a term of months  subject to a further extension under certain circumstances to months  and may be terminated early by river s edge on days prior written notice 
under the license agreement  river s edge has assumed all regulatory responsibilities for the licensed products 
if the license agreement is terminated prior to the payment of the  all of the rights and licenses granted by us to river s edge will revert to us 
we are recording the revenue under the license amendment on a cash basis 
we received the first  installment payment under the license amendment during the second quarter of  which is included in product revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  but have not received any further payments 
we are considering our options relative to the collection of amounts due from river s edge and termination of the license agreement  which we have the right to do for non payment 
winston laboratories arbitration settlement in october  we were notified that winston laboratories  inc had filed a demand for arbitration against us 
the demand for arbitration arose out of the micanol license agreement and subsequent micanol transition license agreement and claimed that we had breached the agreements 
winston laboratories claimed damages in excess of million 
the matter was settled on april  for cash consideration of  and a mutual release 
third amendment to the sirius merger agreement in april  we and the former shareholders of sirius entered into a letter agreement providing for the consent of the former sirius shareholders to the license amendment with river s edge mentioned above  a release  and a third amendment to the merger agreement  dated as of december   by and among the dusa pharmaceuticals  inc  sirius and the shareholders of sirius 
pursuant to the merger agreement prior to this amendment  we agreed to pay additional consideration after the closing of the merger to the former shareholders of sirius based upon the attainment of pre determined total cumulative sales milestones for the products acquired from sirius over the period ending months from the date of the march closing of the merger 
pursuant to the agreements entered into in april  we agreed to extend the milestone termination date from months from the date of the closing of the merger until december  and to include in the definition of net sales in the merger agreement payments which we may receive from the divestiture of sirius products 
the third amendment to the merger agreement also removes our obligation to market the sirius products according to certain previously required standards and allows us to manage all business activities relating to the products acquired from sirius without further approval from the former sirius shareholders 
in april  we paid to the former sirius shareholders  on a pro rata basis   in addition  in the event that the  milestone payment that would become due to the former sirius shareholders under the merger agreement if cumulative net sales of the sirius products reach  is not  in fact  triggered by the new milestone termination date  then we have agreed to pay  to the former sirius shareholders on a pro rata basis on or before january  
table of contents national biological corporation amended and restated purchase and supply agreement on june   we signed an amended and restated purchase and supply agreement with national biological corporation  or nbc  the principal manufacturer of our blu u light source 
this agreement permits us to order on a purchase order basis without minimums  and includes other modifications of the original agreement providing both parties greater flexibility related to the development and manufacture of light sources and the associated technology within the field of pdt 
on june   we extended the term of the agreement with nbc until june  we have an option to further extend the term for an additional two years if we purchase a certain number of units 
the parties agreed upon a tiered price schedule based on the volume of purchases and updated certain quality control provisions 
all other terms and conditions of the agreement remain in effect 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition accounting for revenue transactions relies on certain estimates that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments on the part of management 
pdt revenue revenues on kerastick and blu u product sales in the us and canada are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
we offer programs that allow physicians access to our blu u device for a trial period 
no revenue is recognized on these units until the physician elects to purchase the equipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
our terms with customers do not provide for the right of return for sales of kerastick and blu u  unless the product does not comply with the technical specifications 
for revenues associated with contractual agreements with multiple elements  the company applies the revenue recognition criteria outlined in securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition sab topic and asc  multiple element arrangements 
we analyze each contract in order to separate each deliverable into separate units of accounting  if applicable  and then recognize revenue for those separated units as earned 
significant judgment is required in determining the units of accounting and the attribution method for such arrangements 
we have entered into exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreements with distributors in latin america and korea that contain multiple deliverables 
the deliverables are treated as a single unit of accounting 
we have determined the attribution method for each of the separate payment streams 
under the terms of these agreements  we receive non refundable milestone payments  a fixed price per unit sold and royalties based on a percentage of the net sales price to end users 
we defer and recognize the approval and sales milestones as license revenues on a straight line basis  beginning on the date the milestone is achieved through term of the agreement 
we record royalty revenue when earned  which is upon sell through to the end user 
we record the fixed price per unit sold once the price is fixed and determinable  which is upon sell through to the end user 
additionally  we do not have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace 
the agreements require the distributors to make minimum purchases 
if minimum purchase obligations are not fulfilled  the distributors are required to pay the difference between its actual purchases and the contractual minimums a gross up payment 
we record revenue for the gross up payment upon cash receipt 
to date  stiefel  the distributor in latin america  has failed to meet its contractual obligations and is required to make the gross up payment  we have not received payment to date 
for daewoong  the distributor in asia pacific  the minimum purchase commitment is measured over a five year period  which has not yet ended 

table of contents non pdt revenue we recognize revenue for sales of non pdt drug products when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which generally occurs on the date of shipment to wholesale customers 
revenue is recognized net of revenue reserves  which consist of allowances for discounts  returns  rebates  chargebacks and fees paid to wholesalers under distribution service agreements 
we evaluate inventory levels at our wholesaler customers through an analysis that considers  among other things  wholesaler purchases  wholesaler shipments to retailers  available end user prescription data obtained from third parties and on hand inventory data received directly from our three largest wholesaler customers 
we believe that this evaluation of wholesaler inventory levels  allows us to make reasonable estimates for our applicable revenue related reserves 
additionally  our products are sold to wholesalers with a product shelf life that allows sufficient time for our wholesaler customers to sell the products in their inventory through to retailers and  ultimately  to end user consumers prior to product expiration 
for new product launches where we do not have the ability to reliably estimate returns  revenue is recognized based on end user demand  which is typically based on dispensed subscription data  or ship through data as reported by our international distribution partners 
when inventories have been reduced to targeted stocking levels at wholesalers or distribution partners  and we have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace which allows us to estimate product returns  we recognize revenue upon shipment  net of discounts and allowances 
we account for sales returns by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned 
we determine the estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales and related returns and incorporating other factors that could impact sales returns in the future 
these other factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated shelf life  product recalls  product discontinuances  price changes of competitive products  introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products 
our policy is to accept returns when product is within six months of expiration 
we consider all of these factors and adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
our reserve for sales returns has declined as revenues from non pdt drug products have declined 
chargebacks typically occur when suppliers enter into contractual pricing arrangements with end user customers  including certain federally mandated programs  who then purchase from wholesalers at prices below what the supplier charges the wholesaler 
since we only offer preferred pricing to end user customers under federally mandated programs  chargebacks have not been significant 
our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following two types medicaid rebates and consumer rebates 
medicaid rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
consumer rebates are amounts owed as a result of mail in coupons that are distributed by health care providers to consumers at the time a prescription is written 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we use sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory reserves  if any  that are necessary at each balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
at december  and  respectively  total property  plant and equipment had a net carrying value of  and  including  at december  associated with our manufacturing facility 
in we made a cash payment of million to former sirius shareholders as additional consideration for a cumulative sales milestone 
as this payment was deemed additional consideration related to the acquisition  we recorded goodwill in the amount of million and immediately recorded an impairment charge to the statement of operations for the same amount 
in we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million  which represented the entire goodwill 
table of contents balance related to the sirius acquisition and was all associated with the non pdt drug products reporting unit 
while we do not have any goodwill on the balance sheet at december   we may incur future goodwill impairment charges if we are required to make additional payments to former sirius shareholders 
the pre determined cumulative sales milestones for the sirius products and the related milestone payments which may be paid in cash or shares  as we may determine  are as follows additional cumulative sales milestone consideration million million million million total million in april  we entered into the third amendment to the merger agreement  or third amendment  as described in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as consideration for the third amendment and related documents  we paid the former sirius shareholders  on a pro rata basis and have guaranteed a payment of  in january if the  sales milestone is not triggered 
share based compensation we measure all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value based method and record share based compensation expense in our financial statements if the requisite service to earn the award is provided 
we recognize the expense attributable to stock awards as the awards vest in the consolidated statements of operations 
we issue stock options and unvested shares 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes option valuation model  which incorporates assumptions as to stock volatility  the expected life of the options  a risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the fair value of unvested shares is normally the price per share of our common stock on the date of grant 
share based compensation expense is not recorded if the awards do not vest 
accordingly we estimate the forfeitures in determining the share based compensation expense to record for the period 
if our actual forfeiture experience differs from our estimate  share based compensation expense will be adjusted 
financial instruments financial instruments recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets include cash equivalents  marketable securities and the common stock purchase warrant liability 
fair value is based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we follow the fair value disclosure hierarchy  that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels  which are described below level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level primarily consists of financial instruments whose value is based on quoted market prices such as exchange traded instruments and listed equities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
level includes financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
level is comprised of financial instruments whose fair value is estimated based on internally developed models or methodologies utilizing significant inputs that are generally less readily observable 
our cash equivalents are level instruments 
the fair value is based on transacted prices in an active market 
in determining the fair value of our marketable securities  we consider the level of market activity and the availability of prices for the specific securities that we hold 
for our level financial instruments  comprising our corporate debt and united states government backed securities  we use quoted market prices  broker or dealer quotations  or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency in the determination of value 
we also access publicly available market activity from third party databases and credit ratings of the issuers of the securities we hold to corroborate the data used in the fair value calculations obtained from our primary source 
we take into account credit rating changes  if any  of the securities or recent marketplace activity 
we do not have any level marketable securities 
the warrant liability is a level instrument 
we initially recorded the warrant liability at its fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and revalue it at each reporting date until the warrants are exercised or expire 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reported in our statements of operations as non operating income or expense under the caption loss gain on change in fair value of warrants 
the fair value of the warrants is subject to significant fluctuation based on changes in our stock price  expected volatility  remaining contractual life and the risk free interest rate 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
consequently  future fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause significant increases or decreases in the fair value of the warrants 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenues total revenues for were  as compared to  in and were comprised of the following year ended december  increase decrease pdt product revenues levulan kerastick product revenues united states canada korea rest of world subtotal levulan kerastick product revenues blu u product revenues united states canada korea subtotal blu u product revenues total pdt product revenues total non pdt drug product revenues total product revenues for the year ended december   total pdt drug and device products revenues  comprised of revenues from our kerastick and blu u products  were  this represents an increase of  or  over the comparable total of  the incremental revenue was driven primarily by increased kerastick revenues and blu u revenues in the united states 
for the year ended december   kerastick revenues were  representing an increase of  or  over the comparable totals of  kerastick unit sales to end users for the year ended december  were  including  sold in canada and  sold in korea 
this represents an increase from  kerastick units sold in the year ended december   including  sold in canada and  sold in korea 
our average net selling price for the kerastick increased to for the year ended december  from in our average net selling price for the kerastick includes sales made directly to our end user customers  as well as sales made to our distributors  in canada  korea and the rest of the world 
the increase in kerastick revenues was driven mainly by increased sales volumes in the united states along with an increase in our overall average unit selling price 
for the year ended december   blu u revenues were  an increase of  or  over blu u revenues of  the slight increase in blu u revenues was driven by increased sales volumes which were offset by a decrease in our average selling price 
in the year ended december   there were units sold  as compared to units in the total consists of sold in the united states and one sold in canada 
the total consists of units sold in the united states and in korea by daewoong 
our average net selling price for the blu u decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for our blu u evaluation program allows customers to take delivery for a limited number of blu u units for a period of up to four months for private practitioners and up to one year for hospital clinics  before we require a purchase decision 
at december   there were approximately units in the field pursuant to this evaluation program  compared to units in the field at december  the units are classified as inventory in the financial statements and are being amortized during the evaluation period to cost of goods sold using an estimated life for the equipment of three years 
we have to continue to demonstrate the clinical value of our unique therapy  and the related product benefits as compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
we are aware that physicians are using levulan with the blu u using short incubation times  and with light devices manufactured by other companies  and for uses other than our fda approved use 
while we are not permitted to market our products for so called off label uses  we believe that these activities are positively affecting the sales of our products 

table of contents non pdt drug product revenues reflect the revenues generated by the products acquired as part of our acquisition of sirius 
total non pdt drug product revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the substantial majority of the non pdt drug product revenues were from nicomide related royalties from river s edge  and sales of clindareach 
during  royalties from our license of the avar product line will cease under the terms of our license agreement with river s edge relating to these products 
in april  we were notified by actavis totowa  llc  the manufacturer of nicomide  that actavis would cease manufacturing several prescription vitamins  including nicomide  due to continuing discussions with the fda 
in response to this notification and subsequent discussions with the fda  we stopped the sale and distribution of nicomide in june the increase in our total revenues in compared with results primarily from increased pdt segment revenues in the united states  partially offset by decreases in international pdt revenues and non pdt revenues 
we must continue to increase sales from these levels in order for us to become profitable on an annual basis 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to increase sales sufficiently to become profitable on an annual basis  and we cannot provide assurance that a material increase in sales will necessarily cause us to be profitable on an annual basis 
photocure received fda approval to market metvixia for treatment of aks in july  and this pdt product  which is directly competitive with our levulan kerastick product  is now commercially available 
on october   photocure announced that it had sold metvix metvixia to galderma  sa  a large dermatology company 
on january   galderma announced a co promotion agreement with photomedex for metvixia under which galderma will provide marketing support and distribution 
photomedex s sales force will promote metvixia and galderma s aktilite lamp to healthcare professionals throughout the united states 
while we are entitled to royalties on net sales of metvixia  galderma and photomedex together have considerably more resources than we have  which could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share 
during  our pdt segment revenues in the united states grew  due in part to the increase in medicare reimbursement of our pdt related procedure fee  which became effective january   as well as our pricing strategies 
although we expect growth in our pdt segment revenues  we are susceptible to the uncertain economic conditions  particularly with our customer base in the us and internationally where our product lacks reimbursement  and to increased competition particularly from metvixia 
reduced sales on non reimbursed procedures and softness in the international markets could be expected until the economy recovers 
we expect our non pdt revenues for to be reduced from levels since we are experiencing difficulty collecting payments due under the license agreement with river s edge 
also see the section entitled risk factors any failure to comply with government regulations in the united states and elsewhere will limit our ability to market our products and become profitable

our long term goal is to achieve higher gross margins on kerastick sales which will be significantly dependent on increased volume 
we believe that we could achieve improved gross margins on our kerastick from further volume growth and price increases in the us blu u margins for the year ended december  were  as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin is a result of increased sales volumes  partially offset by a decrease in our average selling price 
it is important for us to sell blu u units in an effort to drive kerastick sales volumes and accordingly  we may sell blu u s at low profit margins 
non pdt gross margins reflect the gross margin generated by the products acquired as part of our merger with sirius 
total non pdt gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  non pdt margins in were negatively impacted by our discontinuance of sales of nicomide 
research and development costs research and development costs for were  as compared to  in the decrease in compared to was due was due primarily to the absence of spending related to our phase iib clinical trial on acne  which concluded in october  and a one time  prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa charge  which occurred in the first quarter of  related to our approved ak indication 
based on the results of the phase iib clinical trial  which were previously announced  we will not pursue further clinical development of levulan pdt with blu u for moderate to severe acne 
however  we do expect to continue to support investigator initiated studies in moderate to severe acne with levulan and various light sources 
in may  we filed a k application with the fda for an expansion of our blu u label to include severe acne 
we previously had filed a patent application to cover an invention arising from the study 
we received a response to our k application from the fda in june the agency requested additional information in order to complete its review of our application  which included supplementary clinical data in support of our claims 
based on the fda s requests and the anticipated costs of additional clinical trials  we have decided that we will not pursue the k application for an expansion of our blu u claims at this time 
we have initiated a dusa sponsored phase ii clinical trial  for the treatment of actinic keratoses and reduction in the incidence of non melanoma skin cancers in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients  or sotrs  who have demonstrated that they are at risk of developing multiple squamous cell carcinomas 
we expect to enroll up to patients at seven clinical trial sites across the united states 
we expect enrollment of these patients to take at least one year  to receive preliminary results from the study in approximately months and full results in approximately two years 
to date  the pace of enrollment in the study has been slower than we anticipated at the outset of the trial 
in may  we filed an orphan drug designation application with the fda for the prevention of cancer occurrence in these patients 
we received initial correspondence that the application was not granted on the basis that the agency believed that the prevalence of the target population with the disease state is greater than  which is the maximum number of patients allowed under the orphan drug legislation 
we met with the fda during the third quarter of to clarify and explain further our application and  based on that meeting  the agency invited us to submit an amendment to our application for further evaluation 
we submitted a draft amendment in january along with a request for a follow on meeting with the agency 
in february  the fda 
table of contents indicated that a meeting was not necessary and suggested that we formally submit the amended application 
we expect to make the formal submission in march we expect that our overall research and development costs for will be slightly increased from levels due to increased spending on the sotr clinical study and potential other initiatives not yet determined 
marketing and sales costs marketing and sales costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  these costs consisted primarily of expenses such as salaries and benefits for the marketing and sales staff  commissions  and related support expenses such as travel  and telephone  totaling  in  compared to  in the decrease in spending in in this category is due primarily to lower commissions and fringe benefit costs  offset in part by additional salaries expense resulting from increased headcount 
the remaining expenses consisted of tradeshows  miscellaneous marketing and outside consultants totaling  in  compared to  in the decrease in this category is due primarily to a decrease in tradeshow and other promotional spending in we expect marketing and sales costs for to increase compared to levels  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in compensation related costs  which in included severance and stock compensation costs related to the departure of an officer  offset in part by the payment of  and accrual of  related to the third amendment to the merger agreement and related documents between us and the former sirius shareholders entered into in april general and administrative expenses are highly dependent on our legal and other professional fees  which can vary significantly from period to period 
we expect general and administrative costs to remain relatively flat in compared with  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of we made a contingent payment to the former shareholders of sirius laboratories in the amount of million and in the same period deemed the resulting goodwill to be impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment  and based on that review  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
the impairment charges were primarily related to our revised estimates of cash flows associated with nicomide and the other sirius products  including the lack of a product pipeline 
settlements  net during the second quarter of  we settled the arbitration proceeding initiated by winston laboratories  inc  for a payment of  and a mutual release and other customary terms 
winston alleged  in october  that we breached the micanol license agreement and micanol transition license agreement 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release relating to litigation with river s edge 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  river s edge made a lump sum payment to us in the amount of  for damages and paid to us for every prescription of its product  nic above  prescriptions that were substituted for nicomide from september  through june  during the years ended december  and the net gain from settlement of the litigation was  and  respectively 
the payments under the settlement agreement ceased in when the parties entered into an amendment to the settlement  which the parties entered into effective as of july  loss gain on change in fair value of warrants the warrants issued to investors in connection with the october  private placement were recorded initially at fair value and are marked to market each reporting period 
the increase decrease in the liability during and was  and  respectively  which resulted in non cash losses gains in the respective periods 
the increases or decreases in fair value of the warrants are primarily due to changes in our stock price and the length of time remaining prior to expiration 
other income  net other income for the year ended december  decreased to  as compared to  in this decrease reflects a decrease in our average investable cash balances during as compared to along with a general decrease in interest rates over the same timeframe 
income taxes there is no provision for income taxes due to ongoing operating losses 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and tax credit carryforwards of approximately  for federal tax purposes 
these amounts expire at various times through we have provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets at december  and the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes that we may utilize to offset our future taxable income  when earned  may be subject to certain limitations  based upon changes in the ownership of our common stock under irc section we currently believe that prior ownership changes have occurred as defined under irc section we currently estimate that our utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes may be limited to an annual limitation between approximately million and million per year 
the final determination of the annual limitation is dependent upon certain technical rules that potentially could reduce the pre change value utilized to calculate the annual limitation 
further  additional rules could result in an enhancement of the aforementioned annual 
table of contents limitation for the first five years after the ownership change 
based on these additional factors  we estimate that we will be able to utilize approximately million to million of our current net operating losses  provided that sufficient income is generated and no further ownership changes were to occur 
the analysis has not been finalized

for the year ended december   kerastick revenues were  representing an increase of  or  over the comparable totals of  kerastick unit sales to end users for the year ended december  were  including  sold in canada and  sold in korea 
this represented an increase from  kerastick units sold in the year ended december   including  sold in canada and  sold in korea 
our average net selling price for the kerastick increased to for the year ended december  from in our average net selling price for the kerastick included sales made directly to our end user customers  as well as sales made to our distributors  in canada  korea and the rest of the world 
the increase in kerastick revenues was driven mainly by increased sales volumes in the united states  due in part to our continued focus on the medical dermatology market  and internationally  through our distribution agreements with stiefel and daewoong  and an increase in our average unit selling price 
for the year ended december   blu u revenues were  essentially flat in comparison with blu u revenues of  the slight decrease in blu u revenues were driven by slightly lower sales volumes which were offset by an increase in our average selling price 
in the year ended december   there were units sold  as compared to units in the total consisted of units sold in the united states and in korea by daewoong

table of contents total non pdt drug product revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the substantial majority of the non pdt drug product revenues were from sales of nicomide and nicomide related royalties 
in april  we were notified by actavis totowa  llc  the manufacturer of nicomide  that actavis would cease manufacturing several prescription vitamins  including nicomide  due to continuing discussions with the fda 
as we had previously disclosed  actavis totowa had received notice that the fda considers prescription dietary supplements to be unapproved new drugs 
in response to this notification and subsequent discussions with the fda  we stopped the sale and distribution of nicomide as a prescription product in june on august   we entered into a worldwide non exclusive patent license agreement to our patent covering nicomide with river s edge pharmaceuticals  llc and an amendment to our settlement agreement with river s edge 
the amendment to the settlement agreement allowed river s edge to manufacture and market a prescription product that could be substitutable for nicomide pursuant to the terms of the license agreement and changed certain payment obligations of river s edge for sales of its substitutable product 
in consideration for granting the license  we were paid a share of the net revenues  as defined in the license agreement  of river s edge s licensed product sales under the license agreement 
nicomide sales in were negatively impacted by residual levels of nic  that were substituted for nicomide  remaining in the distribution channel subsequent to the settlement with river s edge 
the increase in our total revenues in resulted from increased pdt segment revenues in the united states  as well as our pdt product launches in korea and the rest of the world

impairment of goodwill in the third quarter of we made a contingent payment to the former shareholders of sirius laboratories in the amount of million and in the same period deemed the resulting goodwill to be impaired 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment  and based on the review  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
the impairment charges were primarily related to our revised estimate of cash flows associated with nicomide and the other sirius products  including the lack of a product pipeline

recently issued accounting guidance for future adoption in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

asu no 
 which amends existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements and provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon our estimate of the selling price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previous accounting principles required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
this new approach is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june   which for us means no later than january  early adoption is permitted  however  adoption of this guidance as of a date other than january   will require us to apply this guidance retrospectively effective as of january  and will require us to disclose the effect of this guidance as applied to all previously reported interim periods in the fiscal year of adoption 
the potential impact of this standard is being evaluated 
inflation although inflation rates have been comparatively low in recent years  inflation is expected to apply upward pressure on our operating costs 
we have included an inflation factor in our cost estimates 
however  the overall net effect of inflation on our operations is expected to be minimal

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any non us government single issue  issuer or type of investment 

table of contents our investments consist of united states government securities and high grade corporate bonds 
all investments are carried at fair value 
as of december   the weighted average yield to maturity on our investments was 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by  declines in interest rates could  over time  reduce our interest income 
derivative financial instruments the warrants that we issued on october  in connection with the private placement of our common stock were determined to be derivative financial instruments and accounted for as a liability 
these warrants are revalued on a quarterly basis with the change in value reflected in our earnings 
we value these warrants using various assumptions  including the company s stock price as of the end of each reporting period  the historical volatility of the company s stock price  and risk free interest rates commensurate with the remaining contractual term of the warrants 
changes in the company s stock price or in interest rates would result in a change in the value of the warrants and impact the consolidated statement of operations 
a increase in our stock price would cause the fair value of the warrants and our warrant liability to increase by approximately  currency exchange rates the royalties we earn each quarter under our agreement with stiefel laboratories are based on a percentage of the net sales to end users 
these royalties are calculated in local currencies and converted to and paid in united states dollars each reporting period 
under our agreement with daewoong  revenues we earn under the excess purchase price provision of the agreement  if any  are calculated based on end user pricing in local currencies and converted to united states dollars before a determination is made whether any payments are due us 
these payments  if any  are made in united states dollars each reporting period
