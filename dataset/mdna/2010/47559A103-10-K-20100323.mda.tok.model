these risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from forward looking statements 
general the parent company is a bank holding company founded in and headquartered in jeffersonville  new york 
the parent company owns of the outstanding shares of the bank s common stock and derives substantially all of its income from the bank s operations in the form of dividends paid to the parent company 
the bank is a national bank chartered in serving sullivan county  new york with branch offices in jeffersonville  eldred  liberty  loch sheldrake  monticello two  livingston manor  narrowsburg  callicoon  and wurtsboro 
the bank opened a branch in bloomingburg in january and an additional branch is planned to be opened by mid year in white lake 
the bank s administrative offices are located in jeffersonville  new york 
the company s mission is to serve the community banking needs of its borrowers and depositors  who predominantly are individuals  small businesses and local municipal governments 
the company believes it understands its local customer needs and provides quality service with a personal touch 
the financial results of the company are influenced by economic events that affect the communities we serve as well as national economic conditions  primarily interest rates trends  affecting the entire banking industry 
changes in net interest income have the greatest impact on the national economic performance which deteriorated significantly in and continued to be volatile in while government intervention served to stabilize the country s largest financial institutions  uncertainty surrounding employment prospects  real estate activity and consumer spending has muted optimism for near term economic recovery 
regulatory concerns over lingering subprime residential lending problems and increasing commercial real estate defaults make the current banking environment very challenging as bank failures continue to occur at an elevated rate 
real estate values continued to decline in the bank s lending area in retail sales levels decreased by for the full year from to  and small business owners continue to struggle financially as a result 
locally  our economy continues to suffer with higher unemployment  a decline in small businesses  and lower property values 
however  saw the beginning of the construction of interstate highway in sullivan county and the influx of stimulus monies from the american recovery and reinvestment act 
with continued concerns over financial and capital markets  especially the stock market  the bank has seen a large influx of deposits as investors pursued a flight to safety strategy to safeguard their funds 
the bank used a portion of these additional deposits to grow its real estate loan portfolio to help home buyers and businesses in its local communities 
the deposit growth also helped the bank ensure it had sufficient liquidity to weather any unexpected downturns in the economy 
the company has a long history of profitable operations and a strong capital base that have been the foundation of the company since its inception 
management believes this trend will continue and the company will be well positioned to take advantage of business opportunities when the current economic downturn reverses course 
critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and values of real estate particularly in sullivan county 
collateral underlying certain real estate loans could lose value which could lead to future additions to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
foreclosed real estate consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or by acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
these assets are recorded at the lower of fair value of the asset acquired less estimated costs to sell or cost defined as the fair value at initial foreclosure 
at the time of foreclosure  or when foreclosure occurs in substance  the excess  if any  of the loan over the fair market value of the assets received  less estimated selling costs  is charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses and any subsequent valuation write downs are charged to other expense 
operating costs associated with the properties are charged to expense as incurred 
rental income is recognized in non interest income in the period in which it was received 
gains on the sale of foreclosed real estate are included in income when title has passed and the sale has met the minimum down payment requirements prescribed by gaap 
impaired securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation  to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
to determine whether an impairment is other than temporary  management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the impairment  the magnitude and duration of the impairment and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the security 
in addition  the total impairment is separated into the amount of the impairment related to a credit loss and b the amount of the impairment related to all other factors  such as interest rate changes 
the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis of a security is considered to be the credit loss 
once an impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the impairment related to credit loss  if any  is charged to income and the amount of the impairment related to all other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income 
the company has evaluated subsequent events and transactions occurring through the date of issuance of the financial data included herein

within the loan portfolio  commercial real estate increased by million or 
home equity  farmland and construction loans increased million or  million or and million or respectively 
the growth in residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans reflects the company s strategy to conservatively grow the real estate portfolio 
the overall loan portfolio is structured in accordance with management s belief that loans secured by residential and commercial real estate generally result in lower loan loss levels compared to other types of loans because of the value of the underlying collateral 
the company remains committed to maintaining loan credit quality and sacrificing growth in the loan portfolio  if necessary 
there was an  increase in foreclosed real estate at december  to million  up from million at december  the balance in both years consisted primarily of one commercial property 
this commercial property was under a lease agreement  with lease payments being recorded in income 
total nonperforming loans increased million from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to commercial mortgages

this increase was the result of million of net income and an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million partially offset by cash dividends of million 
results of operations versus net income net income for of million increased or  from s net income of million 
the higher earnings level in reflects the interaction of a number of factors 
the most significant factor which increased net income was an increase in other non interest income of million partially offset by an increase in income tax expense and non interest expense of million and million  respectively 
the increase in other non interest income was due primarily to impairment charges of federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc or freddie mac preferred stock in the amount of million partially offset by million in insurance proceeds from bank owned life insurance being recorded in the increase in income tax expense in was due to the loss created by the fhlmc stock and related tax benefit recorded in in addition to the above  net interest income after provision for loan losses decreased  or to million for the year ended december  this decrease was comprised of a decrease in interest and dividend income of million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the same period ended december   and an increase in the provision for loan losses of  to  for the year ended december  a further discussion of the provision follows in the summary of loan loss experience below 
partially offsetting these decreases was a decrease in interest expense of million or from million to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest and dividend income was primarily the result of a  or decrease in loan interest and fees due to lower interest rates despite loan growth  and a net reduction of  or in interest earned on securities 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense on deposits of million or due to the lower interest rate environment 
other interest expense decreased  due to reduced borrowing levels during non interest expense increased million or from million in to million in due to an  or increase in salaries and employee benefits primarily due to retirement benefits and a  or increase in other non interest expense  which is discussed in more detail below 
tax equivalent interest income and interest expense throughout the following discussion  net interest income and its components are expressed on a tax equivalent basis which means that  where appropriate  tax exempt income is shown as if it were earned on a fully taxable basis 
the largest source of income for the company is net interest income  which represents interest earned on loans  securities and short term investments  less interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
tax equivalent net interest income of million for represented an increase of over net interest margin decreased basis points to in compared to in due to reduced interest rates on interest bearing assets combined with a relatively fixed interest rate on long term debt 
total tax equivalent interest income for was million  compared to million in the decrease of million or in is largely the result of a decrease of basis points in the average yield on tax equivalent interest earning assets from in to in despite average loans increasing in all categories for a total of million to million from million in  combined yields decreased basis points from in to in due to new lower yielding loans comprising a greater percentage of total loans 
loan growth in real estate  fixed rate home equity  and time and demand loans amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the average loan yields on those loans decreased basis points  basis points and basis points  respectively 
time and demand loans decreased more than the other categories due to the variable rate feature which is tied to the bank s prime rate 
during  total average tax equivalent securities and average short term investments each increased million with a decrease in yield of basis points and basis points  respectively 
yield on total tax equivalent average securities decreased as higher yielding securities were called or matured and replaced with lower yielding securities 
the yield on average short term investments  which are comprised primarily of federal funds sold  decreased from to 
total interest expense in decreased million to million from million in primarily as a result of a decrease in average rates paid on total interest bearing liabilities from in to in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million from million in to million in  an increase of 
the increase was the result of a million increase in average interest bearing deposits  due to sales initiatives and continuing market uncertainties  partially offset by an million decrease in average federal funds purchased and long term debt 
despite the increase in average interest bearing deposits  the yield decreased basis points due to market conditions and the lower yielding environment 
while average time deposits increased million  interest paid on these deposits decreased  or due to a basis point reduction in interest rates paid to a yield of in average savings and insured money market deposits decreased million or to million for with a basis point or  decrease in interest expense due to lower interest rates 
the yield on average federal funds purchased and other short term debt decreased basis points to from 
the yield on average fixed rate long term debt decreased basis points to due to the maturities of million in debt 
non interest income and non interest expense non interest income primarily consists of service charges  commissions and fees for various banking services  and security gains and losses 
total non interest income of  in was an increase of  over the bulk of this increase was due to an impairment charge on fhlmc preferred stock during of million  partially offset by an insurance benefit on a bank owned life insurance policy of million received in excluding the impairment charge and insurance benefit as discussed above  non interest income increased primarily due to an increase in net gain on the sale of securities of  partially offset by an increase in foreclosed real estate loss of  foreclosed real estate losses increased due to carrying costs associated with an increased level of foreclosed real estate 
service charge income and other non interest income  including merchant atm and interchange fees decreased  or and  or  respectively

non interest expense increased due to an increased fdic assessment of  to  in partially offset by a reduction of  in professional and outside consulting fees  which was primarily due to a deferment of requirements for smaller reporting companies to audit internal controls over financial reporting  and a  reduction in consulting services  a result of the termination of the previously disclosed formal agreement with the bank s regulators

additionally  the effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the million tax exempt insurance benefit 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was  in as compared to  in largely as a result of increased non accrual loan activity in provisions for loan losses are recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  particularly in sullivan county 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
based on management s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio  management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance that management has determined to be necessary to absorb probable incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is established through provisions for losses charged to earnings 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
management evaluates the allowance quarterly using past loan loss experience to establish base allowance pool rates for commercial mortgages  commercial loans  residential loans  consumer and other loans 
these allowance pool rates are then adjusted based on management s current assessment of eight risk factors 
these risk factors are changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices 
changes in national  regional  and local economic and business conditions as well as the condition of various market segments  including the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans 
changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and terms of loans 
changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff 
changes in volume and severity of past due  classified and nonaccrual loans as well as and other loan modifications 
changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system  and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors 
the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations 
the effect of external factors  such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements 
each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving  stable or declining conditions based on management s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation 
adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation 
several specific factors are believed to have more impact on a loan s risk rating  such as those related to national and local economic trends  lending management and staff  volume of past dues and nonaccruals  and concentrations of credit 
therefore  due to the increased risk inherent in criticized and classified loans  the values of these specific factors are increased proportionally 
management believes these increased factors provide adequate coverage for the additional perceived risk 
doubtful loans by definition have inherent losses in which the precise amounts are dependent on likely future events 
these particular loans are reserved at higher pool rates unless specifically reviewed and deemed impaired as described below 
prior to applying the allowance pool rate  commercial mortgages and commercial loans in nonaccrual status or those with loan relationships of  or more are individually considered for impairment 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
loans that are considered individually for impairment and not determined to be impaired are returned to their original pools for allowance purposes 
if a loan is determined to be impaired  it is evaluated under guidelines  which dictate that a creditor shall measure impairment based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the measure of the impaired loan  such as the collateral value  is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific reserve is established in the allowance for loan losses 
residential  consumer and other loans are considered homogenous pools and are not individually considered for impairment 
commercial mortgages and commercial loans with an original principal balance under  for unsecured loans or under  for secured loans are also not individually considered 
instead  the appropriate allowance pool rate is applied to the aggregate balance of these pools 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available  or as later events occur or circumstances change 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
modifications to the methodology used in the allowance for loan losses evaluation may be necessary in the future based on economic and real estate market conditions  new information obtained regarding known problem loans  regulatory guidelines and examinations  the identification of additional problem loans  changes in general accepted accounting principals or other factors 
total nonperforming loans increased million to million at december  from million at december  net loan charge offs increased to  in from  in and gross charge offs increased to  in from  in summary of loan loss experience the following table indicates the amount of charge offs and recoveries in the loan portfolio by category dollars in thousands analysis of the changes in allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year charge offs commercial  financial and agriculture real estate mortgage installment loans other loans total charge offs recoveries commercial  financial and agriculture real estate mortgage installment loans other loans total recoveries net recoveries charge offs provision charged credited to operations balance at end of year ratio of net recoveries charge offs to average outstanding loans the company manages asset quality with a review process which includes ongoing financial analysis of credits and both internal and external loan review of existing outstanding loans and delinquencies 
management strives to identify potential nonperforming loans in a timely basis  take charge offs promptly based on a realistic assessment of probable losses  and maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on the inherent risk of loss in the existing portfolio 
the provision for loan losses was  for the year ended december   up from  for the allowance for loan losses was million at december   million at  and million at the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance s coverage of nonperforming loans was at december  compared to and at december  and  respectively 
despite the continuing high levels of nonperforming loans and the downturn in local economic conditions  the bank is and has been committed to common sense lending practices  sacrificing loan quantity for quality 
this policy is reflected in the banks net charge off recovery history in the above table 
while nonperforming loans have increased  the bank s management believes that loans remain well collateralized 
no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any loan or group of loans  as the entire allowance is available to absorb charge offs in any loan category 
the amount and timing of future charge offs and allowance allocations may vary from current estimates and will depend on local economic conditions 
the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to major portfolio categories and the percentage of each loan category to total loans outstanding 
commercial nonperforming loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
as of december   there were  in loans  compared to  as of december   which were considered to be impaired 
a specific reserve of  has been established to help reduce the risk on these nonperforming loans 
on the remaining loan portfolios  the company applies reserve factors considering historical loan loss data adjusted for current conditions 
distribution of allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands at december  amount of allowance for loan losses residential mortgages commercial mortgages commercial loans installment loans other loans total percent of loans in each category to total loans residential mortgages commercial mortgages commercial loans installment loans other loans includes home equity loans 
nonaccrual and past due loans the company places a loan on nonaccrual status when collectability of principal or interest is doubtful  or when either principal or interest is days or more past due and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied as a reduction of the principal balance when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal 
a distribution of nonaccrual loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest is shown in the following table dollars in thousands 
at december  nonaccrual loan category residential mortgages commercial mortgages commercial loans total nonaccrual loans loans days or more  still accruing interest total nonperforming loans percent of nonperforming loans outstanding to total loans includes home equity loans total nonperforming residential mortgages  commercial mortgages  and commercial loans represent   and of their respective portfolios totals at december   compared to   and at december   respectively 
the majority of the company s total nonaccrual and past due loans are secured loans and  as such  management anticipates there will be limited risk of loss in their ultimate resolution 
nonaccrual loans increased million from million at december  to million at december  except for a specific reserve of  allocated to certain impaired loans  the remaining loan balances are well collateralized with interest being recognized as received 
from time to time  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when the company determines that it will ultimately receive greater economic value under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
candidates for renegotiation must meet specific guidelines 
there were no significant loans that were considered to be troubled debt restructures as of december    or loan portfolio set forth below is selected information concerning the composition of our loan portfolio in dollar amounts and in percentages as of the dates indicated

the following table reflects the maturities of time deposits of  or more in thousands maturity schedule of time deposits of  or more at december  deposits due three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total management anticipates that most of these maturing deposits will rollover at maturity and that liquidity will be adequate to meet funding requirements 
capital adequacy one of management s primary objectives is to maintain a strong capital position to merit the confidence of depositors  the investing public  bank regulators and stockholders 
a strong capital position should help the company withstand unforeseen adverse developments and take advantage of profitable investment opportunities when they arise 
stockholders equity increased million or in following a decrease of in  primarily due to improved accumulated other comprehensive income and net income in the company retained million from net income after the payment of dividends which decreased stockholders equity by million 
in addition  improved accumulated other comprehensive loss increased stockholders equity by million 
in accordance with regulatory capital rules  the adjustment for the after tax net unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale is not considered in the computation of regulatory capital ratios 
under the federal reserve s risk based capital rules at december   the bank s tier i risk based capital was and total risk based capital was of risk weighted assets 
these risk based capital ratios are well above the minimum regulatory requirements of for tier i capital and for total risk based capital 
the bank s leverage ratio tier i capital to average assets of is well above the minimum regulatory requirement

tax exempt securities are affected using a tax rate for fully tax exempt municipals and for dividends 
for the purpose of this schedule  interest on nonaccruing loans has been included only to the extent reflected in the consolidated income statement 
however  the nonaccrual loan balances are included in the average amount outstanding 
computed by dividing tax effected net interest income by total interest earning assets

the company s operating results are affected by inflation to the extent that interest rates  loan demand and deposit levels adjust to inflation and impact net interest income 
management can best counter the effect of inflation over the long term by managing net interest income and controlling expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that the bank s management must continually perform to meet the objectives of maintaining stable net interest income and net interest margin 
therefore  prior to setting the term or interest rate on loans or deposits  or before purchasing investment securities or borrowing funds  management must understand the impact alternative interest rates will have on the bank s interest rate risk profile 
this is accomplished through simulation modeling 
simulation modeling is the process of shocking the current balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios and then measuring the impact of interest rate changes on both projected earning and the economic value of the bank s equity 
the estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loan and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement rates on asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based on available information and current economic and general market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the ultimate accuracy of these assumptions including competitive influences and customer behavior 
accordingly  actual results will differ from those predicted by simulation modeling 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from an instantaneous shift in all market interest rates 
the projected changes in net interest income are totals for the month period beginning january  and ending december  under instantaneous rate shock scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity table dollars in thousands projected change in net projected interest income projected projected dollar percentage as a percent interest rate annualized net change in net change in net of total stock shock prime rate interest income interest income interest income holders equity no change under an instantaneous interest rate shock  interest rates are modeled to change at once 
this is a very conservative modeling technique that illustrates immediate rather than gradual increases or decreases in interest rates 
many assumptions are embedded within our interest rate risk model 
these assumptions are approved by the asset and liability committee and are based upon both management s experience and projections provided by investment securities companies 
assuming our prepayment and other assumptions are accurate and assuming we take reasonable actions to preserve net interest income  we project that net interest income would decline by  or in a instantaneous interest rate shock and increase by  or in a instantaneous interest rate shock 
this is within our asset and liability policy guideline which limits the maximum projected decrease in net interest income in a or instantaneous interest rate shock to of the company s total net interest income 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk is impacted by general market conditions and customer demand 
generally we try to limit the volume and term of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities  so that we can adjust them and pricing of assets and liabilities to mitigate net interest income volatility 
the bank purchases investments for the securities portfolio and borrows from the fhlb of ny to offset interest rate risk taken in the loan portfolio 
the bank also offers adjustable rate loan and deposit products that change as interest rates change 
approximately of the bank s assets at december  were invested in adjustable rate loans and in floating rate investment securities
