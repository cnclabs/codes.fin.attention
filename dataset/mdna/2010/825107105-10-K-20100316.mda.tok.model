the following discussion compares the company s financial condition at december  to its financial condition at december  and the results of operations for the years ended december    and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing in item of part ii of this report 
performance overview the company recorded a decline in net income for when compared to and net income available to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
basic and diluted earnings per common share for was  a decrease of from basic and diluted earnings per common share of for in  basic and diluted earnings per common share was and  respectively

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the most significant accounting policies that the company follows are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has determined that the accounting policy with respect to the allowance for credit losses to be the accounting area that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and  as such  could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
accordingly  the allowance for credit losses is considered to be a critical accounting policy  as discussed below 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the provision for credit losses and risk management section of this discussion 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification became effective on july  at that date  the codification became fasb s officially recognized source of authoritative us generally accepted accounting principles gaap applicable to all public and non public non governmental entities  superseding existing fasb  american institute of certified public accountants aicpa  emerging issues task force eitf and related literature 
rules and interpretive releases of the sec under the authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants 
all other accounting literature is considered non authoritative 
the switch to the codification affects the way companies refer to us gaap in financial statements and accounting policies 
citing particular content in the codification involves specifying the unique numeric path to the content through the topic  subtopic  section and paragraph structure 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies that the company adopted during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of this discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin in  the interest rate environment was less volatile than it was in the previous two years 
during  the frb made no changes to the fed funds rate  unlike during and when the frb reduced the fed funds rate by and basis points  respectively 
the new york prime rate  the primary index used for variable rate loans  also remained unchanged during but declined by basis points during and basis points during these rate changes had a significant impact on our overall yields earned and rates paid 
net interest income remains the most significant component of our earnings 
it is the excess of interest and fees earned on loans  investment securities  and federal funds sold over interest owed on deposits and borrowings 
tax equivalent net interest income for was million  representing a increase over for  higher average balances on earning assets and lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities were sufficient to offset the decline in yields on earning assets 
tax equivalent net interest income for was million  a decrease from during  the increase in the volume of earning assets and lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities were not enough to offset the decrease in yields on earning assets 
the tax equivalent yield on earning assets was for  compared to and for and  respectively 
average earning assets increased to billion during  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the rate paid for interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december   representing a decrease of basis points from the paid for the year ended december  in  the overall rate paid for interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points when compared to the rate paid for the year ended december  the following table sets forth the major components of net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  for the years ended december    and average interest yield average interest yield average interest yield dollars in thousands balance rate balance rate balance rate earning assets loans investment securities taxable tax exempt federal funds sold interest bearing deposits total earning assets cash and due from banks other assets allowance for credit losses total assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits money market and savings deposits certificates of deposit  or more other time deposits interest bearing deposits short term borrowings long term debt total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing deposits other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest spread net interest margin all amounts are reported on a tax equivalent basis computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of for and for and  exclusive of the alternative minimum tax rate and nondeductible interest expense

the tax equivalent yield on loans decreased to for  compared to for and for the million increase in average loans was not enough to offset the decrease of basis points in the yield on loans which was the primary reason for the decline in interest income in the decline in interest income in was due to similar reasons as in a million increase in average loans was not enough to offset the decrease of basis points in the yield on loans

our net interest margin ie  tax equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets represents the net yield on earning assets 
the net interest margin is managed through loan and deposit pricing and asset liability strategies 
the net interest margin was for  compared to for and for the increase in net interest income was not enough to improve the net interest margin in when compared to the lower net interest margin in when compared to was primarily due to decreased yields on earning assets

the increase in other noninterest income in when compared to included a thousand mark to market gain on interest rate swaps and a thousand increase in revenue from the mortgage subsidiary 
the increase in noninterest income in when compared to was primarily related to the acquisition of two insurance entities during the fourth quarter of other service charges and fees increased thousand  approximately half of which was from the new insurance entities  was from the trust division  and the remainder was from banking activities

partially offsetting these increases in expense were lower insurance agency commissions expense of thousand and lower employee benefits expense of thousand 
employee benefits declined from amounts primarily due to less expense accrued for the company s profit sharing plan contribution for the increase in noninterest expense in when compared to was primarily attributable to the operating costs of the two insurance entities acquired during the fourth quarter of these operating costs included salaries  benefits  occupancy  amortization of intangibles  insurance agency commissions and other noninterest expenses

securities sold under agreements to repurchase are issued in conjunction with cash management services for commercial depositors 
we also borrow from the fhlb on a short term basis and occasionally borrow from correspondent banks under federal fund lines of credit arrangements to meet short term liquidity needs 
at december   short term borrowings included million drawn on a million line of credit with a commercial bank 
the company obtained this line of credit during the fourth quarter of the average balance of short term borrowings decreased million  or  in  whereas the balance increased million  or  in the decrease in average short term borrowings in reflected less dependence on short term borrowings for funding growth than was required in also  the need for short term borrowings was reduced due to larger increases in average deposits during than in the following table sets forth our position with respect to short term borrowings

capital management total stockholders equity for the company was million at december   slightly higher than the previous year 
stockholders equity at december  increased over december  the increases in stockholders equity in and were due primarily to earnings for those years  reduced by dividends paid on shares of the common stock of the company 
in addition  during stockholders equity increased million due to the warrant issued to the treasury under the cpp but decreased million as a result of dividends paid on the company s series a preferred stock issued under the cpp 
management plans to retain more from earnings in stockholders equity by reducing dividends in the company reduced the quarterly common stock dividend to from per share  effective for the dividend payable february  the reduction in dividends and resultant increase in capital projected for is intended to support the company s growth and enhance capital ratios 
even though stockholders equity remained relatively flat at the end of when compared to  the company and the banks continued to maintain capital at levels in excess of the risk based capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies

provision for credit losses and risk management originating loans involves a degree of risk that credit losses will occur in varying amounts according to  among other factors  the types of loans being made  the credit worthiness of the borrowers over the term of the loans  the quality of the collateral for the loan  if any  as well as general economic conditions 
the company s board of directors demands accountability of management  keeping the interests of stockholders in focus 
through its asset liability management and audit committee  the board actively reviews critical risk positions  including credit  market  liquidity and operational risk 
the company s goal in managing risk is to reduce earnings volatility  control exposure to unnecessary risk  and ensure appropriate returns for risk assumed 
senior members of management actively manage risk at the product level  supplemented with corporate level oversight through the asset liability management committee and internal audit function 
the risk management structure is designed to identify risk issues through a systematic process  enabling timely and appropriate action to avoid and mitigate risk 
credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to any single industry or customer  collateral protection and standard lending policies and underwriting criteria 
the following discussion provides information and statistics on the overall quality of the company s loan portfolio 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the accounting policies related to nonperforming loans and charge offs and describes the methodologies used to develop the allowance for credit losses  including the specific  formula and nonspecific components 
management believes the policies governing nonperforming loans and charge offs are consistent with regulatory standards 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the resulting provision are reviewed monthly by senior members of management and approved quarterly by the board of directors 
the allowance is increased by provisions for credit losses charged to expense and recoveries of loans previously charged off 
it is decreased by loans charged off in the current period 
provisions for credit losses are made to bring the allowance for credit losses within the range of balances that are considered appropriate based upon the allowance methodology and to reflect losses within the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is determined based upon management s estimate of the inherent risks associated with lending activities  estimated fair value of collateral  past experience and present indicators such as loan delinquency trends  nonaccrual loans and current market conditions 
management believes the allowance is adequate  however  future changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and financial condition of borrowers may result in additions to the allowance 
examination of the portfolio and allowance by various regulatory agencies and consultants engaged by the company may result in the need for additional provisions based upon information available at the time of the examination 
each of the banks maintains a separate allowance for credit losses  which is only available to absorb losses from their respective loan portfolios 
the allowance set by each of the banks is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to its adequacy 
the allowance for credit losses is comprised of three parts the specific allowance  the formula allowance and the nonspecific allowance 
the specific allowance is the portion of the allowance that results from management s evaluation of specific loss allocations for identified problem loans and pooled reserves based on historical loss experience for each loan category 
the formula allowance is determined based on management s assessment of industry trends and economic factors in the markets in which we operate 
the determination of the formula allowance involves a higher risk of uncertainty and considers current risk factors that may not have yet manifested themselves in our historical loss factors 
the nonspecific allowance captures losses that have impacted the portfolio but have yet to be recognized in either the specific or formula allowance 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance to loans identified as impaired 
an impaired loan may show deficiencies in the borrower s overall financial condition  payment history  support available from financial guarantors and or the fair market value of collateral 
when a loan is identified as impaired  a specific allowance is established based on our assessment of the loss that may be associated with the individual loan 
the formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk rated loans  exclusive of those identified as impaired 
loans identified as special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss  as well as impaired  are segregated from performing loans 
remaining loans are then grouped by type commercial real estate and construction  residential real estate  commercial or consumer 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on management s estimate of the risk  complexity and size of individual loans within a particular category 
classified loans are assigned higher allowance factors than non rated loans due to management s concerns regarding collectibility or management s knowledge of particular elements regarding the borrower 
allowance factors grow with the worsening of the internal risk rating 
the nonspecific allowance is used to estimate the loss of non classified loans stemming from more global factors such as delinquencies  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit  the quality of the loan review system and the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements 
as stated elsewhere in this report  the economy has significantly weakened over the past three years 
although the economy of our market area does not appear to be as weak as in other parts of the country  we have experienced weakness in the local real estate market and related construction industry as a result of the widely publicized banking crisis and its impact on the global economy 
these weaknesses in the local economy have resulted in higher provisions for credit losses  loan charge offs and nonperforming assets for us 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  or of average outstanding loans  and of total nonaccrual loans 
this compares to an allowance of million  or of average outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans  at december   and an allowance for credit losses of million  or of outstanding loans and of nonaccrual loans  at december  the ratio of net charge offs to average loans was in  in and in the provision for credit losses was million for  compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the increased provision in reflected the continued overall growth of the loan portfolio  an increase in loan charge offs and nonperforming assets  and a deterioration in overall economic conditions 
net loan charge offs totaled million for  a million increase when compared to million in net charge offs for net charge offs were thousand in the following table sets forth a summary of our loan loss experience for the years ended december dollars in thousands balance  beginning of year loans charged off real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial commercial consumer total recoveries real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial commercial consumer total net loans charged off provision for credit losses balance  end of year average loans outstanding percentage of net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the year percentage of allowance for credit losses at year end to average loans total nonaccrual loans increased to of total loans at december   compared to at december  and at december  specific valuation allowances totaling thousand  thousand and thousand were established to address nonaccrual loans at december   and  respectively 
loans days past due and still accruing were million  million and million at year end  and  respectively 
nonaccrual loans and loans days past due and still accruing at december  were represented primarily by real estate loans 
management believes these loans have been adequately provided for in the allowance for credit losses 
the following table summarizes our nonperforming and past due assets as of december dollars in thousands nonperforming assets nonaccrual loans real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial commercial consumer total nonaccrual loans other real estate and other assets owned total nonperforming assets loans days past due and still accruing real estate construction real estate residential real estate commercial commercial consumer total loans days past due total nonperforming assets and past due loans nonaccrual loans to total loans at period end nonperforming assets and past due loans  to total loans and other real estate and other assets owned during  there was no change in the methods or assumptions affecting the allowance methodology 
the amount of the provision is determined based upon management s analysis of the portfolio  growth and changes in the condition of credits and their resultant specific loss allocations 
historically  we have experienced the majority of our losses in the commercial loan portfolio  which are typically not secured by real estate 
however  during and the company experienced significantly higher losses on real estate secured loans due to declining real estate values and the slowing economy 
as seen in the table below  the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses was thousand at december  and thousand at december  there was no unallocated portion of the allowance at december  at december   and of our total loans were real estate mortgage loans and real estate construction and land development loans  respectively  compared to and at december   and and at december  the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for credit losses and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans for the years ended december of of of of of dollars in thousands amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial consumer unallocated total market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates or equity pricing 
our principal market risk is interest rate risk that arises from our lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
our profitability is largely dependent on the banks net interest income 
interest rate risk can significantly affect net interest income to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice at different intervals than interest earning assets 
the banks asset liability management committees oversee the management of interest rate risk 
the primary purpose of these committees is to manage the exposure of net interest margins to unexpected changes due to interest rate fluctuations 
these efforts affect our loan pricing and deposit rate policies as well as asset mix  volume guidelines  and liquidity and capital planning 
during  the company began using derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives for any trading or other speculative purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on hedging activities 
because we are not exposed to market risk from trading activities and do not utilize off balance sheet management strategies  the asset liability management committees of the banks rely on gap analysis as its primary tool in managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis summarizes the amount of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  which will reprice over various time intervals 
the excess between the volume of assets and liabilities repricing in each interval is the interest sensitivity gap 
positive gap occurs when more assets reprice in a given time interval  while negative gap occurs when more liabilities reprice 
as of december   we had an overall negative gap position within the one year repricing interval because the interest sensitive liabilities exceeded the interest sensitive assets within the one year repricing interval by million  or of total assets 
the negative gap position within the one year interval at december  totaled million  or of total assets 
the million increase in the one year negative gap for when compared to was primarily from the increase in federal funds sold  more than offset by the increase in money market and savings deposits

the model takes into consideration the effect of call features of investment securities as well as prepayments of loans in periods of declining rates 
when actual changes in interest rates occur  the changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may differ from the assumptions used in the model 
the chart below provides the sensitivity profiles for net interest income and the fair value of capital as of year end and as of december  and  due to the low interest rate environment  we believe the results of the minus basis point change in rates is not meaningful

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the banks exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these financial instruments is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments 
the banks use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as they use for on balance sheet instruments 
the banks generally require collateral or other security to support the financial instruments with credit risk 
the amount of collateral or other security is determined based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
the banks evaluate each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the banks to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
letters of credit and other commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
because many of the letters of credit and commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
further information about these arrangements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management does not believe that any of the foregoing arrangements have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity management liquidity describes our ability to meet financial obligations that arise during the normal course of business 
liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived through increased customer deposits  maturities in the investment portfolio  loan repayments and income from earning assets 
to the extent that deposits are not adequate to fund customer loan demand  liquidity needs can be met in the short term funds markets 
we have arrangements with correspondent banks whereby we have million available in federal funds lines of credit and a reverse repurchase agreement available to meet any short term needs which may not otherwise be funded by the banks portfolio of readily marketable investments that can be converted to cash 
the banks are also members of the federal home loan bank  which provides another source of liquidity 
at december   the banks had credit availability of approximately million from the federal home loan bank 
in addition  during the company obtained a million line of credit with a commercial bank 
at december   our loan to deposit ratio was approximately  a more liquid position than the and at year end and  respectively 
during the second quarter of  we began participating in the ind program which increased liquidity 
investment securities available for sale totaling million at the end of were available for the management of liquidity and interest rate risk 
the comparable amounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december   compared to million at year end and million at year end the increase in cash and cash equivalents at the end of compared to the end of was due to a larger amount in federal funds sold 
management is not aware of any demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels 
we have various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments that may require future cash payments 
the purchase obligations in the table below include costs associated with our new core data processing system 
the conversion to the new system occurred in the second quarter of with the new system  we are experiencing automation efficiencies and expecting to achieve future cost savings
