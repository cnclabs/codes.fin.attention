item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a of this report 
none of our acquisitions or dispositions in  or were material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
for information concerning our acquisitions  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
geographic regions and segments our total revenue is almost evenly divided between us and us operations 
for financial information concerning domestic and foreign operations and segment reporting  see our md a and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our clients consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy  our agencies serve similar clients  in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients  across a variety of geographic regions and locations 
our clients participate in virtually all industry sectors of the global economy 
furthermore  in many cases  our agencies or networks serve different product groups within the same clients served by our other agencies or networks 
for example  our largest client was served by more than of our agencies in and represented of our revenue 
no other client accounted for more than of our revenue 
our top clients ranked by revenue were each served  on average  by more than of our agencies in and collectively represented of our revenue 
our employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements 
the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar 
common to all is the ability to understand a client s brand or product  its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand or product to the client s target audience 
recognizing the importance of this core competency  we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency

risk factors global economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations and financial position 
contraction in the global economy led to reductions in advertising  marketing and corporate communications services spending by both our us and international clients and was a significant factor to the year over year decrease in our revenue in the decline was broad based across most industries and geographic areas 
despite recent economic improvement  a future economic downturn and a further reduction in consumer spending could result in further reduction in client spending levels that could adversely affect our business and results of operations and financial position 
renewed turmoil in the credit markets could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
renewed turmoil in the credit markets or a contraction in the availability of credit similar to the conditions experienced beginning in the third quarter of and continuing into would make it more difficult for businesses to meet their capital requirements and could lead clients to change their financial relationship with their vendors  including us 
if that were to occur  we could require additional capital to fund the changes in our day today working capital requirements 
there is no assurance that such additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
additionally  during the recent credit crisis  several banks in the bank syndicate that supports our billion credit facility received capital infusions from their central governments 
in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity  the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment 
as a result  the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us and we could require additional capital 
further  our billion credit facility expires in june we expect to replace this facility with similar financing 
there is no assurance that such financing will be available on comparable terms  if at all 
this could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position 
in a period of severe economic downturn  the risk of a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients could significantly increase 
in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide 
these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
this risk could significantly increase in periods of severe economic downturn 
such a loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
a reduction in client spending and a slowdown in client payments could materially adversely affect our working capital 
working capital is a source of cash as we have historically run a negative working capital cycle during the year 
this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients  including when we place media and incur production costs 
we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations 
the global economic recession has caused and could continue to cause a reduction of the volume of client spending or a delay in the time our clients take to pay us which could negatively affect our working capital 
consequently  we could need to obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on favorable terms  if at all 
such circumstances could therefore materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
companies periodically review and change their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships 
if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients  our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 
the markets in which we participate are highly competitive 
key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop marketing solutions that meet client needs  the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer  and our ability to efficiently serve clients  particularly large international clients  on a broad geographic basis 
while many of our client relationships are long standing  clients put their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time 
we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews 
to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive or retain key clients  our revenue may be adversely affected  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel 
our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may  in some cases  be limited by clients perceptions of  or policies concerning  conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships 
if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests  our business  results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel 
our employees are our most important assets 
our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected  which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we received approximately of our revenue from our largest clients in  and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects  business and results of operations and financial position 
our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time on short notice for any reason 
it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns  or they could reduce future spending 
a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients  or the loss of several of our largest clients  if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients  would adversely affect our revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services  which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
government agencies and consumer groups directly or indirectly affect or attempt to affect the scope  content and manner of presentation of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services  through regulation or other governmental action 
any such limitation on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices 
such claims by businesses or governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position in the future 
government or legislative action may limit the tax deductibility of advertising expenditures by certain industries or for certain products and services 
these actions would cause our clients affected by such actions to reduce their spending on our services which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad  including political instability and foreign exchange controls  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses 
the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions  competition for client assignments and talented staff  new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations 
there are risks of doing business abroad  including those of political instability and foreign exchange controls  which do not affect domestic focused firms 
these risks could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial position 
for financial information on our operations by geographic area  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 
we conduct business in numerous developing countries around the world 
the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices  nationalization  social  political and economic instability and currency repatriation restrictions  among other risks 
in addition  commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague  inconsistently administered and retroactively applied 
if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business  our prospects  business  financial position and results of operations in those countries could be harmed  which could then have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to million  in whole or in part  at specified dates in the future 
in june  our notes and notes aggregating million may be put back to us for repurchase and in july  million of our notes may be put back to us for repurchase 
if we are required to satisfy one or more puts to repurchase our convertible notes  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the puts 
we also believe that we will still have capacity under our existing credit commitments sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after any put event 
however  in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were to decrease  we might need to seek additional funding alternatives 
there is no assurance that such additional financing would be available on comparable terms  if at all 
downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 
standard and poor s rating service currently rates our long term debt a  moody s investors service rates our long term debt baa and fitch ratings rates our long term debt a 
our short term debt ratings are a  p and f by the respective agencies 
our outstanding senior notes  convertible notes and existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade 
the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility  however  would increase if our long term debt credit rating is downgraded 
additionally  our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short or long term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies 
furthermore  the notes  notes and notes are convertible at specified ratios if  in the case of the notes  our long term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard poor s ratings service  or baa or lower by moody s investors service or in the case of the notes and notes to bbb or lower by s p  and ba or lower by moody s 
these events would not  however  result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 
we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 
we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses we believe may be complementary to our businesses and client needs 
as part of the review we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction 
despite our efforts  we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks 
as a result  we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition 
if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
goodwill may become impaired 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap or gaap  we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements resulting from our acquisition activities  which principally represents the specialized know how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired 
we test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment  at least annually at the end of the second quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows 
while we have concluded  for each year presented in our financial statements included in this report  that our goodwill is not impaired  future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired 
any resulting non cash impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
we could be affected by future laws or regulations enacted in response to climate change concerns and other actions 
although our companies may not be directly affected by current cap and trade laws and current requirements to reduce emissions  we could be in the future 
however  we could also be affected indirectly by increased prices for goods or services provided to us by companies that are directly affected by these laws and regulations and pass their increased costs through to their customers 
additionally  to comply with potential future changes in environmental laws and regulations  we may need to incur additional costs 
at this time  we cannot estimate what impact such costs may have on our results of operations and financial position

item legal proceedings beginning on june   several putative class actions were filed against us and certain senior executives in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the actions have since been consolidated under the caption in re omnicom group inc securities litigation  no 
cv rcc  on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of our common stock between february  and june  the consolidated complaint alleges  among other things  that our public filings and other public statements during that period contained false and misleading statements or omitted to state material information relating to our calculation of the organic growth component of period to period revenue growth  our valuation of and accounting for certain internet investments made by our communicade group communicade  which we contributed to seneca investments llc seneca in  and the existence and amount of certain contingent future obligations in respect of acquisitions 
the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages plus costs and attorneys fees 
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and on march   the court dismissed portions and of the complaint detailed above 
the court s decision denying the defendants motion to dismiss the remainder of the complaint did not address the ultimate merits of the case  but only the sufficiency of the pleading 
defendants have answered the complaint 
discovery concluded in the second quarter of on april   the court granted plaintiff s motion for class certification  certifying the class proposed by plaintiffs 
in the third quarter of defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on plaintiff s remaining claim 
on january   the court granted defendants motion in its entirety  dismissing all claims and directing the court to close the case 
on february   the plaintiffs filed a notice of intent to appeal that decision to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
the appeal has been fully briefed and oral argument before the court of appeals occurred on may  the defendants continue to believe that the allegations against them are baseless and intend to vigorously oppose plaintiff s appeal 
currently  we are unable to determine the outcome of this appeal and the effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the outcome of this matter is inherently uncertain and may be affected by future events 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate effect of this matter 
we are also involved from time to time in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
we do not presently expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary we are a strategic holding company  providing professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world 
on a global  pan regional and local basis  our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
our business model was built and continues to evolve around our clients 
while our agencies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines  we organize our services around our clients 
the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients specific requirements should be the central focus in how we structure our business offerings and allocate our resources 
this client centric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client s specific marketing requirements 
we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our client centric approach  as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients 
in addition  we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong  entrepreneurial management teams that typically either currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 
as one of the world s leading advertising  marketing and corporate communications companies  we operate in all major markets of the global economy 
we have a large and diverse client base 
our largest client represented of our revenue for the year ended december  and no other client accounted for more than of our revenue 
our top clients accounted for of our revenue 
our business is spread across a significant number of industry sectors with no one industry comprising more than of our revenue from our  largest clients 
although our revenue is generally balanced between the us and international markets and we have a large and diverse client base  we are not immune to general economic downturns 
during the year  a difficult global economy and declining consumer spending and rising unemployment in most major markets and other factors led clients to reduce spending on the services that our agencies provide and therefore negatively impacted our revenue and our results of operations for in addition  the weakening of most major currencies against the us dollar commencing late in the third quarter of contributed to a reduction in our revenue through the third quarter of however  beginning late in the third quarter of  most major currencies strengthened against the us dollar  resulting in an increase in our revenue as a result of foreign exchange impacts of approximately in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the decline in our revenue was broad based across most industries and geographic areas 
during previous periods of economic downturn  our industry experienced slower growth rates and industry wide margin contractions 
while business prospects in our industry have stabilized  continued economic uncertainty and reductions in consumer spending may result in further reductions in client spending levels that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
we have and will continue to closely monitor economic conditions  client spending and other factors  and in response  have taken and will take actions available to us to reduce costs and manage working capital 
in the current economic environment  there can be no assurance as to the effects of future economic conditions  client spending patterns  client credit worthiness and other developments on us and whether and to what extent our efforts to respond to them will be effective 
certain business trends have had a positive impact on our business and industry 
these trends include our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan regional and global markets and integrating traditional and non traditional marketing channels  as well as utilizing interactive technologies and new media outlets 
additionally  in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their total marketing budgets  clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers 
we believe these trends have benefitted our business in the past and  over the medium and long term  will continue to provide a competitive advantage to us 
given our size and breadth  we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators 
the key indicators that we review are revenue and operating expenses 
we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth  including growth by major geographic location  growth by major marketing discipline  growth from currency fluctuations  growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients 
in recent years  our revenue has been divided almost evenly between domestic and international operations 
in  our revenue declined  of which was related to changes in foreign exchange rates  was related to the acquisition of entities  net of entities disposed and  was a decrease in organic growth 
almost one third of the decline in revenue in that is unrelated to foreign exchange rates and acquisitions net of dispositions  was driven by reduced spending by our auto industry clients and another third from reduced spending by our clients on events and promotions and on advertising for recruitment 
the remainder of the decline in was the result of an overall reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our clients 
the total decline in revenue in compared to  in our four fundamental disciplines was as follows traditional media advertising   crm   public relations   and specialty communications  
we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories salary and service costs  and office and general expenses 
salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs 
office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs  technology related costs and depreciation and amortization 
each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is similar across our disciplines 
at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client s brand and its selling proposition  and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client s target audience 
the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines  and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
because we are a service business  we monitor salary and service costs and office and general costs as a percentage of revenue 
salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue 
however  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to in compared to in  principally due to the year over year increase of million in severance costs that included severance costs recorded in the fourth quarter of of million related to the loss in the quarter of a client in the automotive sector 
this reflects the actions we took to reduce our workforce and contain compensation related costs in the face of reduced client spending 
office and general expenses not directly related to servicing clients are less directly linked to changes in our revenue than salary and service costs 
as a result  office and general expenses increased to of revenue in compared to in net income omnicom group inc in decreased million or to million from  million in the period over period decrease in net income omnicom group inc is principally due to the factors described above  as well as the increase in pre tax net interest expense for of million 
diluted net income per common share omnicom group inc decreased to in  as compared to in the prior year period 
critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements critical accounting policies we have prepared the following summary of our critical accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related discussion in this md a 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes  including our discussion in note setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail  for a more complete understanding of critical accounting policies discussed below 
estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets  accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period 
a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other and when evaluating cost method investments that consist of ownership interests in non public companies  to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
acquisitions and goodwill we have historically made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions 
in making acquisitions  the price we pay is based on an evaluation of various factors  including specialized know how  reputation  competitive position  geographic coverage and service offerings  as well as our experience and judgment 
on january   we adopted revisions to us gaap included in codification topic  business combinations 
these revisions require  among other things that the acquirer record of the goodwill acquired and the associated noncontrolling interest when less than of the target is acquired  that all transaction costs are expensed as incurred and that a liability for contingent purchase price obligations earn outs  if any  is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date and is remeasured at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recorded in our results of operations 
during  we completed four acquisitions of new subsidiaries and made additional investments in companies in which we had an existing minority ownership interest 
total additions to goodwill for these transactions was million 
in addition  we made or accrued contingent purchase price payments of million  which were included in goodwill 
a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations is set forth in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
the amount of contingent purchase price obligations is based on future performance 
contingent purchase price obligations  for acquisitions completed prior to january  are accrued  in accordance with us gaap  when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 
our acquisition strategy has been focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach and or their service capabilities to better serve our clients 
additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know how of the acquisition targets 
accordingly  like most service businesses  a substantial portion of the intangible asset value that we acquire is the know how of the people  which is treated as part of goodwill and  is not valued separately 
for each of our acquisitions  we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such identified assets 
the majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets that we acquire is derived from customer relationships  including the related customer contracts 
when making the necessary assumptions in valuing these identified intangible assets  we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 
the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually at the end of the second quarter of the year 
we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments  which are our five agency networks 
the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region 
they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions 
we then concluded that for each of our operating segments  their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level 
our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in the codification 
consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy  the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients 
in addition  the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics  as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services  the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy  and the provision of technology requirements which are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
finally  the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
estimates and assumptions goodwill impairment review we use the following valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units  including the income approach which utilizes discounted expected future cash flows  comparative market participant multiples for ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and when available  consideration of recent and similar purchase acquisition transactions 
in the latter part of  contraction in the global economy  a decline in consumer spending  rising unemployment and other factors accelerated the global recession 
the global recession reduced clients spending on the services that our agencies provide 
as a result  our revenue and profit declined in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the prior year 
a significant adverse change in business conditions typically triggers an evaluation of goodwill for impairment prior to the required annual review 
although the decline we experienced in our business on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter was not significant  given the generally negative economic environment  we updated our impairment analyses for each of our reporting units as of december  and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
in applying the income approach  we use estimates to derive the expected discounted cash flows dcf for each reporting unit  which serve as the basis of our valuation 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth and operating margin  tax rates  capital expenditures  weighted average cost of capital and related discount rates and expected long term cash flow growth rates 
all these estimates and assumptions are affected by conditions specific to our businesses  economic conditions related to the industry in which we operate  as well as  conditions in the global economy 
the assumptions which have the most significant affect on our valuations derived using a dcf methodology are the expected long term growth rate of our reporting units cash flows and the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the range of assumptions used for the long term growth rate and wacc in our evaluation as of june  and december  are as follows june  december  long term growth rate wacc long term growth rates represent the expected long term growth rate for the industry in which we operate and the global economy 
the average historical revenue growth rate of our reporting units for the past eight years was approximately and the average nominal gdp growth of the countries comprising our major markets which account for substantially all of our revenue average nominal gdp was over the same period 
we considered this history when determining the long term growth rates to be used in both our interim impairment test at december  and in our annual impairment test at june  we believe marketing expenditures over the long term have a high correlation to gdp 
we also believe  based on our historical performance  that our long term growth rate will exceed average nominal gdp growth 
the risk adjusted discount rate used in our dcf analysis represents the estimated wacc for each of our reporting units 
the wacc is comprised of a risk free rate of return  a business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market  an equity risk premium that is based on the rate of return on equity of publicly traded companies with business characteristics comparable to our reporting units  and the current after tax market rate of return on debt of companies with business characteristics similar to our reporting units  each weighted by the relative market value percentages of our equity and debt 
although the risk free rate of return increased during the first half of  several other components of our wacc decreased during the first half of these decreases  which more than offset the increase in the risk free rate and caused our overall assumed wacc to decline  were comprised of a decrease in the business risk index ascribed to us and to companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units  a systemic decrease in the risk premium on equity securities  and a decrease in the cost of corporate debt in the marketplace 
the business risk index is based on a market derived variable that measures the volatility of the share price of equity securities relative to the volatility of the overall equity market 
the index for the companies in our industry comparable to our reporting units  as well as the index assigned to us  has been trending downward  except for a significant increase in the index late in the general decrease in risk premiums on equity securities compared to year end is a result of the gradual return of investors to the equity markets in the first half of the decrease in the cost of corporate debt is a result of the narrowing of credit spreads on corporate debt that was attributable to the overall improvement in the capital markets in the first half of relative to the latter part of additionally  when performing our interim impairment test as of december  and estimating the future cash flows of all of our reporting units  we considered the changes in the economic environment that occurred in late as well as the economic outlook in early we experienced a reduction in our revenue in the fourth quarter of of and had less visibility than we historically have had at that time regarding near term client spending plans 
this led us to estimate  for purposes of performing our interim impairment test  a reduction in our revenue and cash flows for compared to  for all of our reporting units and zero growth from those reduced levels for for all of our reporting units 
for the purposes of performing our interim impairment test  we estimated that growth would return in at levels below our historical growth rates for an interim four year period 
when performing our annual impairment test as of june  and estimating the future cash flows of all of our reporting units  we also considered the changes in the economic environment that occurred in late as well as the economic outlook in mid year although we experienced a reduction in our revenue in the first half of of  of which was due to foreign exchange movements  our visibility regarding near term client spending plans improved compared to the fourth quarter of this led us to estimate for an interim five year period  for purposes of performing our annual impairment test  a large reduction in our revenues and cash flows for the second half of compared to  for all of our reporting units and growth from those reduced levels for for all of our reporting units  with growth slowly increasing in subsequent years  but at levels well below our historical growth rates 
for both our interim test as of december  and our annual test as of june   beginning in and  respectively  we used an estimated long term growth rate of for all of our reporting units 
sensitivity analysis and conclusion goodwill impairment review consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy  the agencies within our reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients 
in addition  the agencies within our reporting units have similar economic characteristics  as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services  the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy  and the provision of technology requirements that are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
our reporting units do vary in size with respect to revenue and the amount of debt allocated to them 
these differences drive the variations in fair value among our reporting units 
in addition  these differences as well as differences in book value  including goodwill  cause the variations in the amount by which fair value exceeds book value among the reporting units 
the reporting unit goodwill balances and debt vary by reporting unit primarily because our three legacy agency networks were acquired at the formation of omnicom and were accounted for as a pooling of interest that did not result in any additional debt or goodwill being recorded 
the remaining two agency networks  including reporting unit  were built through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase transactions and as a result  they have a relatively higher amount of goodwill and debt 
the decline in the fair value of our reporting units that would need to occur in order to fail step one of our goodwill impairment test the threshold is as follows dollars in millions june  december  reporting units goodwill threshold goodwill threshold at december   reporting unit had the highest total revenue  operating profit and enterprise value of our five reporting units  and its fair value net of debt approximated the average of the total fair value of all of our reporting units 
however  because it had the highest book value and debt relative to the other reporting units  it had the lowest threshold as of december  the long term growth rate needed to achieve our future cash flow projections for reporting unit to avoid failing step one of our december  interim goodwill impairment test and thus potentially having a goodwill impairment charge was approximately 
this growth rate would represent a reduction in the long term growth rate of that we used in performing our interim impairment test at december  we concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective book values and therefore  our goodwill was not impaired at december   the date of our interim impairment test 
based on the analysis described above  we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired as of june   because the fair values of each of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective net book values 
notwithstanding our belief that the assumptions we used in our impairment testing for our wacc and long term growth rate are reasonable  we performed a sensitivity analysis for each of our reporting units 
the results of this sensitivity analysis for our annual impairment test as of june  revealed that if our wacc was increased by  and or our long term growth rate was decreased by  the fair value of each of our reporting units would continue to be substantially in excess of their respective net book values and pass step one of the impairment test 
we plan to continue to perform our impairment test at the end of the second quarter of each year unless certain events or circumstances trigger the need for an interim evaluation for impairment 
the estimates we use in testing our goodwill for impairment do not constitute forecasts or projections of future results of operations  but rather are estimates and assumptions based on historical results and assessments of macroeconomic factors affecting our reporting units 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  but they are subject to change from period to period 
actual results of operations and other factors will likely differ from the estimates used in our discounted cash flow valuation and it is possible that differences could be material 
a change in the estimates we use could result in a decline in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units from the amounts derived as of our latest valuation and could cause us to fail step one of our goodwill impairment test if the estimated fair value for the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  including its goodwill 
a large decline in estimated fair value of a reporting unit could result in a non cash impairment charge and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
subsequent to our annual evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill at the end of the second quarter of  there were no events or circumstances that triggered the need for an interim evaluation for impairment 
in addition  our actual results for revenue growth and cash flows for have approximated the assumptions used in our testing as of june  further  those assumptions for revenue growth and cash flows for all reporting units for are less than or equal to our most current forecast for revenue growth and cash flows as of december  in addition  the comparable market participant multiples of ebitda we used in our june  valuation have improved as of december  based on these factors  we did not perform an interim impairment evaluation on the carrying value of our goodwill at december  additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with codification topic  revenue recognition and applicable sec staff accounting bulletins 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour  or equivalent basis  and revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement  upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured 
we record revenue net of sales tax  use tax and value added tax 
certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements 
these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
more specifically  our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery  performance and acceptance must be in accordance with the client arrangement  and collection is reasonably assured 
because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways  all of the key elements set forth above apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 
in the majority of our businesses  we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained  when the fee or commission is earned 
although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities  the arrangements with our clients are such that we act as an agent on their behalf 
in these cases  costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue 
in accordance with certain arrangements  we act as principal and we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and third party production costs and are responsible for payment 
in connection with these arrangements  revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed since revenue has been earned for the sale of goods or services 
a small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals 
we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved  or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients 
additional information about our revenue recognition appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
employee share based compensation a fair value approach is used in determining the award value of share based employee compensation in accordance with codification topic  compensation stock compensation 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of option awards 
this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life  rate of risk free interest  volatility and dividend yield 
if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value  our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 
additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note to our consolidated financial statements

fourth quarter in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net gain of million related to transactions with affiliated companies 
the net gain was comprised of a million gain resulting from the remeasurement to fair value  in accordance with codification topic  of our existing ownership interest in an affiliated company in which we acquired a majority stake in december and was partially offset by impairment charges of million principally related to the loss on the sale of an investment in an affiliated company in january also in the fourth quarter of  we took a charge of million in connection with the loss in the quarter of a significant client in the automotive sector  primarily for severance and lease termination costs 
salary and service costs for reflect an increase in severance costs of million related to the client loss 
office and general expenses for reflect a decrease of million related to the remeasurement gain of million  offset by lease termination costs of million related to the client loss and the impairment charges of million on investments in affiliated companies

the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency in this case  million less  million for the total column in the table for the year 
the acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses 
netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period 
the organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth 
the percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component in this case  million for the total column in the table for the year 
the components of revenue and revenue change for the full year in our primary geographic markets are summarized and discussed below dollars in millions compared to revenue change united states  euro markets  united kingdom  other  total  for the full year  foreign exchange impacts decreased our revenue by million 
beginning late in the third quarter of and continuing through the third quarter of  the us dollar strengthened against most other major currencies  such as the british pound  euro  canadian dollar  brazilian real and australian dollar 
for the fourth quarter of  foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by million 
the most significant impacts resulted from the weakening of the us dollar against the british pound  euro  brazilian real  australian dollar  and korean won 
assuming exchange rates at february  remain unchanged  we expect foreign exchange impacts to increase our full year revenue by less than 
additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients  we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four disciplines as summarized below traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
year ended december  dollars in millions vs revenue of revenue revenue of revenue change change traditional media advertising   crm   public relations   specialty communications   operating expenses our operating expenses decreased  million  or  to  million from  million in  as shown below

salary and service costs decreased  million in compared to this reflects actions we took to reduce our workforce and contain compensation related costs in the face of reduced client spending 
salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly to in compared to in  principally due to the year over year increase in severance costs of million that included severance costs recorded in the fourth quarter of million related to the loss in the quarter of a client in the automotive sector 
office and general expenses represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
office and general expenses as a percentage of revenue increased in compared to these costs were comprised of office and equipment rents  technology costs and depreciation  amortization of identifiable intangible assets  professional fees and other overhead expenses  and were less directly linked to changes in our revenue 
excluding the net impact of the remeasurement gain  lease termination costs and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of totaling million  office and general expenses decreased million in compared to this decrease was primarily a result of our cost containment activities 
net interest expense our net interest expense increased to million in  as compared to million in our gross interest expense decreased by million to million 
the decrease in gross interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower borrowings under our credit facility and commercial paper issuances that substantially offset the increased interest resulting from our senior notes issued on july  our gross interest income decreased million to million in this decrease was attributable to lower investment rates and foreign exchange impacts on the interest earned on our foreign cash balances 
see liquidity and capital resources and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of our indebtedness and related matters 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was  which is slightly higher than our rate of 
the increase in our effective tax rate was caused by higher foreign taxes  including a tax expense incurred in of million due to the resolution of an uncertain tax position for a foreign subsidiary 
this was substantially offset by a reduction in income tax expense in of million from the recognition of foreign income tax credits 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law 
the arra provides an election where qualifying cancellation of indebtedness income can be deferred and included in taxable income ratably over the five taxable years beginning in and ending in during the first quarter of  we retired million of our notes 
the retirement of the notes resulted in a tax liability of approximately million 
during the third quarter of  we retired million of our notes 
the retirement of the notes resulted in a tax liability of approximately million 
in the first quarter of  million of our notes were put back to us for purchase at par and million of the notes were repurchased and retired 
a partnership that we controlled purchased the remaining million of the notes that were put 
during the fourth quarter of  the partnership was liquidated and the million of our notes held by the partnership were permanently retired 
the retirement of these notes resulted in a tax liability of approximately million 
these liabilities  which were previously recorded  are included in our balance sheet in our deferred tax liabilities

in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients  we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four disciplines as summarized below traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
year ended december  dollars in millions vs revenue of revenue revenue of revenue growth growth traditional media advertising   crm   public relations   specialty communications   operating expenses our operating expenses increased million  or  to  million from  million in  as shown below 
year ended december  dollars in millions vs of revenue of total operating expenses of revenue of total operating expenses growth growth revenue   operating expenses salary and service costs  office and general expenses   total operating expenses   operating income   because we provide professional services  salary and service costs represent the largest part of our operating expenses 
as a percentage of total operating expenses  salary and service costs were in and in these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs 
salary and service costs accounted for million of the million increase in total operating expenses 
during the first nine months of  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased slightly compared to the same period in however  given the reduction of revenue that occurred in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  we took actions to reduce incentive compensation and our discretionary spending 
as a result of taking these actions the ratio of salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue for the full year would have been similar to that of  however  we reduced our work force in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of reductions in client spending in and we incurred expenses related to severance benefits that were million greater than similar costs incurred in the fourth quarter of as a result of these incremental severance costs  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased to for the full year of compared to in office and general expenses represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents  technology costs and depreciation  amortization of identifiable intangible assets  professional fees and other overhead expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  office and general expenses decreased marginally in from to 
these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs 
although they tend to increase as our revenues increase  the rate of increase could be more or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 
net interest expense our net interest expense increased slightly by million in to million  as compared to million in our gross interest expense increased by million to million 
the increase was primarily due to higher interest expense on our euro and yen denominated swaps  which were terminated in the second half of  and additional interest expense due to an increase in our average debt outstanding  partially offset by interest expense savings in associated with a decrease in the amortization of supplemental interest payments that were made on our zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due and notes and notes in prior periods 
the total increase in gross interest expense was almost entirely offset by increased interest income earned on our foreign cash balances 
in february  we borrowed million under our credit facility to fund the purchase of our notes by us and a partnership we controlled 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either a floating base rate or the eurocurrency rate  plus an applicable margin 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was  which was down slightly from our rate of  primarily due to lower rates in various foreign jurisdictions 
income per common share omnicom group inc for the foregoing reasons  our net income omnicom group inc in increased million  or  to  million from million in diluted earnings per share omnicom group inc increased to in  as compared to in the prior year for the reasons described above  as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year 
the reduction in our weighted average common shares outstanding was the result of our purchases throughout and the first eight months of of treasury shares  net of shares issued upon option exercises and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
liquidity and capital resources cash sources and requirements  including contractual obligations historically  substantially all of our non discretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
our principal non discretionary funding requirement is our working capital 
in addition  as discussed below  we have contractual obligations related to our senior notes and convertible notes  our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations  as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years 
our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders  payments for new strategic acquisitions  capital expenditures and repurchases of our common stock 
our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow  cash on hand and short term investments 
in addition  in any given year  depending on the level of discretionary activity  we may use other sources of available funding  such as the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under our credit facility to finance these activities 
we have a seasonal working capital cycle 
working capital requirements are lowest at year end 
the fluctuation in working capital requirements between the lowest and highest points during the course of the year can be more than billion 
this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients  including when we place media and incur production costs 
we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations 
during the year  we manage liquidity through our credit facilities  as discussed below under cash management 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by million from december  the components of the increase in are summarized below dollars in millions sources cash flow from operations  exclude change in net working capital principal cash sources  uses capital expenditures dividends paid acquisition payments  including contingent acquisition obligations of  net of cash acquired purchase of treasury shares of  net of proceeds from stock option exercises and stock sold in our employee stock purchase plan of principal discretionary cash uses principal cash sources in excess of discretionary cash uses exchange rate changes other  principally financing activities add back change in net working capital increase in cash and cash equivalents the principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses amounts presented above are non gaap financial measures 
these amounts exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities  including commercial paper issuances and redemptions  and borrowings under our credit facility used to fund these working capital changes 
this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information presented in compliance with us gaap 
non gaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 
additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 
cash management we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through our wholly owned finance subsidiaries that manage our treasury centers in north america  europe and asia 
each day  operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center 
likewise  operations that require funding borrow funds from their regional treasury center 
the treasury centers then aggregate the net position 
the net position is either invested with or borrowed from third party providers 
to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity  they have the ability to access local currency lines of credit  our billion credit facility  or depending on market conditions at the time  issue up to billion of us dollar denominated commercial paper 
this enables us to more efficiently manage our debt balances and efficiently utilize our cash  as well as better manage our exposure to foreign exchange 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by million and our short term investments decreased by million from the prior year 
short term investments include investments of our excess cash which we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle  generally within one year 
the majority of our short term investments represent time deposits that mature in we consider the unrepatriated cumulative earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the united states 
in managing our day to day liquidity and our long term capital structure  we do not rely on the unrepatriated earnings as a source of funds 
we have not provided for us federal and state income taxes on these undistributed foreign earnings 
determination of the amount of this tax liability is based on the rate differential of the us income taxes in excess of the foreign taxes on any remittances of the undistributed earnings and is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation 
changes in tax rules may affect our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
in may  several proposals to revise us federal tax laws were announced  including a proposal to reduce or eliminate the deferral of us income tax on our unrepatriated earnings  to defer tax deductions allocable to non us earnings until such earnings are repatriated  and to change the calculation of the us foreign tax credit 
it is unclear whether these proposed tax changes will be enacted  or if enacted  what the scope of the changes will be 
depending on their content  such changes could negatively affect our results of operations and financial position 
we manage our net debt position  which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and short term investments  centrally through our treasury centers as discussed above 
our net debt outstanding at december  decreased by  million as compared to the prior year end  as summarized below dollars in millions debt short term borrowings due less than one year commercial paper issued under billion credit facility due june  senior notes due april  senior notes due july  convertible notes due february  convertible notes due july  convertible notes due june  convertible notes due july  other debt total debt   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  net debt  net debt is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe this presentation  together with the comparable us gaap measure  is meaningful for understanding our liquidity and it reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management 
non gaap financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  financial information presented in compliance with us gaap 
non gaap financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants we maintain a credit facility with a consortium of banks providing borrowing capacity of up to billion as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our credit facility provides back up liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us  as well as support for our commercial paper issuances 
depending on market conditions at the time  we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper  borrowing under our short term uncommitted lines of credit  or borrowing on our credit facility 
during  we issued and redeemed billion of commercial paper and we borrowed and repaid billion under the credit facility 
the average term of the commercial paper was days and the average borrowing under the credit facility was days 
at december   we had no commercial paper or borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
at december   we had short term borrowings of million outstanding  which are comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries 
these bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries bank agreements 
our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreements 
these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda under our credit agreement  ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to no more than times 
in addition  we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least times 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants  as our ratio of debt to ebitda was times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was times 
in addition  our credit facility does not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 
standard and poor s rating service currently rates our long term debt a  moody s investors service rates our long term debt baa and fitch ratings rates our long term debt a 
our short term debt credit ratings are a  p and f by the respective agencies 
our outstanding senior notes  senior notes  convertible notes and bank credit facilities do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded 
the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facilities  however  will increase if our long term debt credit rating is lowered 
our wholly owned finance subsidiaries omnicom capital inc oci and omnicom finance inc ofi provide funding for our operations by incurring debt and lending the proceeds to our operating subsidiaries 
oci and ofi s assets consist of intercompany loans made to our operating subsidiaries and the related interest receivable 
oci and ofi are co issuers and co obligors of our senior notes  senior notes and convertible notes 
there are no restrictions in the applicable indentures on the ability of oci  ofi or us to obtain funds from our subsidiaries through dividends  loans or advances 
the senior notes  senior notes and convertible notes are a joint and several liability of us  oci and ofi  and we unconditionally guarantee the obligations of oci and ofi with respect to the senior notes  senior notes and convertible notes 
on july   we issued million principal amount of senior notes due july  the proceeds from the issuance before deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses were million 
the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co issuers 
at december   we had a total of million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding  consisting of million notes  million notes and million of the notes and the notes combined 
the holders of our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in august of each year 
the holders of our notes and our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on june     and on each june annually thereafter through june  the  and notes are convertible  at specified ratios  only upon the occurrence of certain events  including if our common shares trade above certain levels  if we effect extraordinary transactions or  in the case of the notes  if our long term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard poor s ratings service  or baa or lower by moody s investors service or in the case of the and notes to bbb or lower by s p  and ba or lower by moody s 
these events would not  however  result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 
for additional information about the terms of these notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  we did not pay a supplemental interest payment to noteholders of our notes 
additionally  none of the notes were put back to us for repayment 
in july  we did not pay a supplemental interest payment to noteholders of our notes 
additionally  none of the notes were put back to us for repayment 
in february  we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of per  principal amount of notes to holders of our notes as of february  who did not put their notes back to us 
none of the notes were put back to us and on february  noteholders were paid a total supplemental interest payment of million that was amortized ratably over a month period to february in june  we did not pay a supplemental interest payment to noteholders of our notes and notes  and none of our notes or notes were put back to us for repurchase 
in july  we offered to pay a supplemental interest payment of per  principal amount of notes to holders of our notes as of july  and we amended the notes to eliminate omnicom s right to redeem the notes prior to august   provided that the noteholders delivered a valid consent to the amendment  waived their rights to contingent cash interest payable from october  through and including august   and agreed not to put their notes back to us 
substantially all of the noteholders consented to the amendments and all of the notes remained outstanding 
noteholders were paid a total supplemental interest payment totaling million that was amortized ratably over a twelve month the period to july on february   we paid a supplemental interest payment of per  principal amount of notes to holders of our notes 
approximately million of our notes were retired and a partnership that financed the purchase of million of our notes on our behalf was paid a supplemental interest payment of million and the other noteholders who did not put their notes were paid a supplemental interest payment of million 
the loan made to the partnership bore interest at per annum 
on consolidation  interest income from the loan to the partnership partly offsets interest expense from the amortization of the supplemental interest payment made to the partnership resulting in net interest expense of million for the year ended december  in december  the partnership was liquidated and the remaining million of our notes held by the partnership were permanently retired 
on august   we paid a supplemental interest payment of million to holders of our notes who did not put their notes back to us 
a total of million of our notes were put back to us for repurchase and a total of million of our notes remain outstanding 
the supplemental interest payment is being amortized ratably over a twelve month period to august as a result of the above  we reduced our total debt by million during this was funded out of our cash flow from operations 
looking forward to  we expect to continue to use our cash flow from operations to pay dividends and make capital expenditures  as well as to purchase treasury shares and fund acquisitions 
our outstanding debt and amounts available under these facilities at december  were as follows dollars in millions debt outstanding available credit short term borrowings due in less than one year commercial paper issued under billion credit facility due june   senior notes due april  senior notes due july  convertible notes due february  convertible notes due july  convertible notes due june  convertible notes due july  other debt total   additional information about our indebtedness is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
credit markets and availability of credit in light of the uncertainty of future economic conditions  we continue to seek to take actions available to us to respond to changing economic conditions and we will continue to actively manage our discretionary expenditures 
from august through december   we did not repurchase any significant amount of our common stock 
beginning in  we plan to resume repurchases of our common stock 
we will continue to monitor and manage the level of credit made available to our clients 
we believe that these actions  in addition to the availability of our billion credit facility  are sufficient to fund our near term working capital needs and our discretionary spending 
for additional information about our credit facility  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the next date on which holders of the notes and notes may put the notes back to us for cash is june the next date on which holders of the notes may put the notes back to us for cash is july if our convertible notes are put back to us  based on our current financial condition and expectations  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any put 
although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements  we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event 
in funding our day to day liquidity  we have historically been a participant in the commercial paper market 
disruptions in the credit markets beginning in the third quarter of and continuing into the first part of led to periods of illiquidity in the commercial paper market and higher credit spreads 
during this period  to mitigate these conditions and to fund our day to day liquidity  we used our uncommitted lines of credit and borrowed under our credit facility 
in the second half of  we resumed commercial paper issuances 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the credit markets 
we cannot predict with any certainty the impact on us of any further disruptions in the credit markets 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of our business 
the following table summarizes information about certain of our obligations at december  and should be read together with note debt  note income taxes  note leases  note fair value and note derivative instruments and hedging activities to our consolidated financial statements dollars in millions contractual obligations at december  due in less than year due in to years due in to years due in more than years total long term debt   convertible notes lease obligations  uncertain tax positions total    other contractual obligations at december  lines of credit guarantees total our liability for uncertain tax positions is subject to uncertainty as to when or if the liability will be paid 
we have assigned the liability to the period s presented based on our judgment as to when these liabilities will be resolved by the appropriate taxing authorities 
as more fully described above under the heading debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants  the holders of the convertible notes at december  included in the table above have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future 
if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date  as set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements  million of convertible notes could be due in less than one year 
the next date on which holders of our notes and notes may put the notes back to us for cash is june and the next date holders of our notes may put the notes back to us for cash is july we have classified our convertible notes as long term in our consolidated balance sheet because our credit facility does not expire until june and it is our intention to fund any put with our credit facility 
in many of our businesses we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide 
these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations  then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace  in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients 
however  this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn 
pension plan funding we maintain two us and twenty seven us noncontributory defined benefit pension plans 
the us plans have been closed to new participants 
the benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans at december  was million 
the fair value of assets for these plans at december  was million 
during  we contributed million to our defined benefit pension plans 
we do not expect our contributions to increase significantly from contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations  often referred to as earn outs 
we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the post acquisition transition period 
these payments are not contingent upon future employment 
at december   the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for acquisitions completed prior to our adoption on january   of revisions to us gaap included in codification topic  business combinations  assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels  is approximately million 
the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with us gaap prior to the revision to january   we have not recorded a liability for these items in our consolidated balance sheets since the definitive amount was not determinable or distributable prior to january  actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates 
our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period  changes in the acquired entities performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these differences could be significant 
the contingent purchase price obligations as of december   calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels  are as follows dollars in millions total in connection with the adoption of the revisions included in codification topic effective january   contingent purchase price obligations related to acquisitions completed subsequent to december  are recorded as liabilities at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and are remeasured at each reporting period and changes in fair value are recorded in our results of operations 
these liabilities are not included in the above amounts 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations  which are generally denominated in the local currency 
the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
for the most part  our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency 
this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our results of operations 
while our agencies conduct business in more than different currencies  our major non us currency markets are the european monetary union emu  the united kingdom  japan  brazil and canada 
as an integral part of our treasury operations  we enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest 
in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency  amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts 
at december   we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany borrowings and investments 
the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from to days with an average duration under days 
in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement  we enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge us dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center  whose functional currency is the british pound 
at december   we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as we had no commercial paper outstanding 
the forward foreign exchange contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks 
these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program 
as a result of these financial instruments  we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 
in using these contracts  we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk 
to minimize counterparty risk  we only enter into these contracts with major well known banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating 
these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations 
we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks 
we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a value at risk computation 
value at risk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments 
the value at risk analysis we performed on our december  portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial 
this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action  if appropriate 
interest rate risk substantially all of our long term debt is fixed rate debt and is not affected by changes in interest rates 
in managing our day to day liquidity  we may issue commercial paper  borrow under our billion credit facility or borrow under our uncommitted lines of credit 
interest on this debt is variable 
interest expense on our variable rate debt was approximately million out of our total interest expense of million for the year ended december  our billion credit facility expires on june  our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank  jpmorgan chase  hsbc  rbs  deutsche  bank of america  societe generale and bbva 
we also include large regional banks in the us such as us bancorp  northern trust  pnc and wells fargo 
we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as bnp paribas in france  sumitomo in japan  intesa san paolo in italy  scotia in canada and anz in australia 
several banks that were in our bank syndicate merged with other global financial institutions 
additionally  during the recent credit crisis  several banks in our bank syndicate received capital infusions from their central governments 
in the event that a bank in our syndicate were to default on its obligation to fund its commitment under our credit facility or cease to exist and there was no successor entity  the credit facility provides that the remaining banks in the syndicate would only be required to fund advances requested under the credit facility on a pro rata basis up to their total commitment and the portion of the credit facility provided by the defaulting bank would not be available to us 
the holders of our convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount 
the next date on which holders of our notes and notes can put the notes back to us for cash is june and the next date on which holders of our notes can put the notes back to us for cash is july as we have done on prior occasions  we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date 
if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment  the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date  including our stock price  short term interest rates and a factor for credit risk 
if the remaining outstanding convertible notes are put back to us  based on our current financial condition and expectations  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit to fund any put 
although such borrowings would reduce the amount available under our credit facility to fund our cash requirements  we believe that we have sufficient capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event 
additionally  if the convertible notes are put back to us  our interest expense will change 
the extent  if any  of the increase or decrease in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced  when we refinance  the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the refinancing 
even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar for dollar basis  it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio 
if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest bearing debt at prevailing rates  this may result in an increase in interest expense that would negatively impact our coverage ratios  such as ebitda to interest expense 
however  the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds 
if either our ratio of debt to ebitda was to double or our ratio of ebitda was to halve  we would still be in compliance with these covenants 
therefore  based on our current coverage ratios  our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets  we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements 
credit risk we provide marketing and corporate communications services to thousands of clients who operate in nearly every industry sector and in the normal course of business we grant credit to qualified clients 
due to the diversified nature of our client base  we do not believe that we are exposed to a concentration of credit risk as our largest client accounted for of our revenue  and no other client accounted for more than of our revenue for however  during periods of economic downturn  the credit profiles of our clients could change 
in many of our businesses  we purchase media for our clients and act as an agent for a disclosed principal 
we enter into contractual commitments with media providers on behalf of our clients at levels that substantially exceed our revenue in connection with the services we provide 
these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the media providers 
while operating practices vary by country  media type and media vendor  in the united states and certain foreign markets many of our contracts with media providers specify that if our client defaults on its payment obligations then we are not liable to the media providers under the legal theory of sequential liability until we have been paid for the media by our client 
in other countries  we manage our risk in other ways  including evaluating and monitoring our clients credit worthiness and  in many cases  requiring credit insurance or payment in advance 
further  in cases where we become committed to the media and it becomes apparent that a client may be unable to pay for the media  options are potentially available to us in the marketplace  in addition to those cited above to mitigate the potential loss  including negotiating with media providers 
we have not experienced a material loss related to purchases of media on behalf of our clients 
however  this risk could increase in a significant economic downturn
