item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our fiscal year typically includes weeks  comprised of three twelve week quarters and one sixteen week quarter 
every five or six years our fiscal year includes an extra or rd week in the fourth quarter 
fiscal consisted of weeks  while fiscal and fiscal consisted of weeks 
description of the business we are the number one pizza delivery company in the united states with an share of the pizza delivery market based on reported consumer spending 
we also have a leading international presence 
we operate through a network of company owned stores  all of which are in the united states  and  franchise stores located in all states and in more than international markets 
in addition  we operate regional dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the contiguous united states as well as six dough manufacturing and supply chain centers outside the contiguous united states 
in  we converted one of our dough manufacturing and supply chain centers in the united states to a thin crust manufacturing center 
this facility supplies the majority of thin crust product for our domestic stores 
our financial results are driven largely by retail sales at our company owned and franchise stores 
changes in retail sales are driven by changes in same store sales and store counts 
we monitor both of these metrics very closely  as they directly impact our revenues and profits  and strive to consistently increase both same store sales and our store counts 
retail sales drive company owned store revenues  royalty payments from franchisees and supply chain revenues 
retail sales are primarily impacted by the strength of the domino s pizza brand  the results of our marketing promotions  our ability to execute our store operating model  the overall global economic environment and other business strategies 
we devote significant attention to our brand building efforts  which is evident in our system s estimated billion of domestic advertising spending over the past five years and our frequent designation as a megabrand by advertising age 
we plan on continuing to build our brand and retail sales by satisfying customers worldwide with our pizza delivery offerings and by continuing to invest significant amounts in the advertising and marketing of the domino s pizza brand 
we also pay particular attention to the store economics  or the investment performance of a store to its owner  of both our company owned and franchise stores 
we believe that our system s favorable store economics benefit from the relatively small initial and ongoing investments required to own and operate a domino s pizza store 
we believe these favorable investment requirements  coupled with a strong brand message supported by significant advertising spending  as well as high quality and focused menu offerings  drive strong store economics  which  in turn  drive demand for new stores 
business performance at the start of  we faced a tough economic environment and challenges in our domestic business 
we focused on several areas in  including menu diversification and improving domestic store operations 
during  we continued to exit underperforming franchisees from the system which allowed us to strengthen our overall system of stores 
we made targeted investments in new training and audit programs  which we believe have resulted in better store operations 
we have also made significant changes to our marketing strategies in recent years  focusing on driving sustained traffic growth  including launching new product platforms 
in  we introduced our domino s oven baked sandwiches  which not only drove traffic growth  but also expanded our lunch business 
in  we introduced domino s american legends pizzas  domino s breadbowl pasta and chocolate lava crunch cakes  which further increased traffic and the impact of all of these strategies resulted in increased traffic in all four fiscal quarters in in addition  domino s pizza was voted in customer satisfaction in a survey of consumers of the us largest limited service restaurants  according to the annual american customer satisfaction index acsi 
further  in the fourth quarter of  we launched our inspired new pizza  which resulted in significant improvements to our core pizza product 
since the launch of our inspired new pizza  we have received significant media attention and have experienced significant increases in traffic and sales in our stores 
it is unknown if this trend will continue once we are past this initial trial period 
however  we believe momentum is building as we enter fiscal  our th year of operation 
in addition to the aforementioned efforts  other initiatives such as increases in media spending and further investments in our technology platforms are important strategies that will contribute to the growth and success of our business in and beyond 

table of contents in  global retail sales  which are total retail sales at company owned and franchise stores worldwide  increased as compared to retail sales for franchise stores are reported to the company by its franchisees and are not included in company revenues 
this increase in global retail sales was driven primarily by the inclusion of the rd week in  which positively impacted global retail sales by percentage points in additionally  global retail sales benefited from strong international same store sales growth  same store sales growth in our domestic franchise stores and growth in worldwide store counts 
these increases were offset in part by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales 
in  global retail sales increased as compared to this increase in global retail sales was driven by strong international same store sales growth as well as growth in worldwide store counts  offset in part by a decrease in domestic same store sales and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our international sales 
revenues decreased million or in and decreased million or in the decrease in revenues in was largely due to lower company owned store revenues resulting primarily from the impact of the store divestitures in  lower domestic supply chain revenues  due primarily to lower food prices  including cheese  and the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on our international revenues 
these decreases were offset  in part by the inclusion of the rd week in  which positively impacted revenues by approximately million 
the decline in was due primarily to lower company owned store and domestic franchise revenues  driven primarily by company owned store divestitures  lower same store sales and lower volumes in our domestic supply chain operations 
worldwide store counts have increased from  at the beginning of to  at the end of this growth in store counts can be attributed to the growing global acceptance of our brand and our pizza delivery concept as well as the economics inherent in our system which attracts new franchisees and encourages existing franchisees to grow their business 
domestic same store sales decreased in  decreased in and increased in international same store sales increased  and during the same periods 
the company s domestic same store sales results in and reflected the underperformance of our product and promotional offerings during those years  continued challenges in our domestic business and a weak consumer environment 
domestic same store sales in fiscal reflected the success of several initiatives  including the launch of two new product platforms domino s breadbowl pasta and domino s american legends pizzas  as well as the introduction of domino s chocolate lava crunch cakes and the introduction of our inspired new pizza during the fourth quarter of internationally  same stores sales growth continues to result from the growing acceptance of delivered pizza around the globe and the successful execution of the concept 
income from operations decreased from million in to million in and increased in income from operations in was negatively impacted by approximately million of expenses incurred in connection with the stock option exchange program as well as the incremental expense and acceleration of expense for the retirement provision added to existing stock option agreements 
furthermore  was negatively impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates affecting our international operations and higher variable bonuses related to the company s bonus program 
these decreases in were offset in part by the inclusion of the rd week in  which benefited income from operations by approximately million  by higher margins in our company owned stores and domestic supply chain business as well as domestic and international same store sales growth and store count growth in our international markets 
the growth in income from operations in was primarily the result of the million of gains on the sale of company owned stores and continued strong performance in our international business 
additionally  the comparison benefited from lower income from operations in  when we incurred higher expenses associated with the company s recapitalization and a million reserve recorded in related to certain legal matters in california 
these increases in were offset in part by lower margins in our company owned store and domestic supply chain businesses  a decrease in domestic franchise same store sales and approximately million of separation and other costs recorded related primarily to the company s reduction in force 
net income increased from million in to million in and increased in the increase in net income in was due primarily to million of pre tax gains recorded on the extinguishment of debt combined with lower interest expense in as a result of lower debt levels 
additionally  the inclusion of the rd week benefited net income in by approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in income from operations 
the increase in net income in was primarily due to the comparison to lower net income amounts in  when we incurred higher expenses associated with the company s recapitalization and the aforementioned increase in income from operations in these recapitalization expenses in included the write off of deferred financing fees and bond discount related to the extinguishment of debt and a million premium paid to repurchase and retire then outstanding notes 
these increases were offset in part by higher ongoing interest expense in associated with increased debt under our new capital structure and higher interest income earned in on funds received in connection with the company s recapitalization 

table of contents we are highly leveraged primarily as a result of our recapitalization in as of january   consolidated debt was billion 
since  a large portion of our cash flows provided from operations has been used to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness as well as distributions to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases 
our securitized debt requires interest only payments until april this interest only period can be extended for two one year periods if the company meets certain requirements in april and april based on fiscal financial results  the company has exceeded the required threshold for extension 
management currently intends to take advantage of this interest only period of payments for the full seven years to the extent such extension periods remain available to the company 
overall  we believe that our ability to consistently produce significant free cash flows allows us the flexibility not only to service our significant debt but also to invest in our growing business as well as return cash to our shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  our management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for uncollectible receivables  long lived and intangible assets  insurance and legal matters and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
changes in our accounting policies and estimates could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition for any particular period 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition 
we earn revenues through our network of domestic company owned and franchise stores  dough manufacturing and supply chain centers and international operations 
retail sales from company owned stores and royalty revenues resulting from the retail sales from franchise stores are recognized as revenues when the items are delivered to or carried out by customers 
retail sales are generally reported and related royalties paid to the company on a weekly basis based on a percentage of retail sales  as specified in the related standard franchise agreement generally of domestic franchise retail sales 
in the event that retail sales are not reported timely by a franchisee  the company will record royalty revenues in the period earned based on an estimate of the franchisee s sales  however  these estimates are not significant and have historically been materially consistent with the actual amounts 
revenues from company owned stores and royalty revenues from franchise stores fluctuate from time to time as a result of store count changes 
for example  if a company owned store that generated  in revenue in fiscal is sold to a franchisee in fiscal  revenues from company owned stores would have declined by  in fiscal  while franchise royalty revenues would have increased by only  in fiscal  as we generally collect of a domestic franchisee s retail sales 
sales of food from our supply chain centers are recognized as revenues upon delivery of the food to franchisees  while sales of equipment and supplies are generally recognized as revenues upon shipment of the related products to franchisees 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we closely monitor our accounts and notes receivable balances and provide allowances for uncollectible amounts as a result of our reviews 
these estimates are based on  among other factors  historical collection experience and a review of our receivables by aging category 
additionally  we may also provide allowances for uncollectible receivables based on specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while write offs of bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  management cannot guarantee that future write offs will not exceed historical rates 
specifically  if the financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at january   our total allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables was approximately million  compared to million as of december   representing approximately and of our consolidated gross accounts receivable in those years 
a change in our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables at january  would result in a change in reserves of approximately million and a change in income before provision for income taxes by the same amount 
currently  management does not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that were used to calculate our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivables 

table of contents long lived and intangible assets 
we record long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and capitalized software  at cost 
for acquisitions of franchise operations  we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired based on physical inspection of assets  historical experience and other information available to us regarding the acquisition 
we depreciate and amortize long lived assets using useful lives determined by us based on historical experience and other information available to us 
we evaluate the potential impairment of long lived assets based on various analyses including the projection of undiscounted cash flows  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
for company owned stores  we perform related impairment tests on an operating market basis  which the company has determined to be the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds the amount of the expected future undiscounted cash flows of that asset or the estimated fair value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to estimate the future market cash flows of company owned stores during the years presented 
same store sales fluctuations and the rates at which operating costs will fluctuate in the future are key factors in evaluating recoverability of the related assets 
if our same store sales significantly decline or if operating costs increase and we are unable to recover these costs  the carrying value of our company owned stores  by market  may be unrecoverable and we may be required to recognize an impairment charge 
at january   we determined that our long lived assets were not impaired 
a significant portion of our goodwill relates to acquisitions of domestic franchise stores and is included in our domestic stores segment  specifically  the company owned stores reporting unit 
we evaluate goodwill annually for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit  which is primarily determined using historical undiscounted cash flows multiplied by a market multiple  which is estimated based on the results of recent store sales transactions  to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  goodwill would be impaired 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment during the years presented 
at january   the fair value of our business operations with associated goodwill exceeded their recorded carrying value  including the related goodwill 
if cash flows generated by our company owned stores were to decline significantly in the future or there were negative revisions to the market multiple assumption  we may be required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge 
however  based on the latest impairment analysis  we do not believe it is reasonably likely that there could be changes in assumptions that would trigger impairment 
insurance and legal matters 
we are a party to lawsuits and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
management closely monitors these legal matters and estimates the probable costs for the resolution of such matters 
these estimates are primarily determined by consulting with both internal and external parties handling the matters and are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves  legal judgments can be volatile and difficult to predict 
accordingly  if our estimates relating to legal matters proved inaccurate for any reason  we may be required to increase or decrease the related expense in future periods 
we had accruals for legal matters of approximately million at december  and approximately million at january  for certain periods prior to december and for periods after december  we maintain insurance coverage for workers compensation  general liability and owned and non owned auto liability under insurance policies requiring payment of a deductible for each occurrence up to between  and million  depending on the policy year and line of coverage 
the related insurance reserves are based on undiscounted independent actuarial estimates  which are based on historical information along with assumptions about future events 
specifically  various methods  including analyses of historical trends and actuarial valuation methods  are utilized to estimate the cost to settle reported claims  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
the actuarial valuation methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
when estimating these liabilities  several factors are considered  including the severity  duration and frequency of claims  legal cost associated with claims  healthcare trends and projected inflation 
over the past several years  we have experienced improvements in frequency of claims  however increasing severity of claims and medical costs have partially offset these trends 
our methodology for determining our exposure has remained consistent throughout the years presented 
management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks 
while historically our actual losses have been materially consistent with our reserves  changes in assumptions for such factors as medical costs and legal actions  as well as changes in actual experience  could cause our estimates to change in the near term which could result in an increase or decrease in the related expense in future periods 
a change in our self insurance liability at january  would have affected our income before provision for income taxes by approximately million for fiscal we had accruals for insurance matters of approximately million at december  and million at january  
table of contents income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and reserves for uncertain tax positions 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using current enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid 
judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related reserves  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
these include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets  if necessary 
as of january   we had no valuation allowances recorded for deferred tax assets 
our accounting for deferred tax assets represents our best estimate of future events 
our net deferred tax assets assume that we will generate sufficient taxable income in specific tax jurisdictions  based on our estimates and assumptions 
changes in our current estimates due to unanticipated events could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
the amounts relating to taxes recorded on the balance sheet  including tax reserves  also consider the ultimate resolution of revenue agent reviews based on estimates and assumptions 
we believe we have adequately accounted for our uncertain tax positions  however  tax audits  changes in tax laws and other unforeseen matters may result in us owing additional taxes 
we adjust our reserves for uncertain tax positions when facts and circumstances change or due to the passage of time  for example the completion of a tax audit  or the expiration of a statute of limitations  or changes in penalty and interest reserves associated with uncertain tax positions 
management believes that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for these matters 
however  to the extent the final tax outcome of these matters is different than our recorded amounts  we may be required to adjust our tax reserves resulting in additional income tax expense or benefit in future periods
