overview we design  manufacture and sell high performance memory subsystems for the server  high performance computing and communications markets 
our memory subsystems consist of either dram ics or nand flash memory and other components assembled on a pcb 
we engage with our oem customers from the earliest stages of new product definition  which provides us unique insight into their full range of system architecture and performance requirements 
this close collaboration has also allowed us to develop a significant level of systems expertise 
we leverage a portfolio of proprietary technologies and design techniques  including efficient planar design  alternative packaging techniques and custom semiconductor logic  to deliver custom memory subsystems with high memory density  small form factor  high signal integrity  attractive thermal characteristics and low cost per bit 
our custom memory subsystems typically deliver performance beyond the industry standards established by the jedec 
due to their importance to overall system architecture and performance  our products must undergo lengthy qualification reviews by our oem customers  which may last up to six months or more 
in addition  in order to establish large oem customers  we have typically been required to demonstrate our ability to meet strict standards for quality  customer service and turnaround time by first supplying less complex products into a limited range of high volume applications 
consistent with the concentrated nature of the oem customer base in our target markets  a small number of large customers have historically accounted for a significant portion of our net sales 
dell and arrow electronics represented approximately and  respectively  of our net sales in dell and hewlett packard represented approximately and  respectively  of our net sales in net sales to some of our oem customers include memory modules that are qualified by us directly with the oem customer and sold to emss  for incorporation into products manufactured exclusively for the oem customer 
these net sales to emss have historically fluctuated period by period as a portion of the total net sales to these oem customers 
net sales to hon hai precision industry co 
ltd  an ems operating under the trade name foxconn that purchases memory modules from us for incorporation into products manufactured exclusively for dell  represented approximately of our net sales to dell for fiscal and approximately of our net sales to dell for fiscal key business metrics the following describes certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations that are important to management s assessment of our financial performance net sales 
net sales consist primarily of sales of our high performance memory subsystems  net of a provision for estimated returns under our right of return policies  which generally range up to days 
we generally do not have long term sales agreements with our customers 
although oem 
table of contents customers typically provide us with non binding forecasts of future product demand over specific periods of time  they generally place orders with us approximately two weeks in advance of scheduled delivery 
selling prices are typically negotiated monthly  based on competitive market conditions and the current price of dram ics and nand 
purchase orders generally have no cancellation or rescheduling penalty provisions 
we often ship our products to our customers international manufacturing sites 
all of our sales to date  however  are denominated in united states us dollars 
we also sell excess component inventory of dram ics and nand to distributors and other users of memory ics 
as compared to previous years  component inventory sales remain a relatively small percentage of net sales as a result of our efforts to diversify both our customer and product line bases 
this diversification effort has also allowed us to use components in a wider range of memory subsystems 
we expect that component inventory sales will continue to represent a minimal portion of our net sales in future periods 
cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of materials  manufacturing costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment  inventory valuation provisions  stock based compensation  and occupancy costs and other allocated fixed costs 
the dram ics and nand incorporated into our products constitute a significant portion of our cost of sales  and thus our cost of sales will fluctuate based on the current price of dram ics and nand 
we attempt to pass through such dram ic and nand flash memory cost fluctuations to our customers by frequently renegotiating pricing prior to the placement of their purchase orders 
however  the sales prices of our memory subsystems can also fluctuate due to competitive situations unrelated to the pricing of dram ics and nand  which affects gross margins 
the gross margin on our sales of excess component dram ic and nand inventory is much lower than the gross margin on our sales of our memory subsystems 
as a result  a decrease in dram ic and nand inventory sales as a percentage of our overall sales could result in an improved overall gross margin 
we assess the valuation of our inventories on a monthly basis and record a provision to cost of sales as necessary to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or net realizable value 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of employee and independent contractor compensation and related costs  stock based compensation  non recurring engineering fees  computer aided design software licenses  reference design development costs  patent filing and protection legal fees  depreciation or rental of evaluation equipment  and occupancy and other allocated overhead costs 
also included in research and development expense are the costs of material and overhead related to the production of engineering samples of new products under development or products used solely in the research and development process 
our customers typically do not separately compensate us for design and engineering work involved in developing application specific products for them 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we anticipate that research and development expenditures will increase in future periods as we seek to expand new product opportunities  increase our activities related to new and emerging markets and continue to develop additional proprietary technologies 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related costs  stock based compensation  independent sales representative commissions  professional services  promotional and other selling and marketing expenses  and occupancy and other allocated overhead costs 
a significant portion of our selling effort is directed at building relationships with oems and other customers and working through the product approval and qualification process with them 
therefore  the cost of material and overhead related to products manufactured for qualification is included in selling expenses 
as we continue to service existing and establish new customers  we anticipate that our sales and marketing expenses will increase 
beginning in fiscal  we will be subject to attestation services requirements with respect to our internal control over financial reporting  the result of which will increase legal and accounting expenses in future periods 

table of contents provision benefit for income taxes 
the federal statutory rate was for fiscal and our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate in fiscal primarily due to the establishment of a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets which caused us to record a provision for income taxes 
in fiscal  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets  and accordingly  did not recognize an income tax benefit related to losses incurred 
at january  and january   we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million and million  respectively 
we reduced its unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million during fiscal as a result of a lapse in a federal statute of limitations  resulting in an income tax benefit 
our provision benefit for income taxes is further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv  item of this report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
we review our estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may result in material adverse effects on our operating results and financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic accordingly  we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement  product delivery and acceptance have occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders and or contracts as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped for customers with fob shipping point terms and upon receipt for customers with fob destination terms  at which time title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery and customer acceptance 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund 
customers are generally allowed limited rights of return for up to days  except for sales of excess inventories  which contain no right of return privileges 
estimated returns are provided for at the time of sale based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
we offer a standard product warranty to our customers and have no other post shipment obligations 
while these sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience similar sales return rates in the future 
any significant increase in product return rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and evaluations  as well as the customer s payment history 
historically  a portion of our shipments were made to third party inventory warehouses  or hubs  and we recognized revenue when the inventory was pulled from the hub for use in production by the customer 
we received a report from the customer on a daily basis indicating the inventories pulled from a hub for use by the customer  and performed a daily reconciliation of inventories shipped to and 
table of contents pulled by the customer to those inventories reflected on the customer s reports to ensure that sales were recognized in the appropriate periods 
all amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as net sales  while all costs incurred by us for shipping and handling are classified as cost of sales 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  investments in marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses and debt instruments 
other than for certain investments in auction rate securities see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report  the fair value of our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities is determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets  or level inputs 
we believe that the carrying values of all other financial instruments approximate their current fair values due to their nature and respective durations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended to our customers as deemed necessary  but generally require no collateral 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations subsequent to the original sale  we will record an allowance against amounts due  and thereby reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we record allowances for doubtful accounts based primarily on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and its historical experience 
generally  our credit losses have been within our expectations and the provisions established 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience credit loss rates similar to those we have experienced in the past 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated among a small number of customers  and a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the net realizable value of the inventory 
cost is determined on an average cost basis which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and includes raw materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate ending inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess quantities and obsolescence 
among other factors  we consider historical demand and forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand  competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable value 
in addition  we consider changes in the market value of dram ics and nand in determining the net realizable value of our raw material inventory 
once established  any write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of our excess or obsolete inventories 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventories are determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventories are determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of sales in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventories are sold 
in addition  should the market value of dram ics or nand decrease significantly  we may be required to lower our selling prices to reflect the lower current cost of our raw materials 
if such price decreases reduce the net realizable value of our inventories to less than our 
table of contents cost  we would be required to recognize additional expense in our cost of sales in the same period 
although we make every reasonable effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological developments or the market value of dram ics or nand could have a material effect on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets held and used in our operations for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amount 
these projected future cash flows may vary significantly over time as a result of increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices 
if the carrying value is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset or asset group is based on market value when available  or when unavailable  on discounted expected cash flows 
warranty reserve 
we offer product warranties generally ranging from one to three years  depending on the product and negotiated terms of purchase agreements with our customers 
such warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
warranties are not offered on sales of excess inventory 
our estimates for warranty related costs are recorded at the time of sale based on historical and estimated future product return rates and expected repair or replacement costs 
while such costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  unexpected changes in failure rates could have a material adverse impact on us  requiring additional warranty reserves  and adversely affecting our gross profit and gross margins 
stock based compensation 
we account for equity issuances to non employees in accordance with asc topic all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for the issuance of equity instruments are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the measurement date used to determine the fair value of the equity instrument issued is the earlier of the date on which the third party performance is complete or the date on which it is probable that performance will occur 
in accordance with asc topic  employee and director stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
given that stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc topic requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
our estimated average forfeiture rates are based on historical forfeiture experience and estimated future forfeitures 
the fair value of common stock option awards to employees and directors is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires subjective assumptions regarding future stock price volatility and expected time to exercise  along with assumptions about the risk free interest rate and expected dividends  all of which affect the estimated fair values of our common stock option awards 
the expected term of options granted is calculated as the average of the weighted vesting period and the contractual expiration date of the option 
this calculation is based on the safe harbor method permitted by the sec in instances where the vesting and exercise terms of options 
table of contents granted meet certain conditions and where limited historical exercise data is available 
prior to fiscal  the expected volatility was based on the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies based on our belief that we had limited historical data regarding the volatility of our stock price on which to base a meaningful estimate of expected volatility 
beginning in fiscal  the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the risk free rate selected to value any particular grant is based on the us treasury rate that corresponds to the expected term of the grant effective as of the date of the grant 
the expected dividends assumption is based on our history and our expectations regarding dividend payouts 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our common stock option awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in prior periods 
compensation expense for awards with graded vesting schedules is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the last separately vesting portion of the award 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying vested or unvested stock based awards  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense  or record additional expense for vested stock based awards 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation may increase to the extent that we grant additional common stock options or other stock based awards 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the estimated future tax effects  calculated at currently effective tax rates  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized on a cumulative basis in the consolidated financial statements 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  when determined necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
because we operated at a loss for an extended period of time  we were required to record a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets in fiscal  and have not recognized tax deferred tax assets related to losses incurred in fiscal in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record an income tax benefit or a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
asc topic prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement requirement for the financial statement recognition of a tax position that has been taken or is expected to be taken on a tax return and also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
under asc topic we may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities

table of contents net sales 
the overall decrease in our net sales was primarily driven by a sharp reduction in demand from our current customer base  due to the commoditization and end of life cycle of some of our current product offerings 
we continue to transition to a new business strategy focused on the development of high margin subsystems based on custom logic devices 
the decrease in net sales for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to the fiscal year ended january   resulted primarily from decreases of approximately i million in net sales of certain high density memory modules for the server market and related applications as a result of our oem customers transition from ddr fbdimms to next generation ddr rdimms  and ii million in net sales of sodimm subsystems used in laptop personal computers as a result of component standardization and competition from dram suppliers 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in net sales of rdimms used in raid controller subsystems 
throughout fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we experienced relatively flat sales in raid component sales as dell transitioned to its next generation of servers  however  this trend reversed in the latter half of fiscal  in correlation with dell s product launch 
sales of our component inventory to distributors and other users of memory ics represented approximately and of net sales for the fiscal years ended january  and january   respectively 
as compared to the previous year  component inventory sales increased as we purchased inventory for a sale that we did not fulfill 
gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit for the fiscal year ended january  as compared to the year ended january  decreased primarily due to the decrease in net sales between the comparative periods 
the increase in gross margin for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to the fiscal year ended january   was mainly due to the reduction in sales of commoditized laptop memory products in fiscal compared with fiscal and a weighting of our product mix toward higher margin products  such as those used in raid controller subsystems 
gross margin improvements were also a result of improved conditions in the dram market 
these gross margin improvements were offset by an inability to absorb manufacturing costs caused by the significant drop in units manufactured and sold during fiscal research and development 
the following table presents research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended january  and january  in thousands  except percentages year ended january  january  increase change research and development the increase in research and development expense for the fiscal year ended january   as compared to the fiscal year ended january   resulted primarily from increases of approximately i million in outside engineering costs for new products under development and ii million in legal and professional fees as we continue to increase patent filing and protection activities related to new and emerging markets 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately million in expenses related to in house product qualification builds and testing as we focused our efforts on product development during the year

net interest income for the fiscal year ended january  was comprised of interest income of approximately million  partially offset by interest expense of approximately million 
the decrease in interest income in the fiscal year ended january   as compared to the fiscal year ended january   was due to a combination of our lower overall cash and investment balances and the decrease in the yield earned on those balances due to lower interest rates 
the decrease in interest expense during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  resulted primarily from our lower average outstanding balances on our line of credit and debt balances during fiscal other expense  net  primarily includes gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and on dispositions of property and equipment in fiscal and provision benefit for income taxes

table of contents the federal statutory rate was for fiscal and in fiscal  our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report 
we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets generated in fiscal  consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards 
included in the unrecognized tax benefits at january  and january  was approximately million and million  respectively  of tax positions that  if recognized  would affect our annual effective tax rate 
we reduced our unrecognized tax benefits by approximately million during fiscal as a result of a lapse in a federal statute of limitations  resulting in an income tax benefit 
in fiscal  we began operating under tax holidays in the prc  which are effective from january through december since we operated at a loss in the prc in fiscal and  we did not realize any benefit attributable to the tax holidays 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through issuances of equity and debt securities and cash generated from operations 
we have also funded our operations with a revolving line of credit under our bank credit facility  capitalized lease obligations  financing of receivables and from the sale and leaseback of our domestic manufacturing facility 
working capital and cash and marketable securities 
the following table presents working capital  cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities in thousands january  january  working capital cash and cash equivalents short term marketable securities long term marketable securities included in working capital our working capital decreased in the fiscal year ended january  primarily as a result of a decrease in cash and short term investments in marketable securities of million and income tax receivable of million used to support operations

net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily the result of a net loss of approximately million offset by i approximately million in net non cash operating expenses  mainly comprised of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation and ii approximately million in net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities  primarily income taxes receivable and accounts payable 
despite relatively flat sales in the last quarter of compared with  accounts receivable increased approximately million at january  compared with january   primarily as a result of the timing of sales within the last quarter of each fiscal year 
during fiscal  we were successful in collecting cash from sales to our customers substantially in accordance with our standard payment terms to those customers 
inventories decreased approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of the overall decline in our net sales during the year 
in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based on  among other factors  the level of customer orders received and overall demand as well as the stage at which our products are in their respective life cycles and competitive situations in the marketplace 
we make efforts to balance such considerations against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
accounts payable increased approximately million during fiscal primarily as a result of spending on legal and consulting services in support of our new product development and stringent cash management 
net cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily the result of a net loss of approximately million offset by i approximately million in net non cash operating expenses  mainly comprised of depreciation and amortization  provision for bad debts  stock based compensation  impairment of long lived assets and deferred income taxes and ii approximately million in net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities 
investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily the result of proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities of approximately million  partially offset by purchases of investments in marketable securities of approximately million 
in fiscal  we continued to invest remaining net proceeds from our initial public offering  in various marketable securities investments in connection with our efforts to both preserve capital as well as achieve competitive returns on our investments 
net cash provided by investing activities for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily the result of proceeds from the maturities and sales of marketable securities of approximately million  partially offset by purchases of investments in marketable securities of approximately million 
our investment strategies were consistent in fiscal and we also used approximately million 
table of contents in cash primarily to purchase equipment and leasehold improvements related to our new facilities in the prc and in irvine  california 
financing activities 
in fiscal  we utilized our line of credit to fund short term working capital needs through its expiration on august  net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended january  was the result of million in debt repayment  offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock 
net cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended january  was primarily the result of net repayments on our outstanding revolving line of credit of approximately million  along with repayments on our long term debt of approximately million 
capital resources 
our credit facility  which consisted of a revolving line of credit and a non revolving equipment line of credit  expired on august  and all borrowings were repaid to the bank 
under our previous revolving line of credit  we were able to borrow up to the greater of of eligible accounts receivable plus the least of i a percentage of eligible inventory determined from time to time by its bank  ii of the orderly liquidation value  as defined  of eligible inventories  and iii million 
under the equipment line  we were allowed to borrow up to million through january  interest on the credit facility was payable monthly at the greatest of i the sum of the prime rate plus  ii libor plus or iii 
on october   we entered into a revolving credit agreement with another financial institution 
under the credit agreement  we may borrow up to the lesser of i of eligible accounts receivable  minus million  or ii million 
the credit agreement contains an overall sublimit of million to collateralize our contingent obligations under letters of credit  foreign exchange contracts and cash management services 
amounts outstanding under the overall sublimit reduce the amount available pursuant to the credit agreement 
this revolving credit agreement subjects us to certain affirmative and negative covenants  including financial covenants with respect to our liquidity and profitability 
interest is payable monthly at either i prime plus  as long as we maintains million in revolving credit availability plus unrestricted cash on deposit with the financial institution  or ii prime plus 
the credit agreement matures on october   at which time all advances and interest are due and payable 
the following table presents details of outstanding borrowings and availability under our lines of credit in thousands  except percentages january  january  outstanding borrowings on the line of credit outstanding borrowings on the equipment line of credit borrowing availability under the line of credit prime rate obligations under our current revolving credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien on our tangible and intangible assets 
in connection with the revolving credit agreement  we entered into an intercompany subordination agreement  which provided that our subsidiary  netlist technology texas  lp  is an additional obligor on the revolving credit agreement 
while we expect to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement for the foreseeable future  we have in the past been in violation of one or more covenants included in previously existing credit agreements 
we cannot assure you that we will not violate one or 
table of contents more covenants in the future 
if we were to be in violation of covenants under our new revolving credit agreement  our lender could choose to accelerate payment on all outstanding loan balances and could refuse to fund advances under the line of credit 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to quickly obtain equivalent or suitable replacement financing in this event 
if we were not able to secure alternative sources of funding  such acceleration or lack of availability would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
we have in the past utilized equipment leasing arrangements to finance certain capital expenditures 
equipment leases will continue to be a financing alternative that we may pursue in the future 
in order to become profitable or to achieve and sustain positive cash flows from operations in the future  we must further reduce operating expenses and or increase our revenues 
during fiscal and  we completed a series of cost reduction actions which we believe have improved our operating cost structure 
these expense reductions alone may not make us profitable or allow us to sustain profitability if it is achieved 
our ability to achieve the necessary revenue growth will depend on  among other things  increased demand for our memory subsystems and related product offerings  as well as our ability to expand into new and emerging markets 
we may not be successful in achieving the necessary revenue growth 
moreover  we may be unable to sustain past or expected future expense reductions in subsequent periods 
we may not achieve profitability or sustain such profitability  if achieved  on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
we believe our existing cash and investment balances  borrowing availability under our bank credit facility  and the cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  during challenging economic times we may face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit  which could result in our inability to meet certain of our financial obligations and other related commitments 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our levels of net sales  the timing and extent of expenditures to support research and development activities  the expansion of manufacturing capacity both domestically and internationally and the continued market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or may choose  to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt financings or equity offerings or a combination thereof 
these additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt  and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu  which amends the revenue guidance under asc topic  which describes the accounting for multiple element arrangements 
asu addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how arrangement consideration shall be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for
