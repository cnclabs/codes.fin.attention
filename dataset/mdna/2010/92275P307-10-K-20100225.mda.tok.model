item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and the other information appearing in this report 
as used in this report  unless the context otherwise indicates  references to we  our  ours  and us refer to venoco  inc and its subsidiaries collectively 
overview we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties 
our strategy is to grow through exploration  exploitation and development projects we believe to be relatively low risk and through selective acquisitions of underdeveloped properties 
our average net production was  boe d in compared to  boe d in and  boe d in excluding production from the hastings complex  which we sold on february  see acquisitions and divestitures  our average net production was  boe d in  compared to  boe d in and  boe d in our proved reserves were mmboe at december   compared to mmboe at december  and mmboe at december  excluding reserves attributable to the hastings complex  our reserves increased from mmboe at december  and mmboe at december  to mmboe at december  in the execution of our strategy  our management is principally focused on developing additional reserves of oil and natural gas and on maximizing production levels through exploration  exploitation and development activities on a cost effective basis and in a manner consistent with preserving adequate liquidity and financial flexibility 
capital expenditures we have developed an active capital expenditure program to take advantage of our extensive inventory of drilling prospects and other projects 
our development  exploitation and exploration capital expenditures were million in  down from million in our development  exploitation and exploration capital expenditure budget is million  of which approximately is expected to be deployed in the southern california region  in the sacramento basin  in texas and the remaining going towards onshore monterey shale exploration in southern california 
we have entered into hedging arrangements to secure floors on approximately of our forecast production 
the price floors are intended to ensure a minimum cash flow stream to sustain an active capital expenditure program and satisfy our other obligations 
the aggregate levels of capital expenditures for  and the allocation of those expenditures  are dependent on a variety of factors  including the availability of capital resources to fund the expenditures and changes in our business assessments as to where our capital can be most profitably employed 
accordingly  the actual levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of those expenditures may vary materially from our estimates 
we expect to finance part of our capital expenditures with proceeds from one or more capital raising transactions  and would expect to reduce our capital expenditure budget for the year if we do not complete such a transaction 
the following summarizes certain significant aspects of our capital spending program and the outlook for southern california exploitation and development our primary focus in southern california in was on development activities in the west montalvo field  where we continued the workover  recompletion and return to production program that we began when we acquired the field in may we have more than doubled production at west montalvo since acquiring the field and anticipate an active development program in the coming years as we drill the locations we have identified in the field 
the field has not been fully delineated 
table of contents offshore or fully developed onshore so the number of drilling locations could increase as our development continues 
during  we completed two wells that were spud during the fourth quarter of  and also spud two additional wells  one late in the third quarter and the other in the fourth quarter  that had not been completed by year end 
we expect both wells spud during the latter part of to be completed and online during the first quarter of we plan to drill three additional wells in the field later in  but will not realize a full year s production from successful drilling until in the sockeye field  we continue to optimize our waterflood program from platform gail 
during  we drilled a dual completion well that produces from the monterey shale formation and expands the waterflood by injecting into the upper topanga formation 
in  we plan to drill two wells  including another dual completion well 
if the dual completion well is successful  it would produce from the monterey shale formation and inject into the lower topanga formation  increasing the sweep of the waterflood in that zone 
the second new well will be a redrill of a monterey shale well in which the casing has collapsed 
we also completed our first hydraulic fracture in the offshore monterey shale in january  and are currently evaluating the results of the fracture 
depending on its success  we may opt to perform a second fracture on the planned redrill 
we also have a number of development opportunities in the south ellwood field 
in  we expect to perform workovers and recompletions on five wells at the field 
we also plan to advance the permitting process for three of the five proved undeveloped locations on our existing leases and perform the facilities work in order to begin drilling those locations in in addition  our subsidiary ellwood pipeline  inc is pursuing the permits necessary to build a common carrier pipeline that would allow us to transport our oil from the south ellwood field to refiners without the use of a barge or the marine terminal 
we anticipate that approval hearings for the project will not be held before the second half of while we believe the pipeline should be approved  the outcome of these hearings cannot be predicted 
pending regulatory approvals and completion of the pipeline  we expect to use our current barge and a second  double hulled barge the new barge to transport oil production from the field 
we recently obtained permits that will allow us to use the new barge through may  on a limited basis and subject to its other delivery commitments  if the current barge is out of service 
we are pursuing the permits necessary to use the new barge on a full time basis  and expect to receive them no later than may subject to the receipt of those permits  we expect to transition to use of the new barge in connection with the termination of the contract for the current barge  which will occur contemporaneously with the availability of the new barge 
we have entered into a new sales agreement with a major oil company  effective march  which allows us to use the current barge until the new barge is available to transport production 
the sales contract is terminable by either party with days notice after august we also continue to pursue a major lease extension in the south ellwood field 
the lease extension would effectively double the size of the existing lease area 
development of the lease extension area can be accomplished from the field s existing platform 
as described in business and properties description of properties southern california south ellwood field  however  we may withdraw the application for the lease extension project if we determine that continuing the permitting process for that project is likely to impede significantly the permitting of the pipeline project 

table of contents sacramento basin exploitation and development in the sacramento basin  we continue to pursue our infill drilling program in the greater grimes and willows fields 
during  we spud wells  completed including wells spud in  and performed recompletions in the basin 
due in part to declining natural gas prices  our focus in the basin in was on drilling relatively low risk locations rather than testing the boundary of producing areas as in prior years 
our budget contemplates similar levels of drilling and workover activity 
as of december   we had identified drilling locations in the basin  and we anticipate identifying additional locations as we pursue exploitation and development opportunities there 
we continue to test and evaluate potential downspacing opportunities in the basin as well as new methods of improving productivity and reducing drilling costs 
of the wells completed in the basin during  all but one were drilled on acre spacing 
we also continue to pursue our hydraulic fracturing program in the basin  a program that we initiated in november we believe our analysis of the results to date will enable us to identify consistent targets for future fracture stimulations in the basin 
we fractured two wells during  and plan to fracture six wells in we have been encouraged by the results and continue to analyze those results in order to optimize future fracture simulations in the basin 
as of december   our acreage position in the basin had grown to approximately  net acres  gross 
texas exploitation and development we are currently engaged in actively marketing all of our oil and gas interests in the texas properties 
we expect to use the proceeds from the sale of the texas assets to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt and fund operations 
following the sale of the hastings complex  our largest operated field in texas is the manvel field 
we have utilized the knowledge and experience we gained operating the hastings complex to implement a redevelopment program for this field 
this program consists mainly of returning idle wells to production  increasing the lift capacity of existing wells  working over and recompleting existing wells in different producing sands  upgrading surface facility fluid handling capacity and increasing water injection capabilities 
in addition  we are in the process of unitizing the manvel field and believe it is a solid candidate for a co flood operation 
during  we performed five workovers at the manvel field and workovers at our other texas properties 
we also completed a well in the south liberty field 
our capital budget includes capital to participate in four new development wells and return five wells to production in texas 
if our efforts to sell our texas assets are successful  we intend to reallocate any remaining portion of the texas capital budget to other projects 
exploration activities in  we began actively leasing onshore acreage in southern california targeting the monterey shale formation 
our leasing strategy has focused on areas where we believe the monterey shale will produce light  sweet oil and where the quality and depth of the monterey shale is expected to be advantageous 
we plan to devote approximately of our million capital expenditure budget for  or million  on activities targeting the onshore monterey shale formation 
to date  our onshore monterey shale acreage position is approximately  net acres  and we intend to aggressively add to this position in we also plan to acquire d seismic data during the year and drill five vertical test wells targeting the formation 
we spud the first of these test wells in january 

table of contents acquisitions and divestitures sacramento basin asset acquisition 
on june   we closed on the acquisition of certain natural gas producing properties in the sacramento basin  which we purchased from aspen exploration corporation and certain other parties for approximately million 
we paid for this acquisition with cash on hand and approximately million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
hastings sale 
in february  we completed the sale of our principal interests in the hastings complex to denbury for approximately million 
as a result of the sale  we repaid all amounts then outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million of the outstanding principal balance on our second lien term loan facility 
west montalvo and manvel acquisitions 
we acquired the west montalvo field in ventura county  california in may for approximately million 
we acquired the manvel field in brazoria county  texas  and certain other fields in texas  in april for million 
potential sale of texas assets 
we are currently engaged in actively marketing all of our properties in texas 
net production from our texas properties for the fourth quarter of averaged  boe d 
the texas properties comprised of our proved reserves at december  or mmboe 
we expect to use the proceeds from the sale of the texas assets to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt and fund operations 
other 
we have an active acreage acquisition program and we regularly engage in acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  dispositions of oil and natural gas properties  primarily in and around our existing core areas of operations  including several transactions in each of  and trends affecting our results of operations oil and natural gas prices 
historically  prices received for our oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and that volatility is expected to continue 
changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact many aspects of our business  including our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  liquidity  rate of growth  the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  all of which depend primarily or in part upon those prices 
for example  due primarily to lower commodities prices  our revenues from oil and gas sales and cash flow from operations declined and  respectively  in compared to in order to reduce the variability of the prices we receive for our production and provide a minimum revenue stream  we employ a hedging strategy 
as of february  we had hedge contract floors covering approximately of our annual production guidance and a significant portion of our expected production in we have also begun to secure hedge contracts for our production 
all of our derivatives counterparties are members  or affiliates of members  of our revolving credit facility syndicate 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity derivative transactions for further details concerning our hedging activities 
expected production 
in  we intend to emphasize the development of our robust inventory of oil projects  primarily at our southern california properties 
because some of these projects will require significant time for implementation  much of the production growth we expect from those projects will not be realized until after accordingly  while we believe that these projects  if successful  will result in significant production growth in subsequent years  we expect our average daily production in will be similar to our production levels  or approximately  boe d 
this estimate assumes i a full year of production from our texas properties  some or all of which we may sell during the year and ii a capital expenditure budget for of million  a budget that could be reduced if we do not complete one or more capital raising transactions 
additional uncertainties relating to our expectations for future production rates include those associated with third party 
table of contents services  oil and natural gas prices  events resulting in unexpected downtime  permitting issues  drilling success rates  pipeline capacity and other factors  including those referenced in risk factors 
production expenses 
production expenses consist of lease operating expenses loe and production and property taxes 
loe per boe decreased from per boe in to per boe in  primarily due to the sale of the relatively high cost hastings properties in the first quarter of we expect our loe per boe to increase slightly relative to due to our expected focus on oil projects  which tend to have higher operating costs than natural gas projects 
we expect production property taxes to remain relatively flat on a per boe basis compared to our results 
our expectations with respect to future expenses are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those described and referenced in the preceding paragraph 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased from per boe for excluding share based compensation charges of per boe and non recurring charges of per boe relating to the termination of a planned master limited partnership mlp offering  to per boe excluding share based compensation charges of per boe in excluding share based compensation charges  on a per boe basis  we expect our g a costs to be similar to our results 
as with production expenses  our expectations with respect to g a costs are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a 
dd a decreased from per boe in to per boe in the decrease is principally due to a reduced amortizable base as a result of the full cost ceiling write down recorded at december  and the application of proceeds from the sale of the hastings complex in february to reduce the full cost pool 
we expect our dd a expenses to increase slightly on a per boe basis compared to our results 
as with production and g a expenses  our expectations with respect to dd a expenses are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
unrealized derivative gains and losses 
decreases in both oil and natural gas prices led to significant unrealized commodity derivative gains in the first quarter of  while increases in commodity prices primarily oil resulted in unrealized commodity derivative losses in the last three quarters of these unrealized gains and losses resulted from mark to market valuations of derivative positions that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges and are reflected as unrealized commodity derivative gains or losses in our income statement 
payments actually due to or from counterparties in the future on these derivatives will typically be offset by corresponding changes in prices ultimately received from the sale of our production 
we have incurred significant gains and losses of this type in recent periods and may continue to incur these types of gains and losses in the future 
we may also have significant unrealized interest rate derivative gains and losses in subsequent periods due to changes in market interest rates

net of amounts capitalized 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was due to a decline in average sales prices in addition to lower production in as compared to  which resulted from the hastings sale as described below 

table of contents oil sales decreased by million in to million compared to million in oil production decreased by  with production of  mbbl in compared to  mbbl in the production decrease was due to the sale of the hastings complex in early february excluding hastings  production increased mbbl from  mbbl in to  mbbl in the increase is primarily due to increased production at the west montalvo field as a result of drilling and recompletion activities in the latter half of and our average realized price for oil decreased to per bbl for natural gas sales decreased million in to million compared to million in natural gas production increased  with production of  mmcf in compared to  mmcf in the increase was due primarily to drilling and recompletion activities in the sacramento basin as well as production from wells acquired in the sacramento basin asset acquisition in june our average realized price for natural gas decreased to per mcf for other revenues 
other revenues were relatively consistent at million in and million in production expenses 
production expenses  which consist of lease operating expenses loe and production property taxes  decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to the sale of hastings  which was historically a relatively high cost field 
on a per unit basis  loe decreased to per boe in from per boe in excluding hastings  loe per boe decreased from per boe in to per boe in in  we incurred relatively high non recurring maintenance costs related to certain wells in the sockeye field  which were not incurred in additionally  we incurred scheduled maintenance costs in related to platform gail in the sockeye field that we did not incur in we were also able to achieve certain price cost reductions from external contractors and suppliers during which reduced our overall loe costs 
transportation expenses 
transportation expenses decreased million to million in from million in on a per boe basis  transportation expenses decreased per boe  from per boe in to per boe in the decrease is primarily due to maintenance costs incurred in related to the barge that transports south ellwood oil production  which were not incurred in depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a 
dd a expense decreased million to million in from million in dd a expense decreased per boe  from per boe in to per boe in the decrease is principally due to a reduced depletable base as a result of the full cost ceiling write down recorded at december  and the application of proceeds from the hastings sale in february to reduce the full cost pool 
accretion of abandonment liability 
accretion expense increased million to million in from million in the increase was due to revisions to estimated liabilities recorded in the fourth quarter of and accretion from new wells drilled and completed in and

the following table summarizes the components of general and administrative expense incurred during the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  other general and administrative costs share based compensation costs general and administrative costs capitalized general and administrative expense g a expense decreased million to million in from million in the decrease is primarily related to million of costs that were expensed in the second quarter of related to the cancellation of a planned mlp offering 
the decrease also resulted from an increase in the g a costs that were capitalized in for payroll and related overhead for activities that are directly involved in our development  exploitation  exploration and acquisition efforts 
additionally  we incurred lower legal professional fees and travel costs in compared to non cash share based compensation expense charged to g a decreased million from million in to million in  primarily as a result of certain awards that became fully vested in the first quarter of excluding the effect of the non cash share based compensation expense charges and mlp write off charges  g a expense decreased from per boe in to per boe in interest expense  net 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in our average debt outstanding and lower interest rates realized during amortization of deferred loan costs 
amortization of deferred loan costs decreased million from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to amendments to the revolving credit facility in may and december which extended the maturity date of the facility 
the decrease was partially offset by increases to deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of our million senior notes in october interest rate derivative gains losses  net 
changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap derivative instruments resulted in unrealized gains of million in and unrealized losses of million in unrealized interest rate gains losses represent the change in the fair value of our interest rate derivative contracts from period to period based on estimated future interest rates at the end of the reporting period 
realized interest rate swap losses were million in compared to realized losses of million in loss on extinguishment of debt 
we recognized losses on extinguishment of debt in of million related to repayment of the financed derivative premiums balance in may and the refinancing of our million senior notes in october

the realized commodity derivative gains in reflect the settlement of contracts at prices below the relevant strike prices  while the realized derivative losses in the period reflect the settlement of contracts at prices above the relevant strike prices 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we unwound certain oil collars and purchased oil swaps with the proceeds 
we also unwound certain gas puts to bring our hedge position in line with our production guidance 
as a result of these transactions  we realized non recurring gains of million which are reflected in the realized commodity derivative gains 
unrealized commodity derivative gains losses represent the change in the fair value of our open derivative contracts from period to period 
derivative premiums are amortized over the term of the underlying derivative contracts 
income tax expense benefit 
we incurred losses before income taxes in and these losses were a key consideration that led us to provide a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at december  and since we could not conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be recognized 
the current tax benefit for of million reflects a reduction of prior year current tax expense a million benefit and  due to the temporary five year carryback period that became available in  a carryback of net operating losses a million benefit 
the valuation allowance resulted in income tax expense of million in net income loss 
net loss for was million compared to net loss of million for the change between years is the result of the items discussed above 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales increased million to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to a increase in production and an increase in average sales prices as described below 
oil sales increased by million in to million compared to million in oil production rose  with production of  mbbl in compared to  mbbl in the production increase was attributable primarily to a full year of production from the manvel field  which was acquired in april  and the west montalvo field  which was acquired in may  and to our workover program in the hastings complex  offset by the natural decline of production 
our average realized price for oil increased to per bbl for the period 
natural gas sales increased million in to million compared to million in natural gas production increased  with production of  mmcf compared to  mmcf in the increase was due primarily to drilling and recompletion

other revenues 
other revenue was relatively constant at million in compared to million in production expenses 
production expenses  which consist of lease operating expenses loe and production property taxes  increased million to million in from million in the increase was due to i a significant increase in electricity usage and rates in texas in  ii non recurring maintenance costs incurred at sockeye in  iii the effect of twelve full months of expense related to the manvel and west montalvo acquisitions  which occurred in april and may  respectively  and iv an increase in secured and supplemental property taxes related to our california properties

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operations and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
cash flows years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  down from million in and million in cash flows from operating activities in were unfavorably impacted by significant decreases in commodity prices 
net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in the primary investing activities in were million in capital expenditures for our oil and gas exploration and development programs together with million paid to acquire certain sacramento basin assets 
these total expenditures of million were offset by the receipt of in cash proceeds from the sale of our hastings complex in texas 
the primary investing activities in include million in expenditures for oil and gas properties and million for acquisitions 
the primary investing activities in include million in expenditures for oil and gas properties and million paid to acquire the west montalvo and manvel fields and other properties 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in the primary financing activities in were as follows i we made net repayments of million on our revolving credit facility and million of principal payments on the second lien term loan  both of which were primarily funded with proceeds from the hastings sale  ii we paid approximately million in may to settle financed derivative premiums  iii in october  we refinanced our senior notes with the issuance of our senior notes  which resulted in a principal repayment of million and a premium payment of million 
from the issuance of the notes  we received cash of million  net of the million original issue discount 
we incurred million in debt issuance costs related to the senior notes refinancing 
additionally  we incurred million of debt issuance costs related to the third amendment and restatement of the agreement governing the revolving credit facility  which we entered into in december the primary financing activities in were million in net borrowings under the revolving credit facility to fund capital expenditures and working capital needs 
the primary financing activities in were million in net borrowings under the second lien term loan facility to fund capital expenditures and working capital needs and million in net borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
net proceeds from an additional offering of common stock completed in july were million  of which million was used to reduce amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  the remainder was used to fund our capital expenditure program 
capital resources and requirements we plan to make substantial capital expenditures in the future for the acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties 
we expect that our exploration  exploitation and development capital expenditures  which were million in  will be approximately million in we expect to fund our capital expenditure budget primarily 
table of contents with cash flow from operations  supplemented with proceeds from capital raising transactions that may include asset sales  joint venture transactions and or an issuance of equity 
in particular  we will seek to finance part of the planned capital expenditures relating to our monterey shale development project through a joint venture  and will seek to fund additional expenditures and or reduce indebtedness through the sale of some or all of our texas properties 
if we are unable to complete one or more of those transactions on terms acceptable to us  however  we would currently expect to reduce our capital expenditure budget to approximate our cash flow from operations 
in some circumstances  we would be required to use proceeds from the sale of texas assets to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities 
also  a sale of some or all of our texas assets could result in a reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility 
additional uncertainties relating to our capital resources and requirements in include the possibility that one or more of the counterparties to our hedging arrangements may fail to perform under the contracts  the effects of changes in commodity prices and differentials and the possibility that we will pursue one or more significant acquisitions that would require additional debt or equity financing 
amended revolving credit facility 
in december  we entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility  which now has a maturity date of january  the agreement contains customary representations  warranties  events of default  indemnities and covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness  require us to maintain derivative contracts covering a portion of our anticipated production and require us to maintain specified ratios of current assets to current liabilities and debt to ebitda 
the minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities as those terms are defined in the agreement is one to one  the maximum ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement is four to one 
while we do not expect to be in violation of any of our debt covenants during  we believe that it will be important to monitor the debt to ebitda ratio requirement  especially if our ebitda is less than we expect due to operational problems or other factors  or if our borrowing needs are greater than we expect 
the agreement requires us to reduce amounts outstanding under the facility with the proceeds of certain transactions or events  including sales of assets  in certain circumstances 
the revolving credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
loans under the revolving credit facility designated as base rate loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to i the greater of x bank of montreal s announced base rate  y the overnight federal funds rate plus and z the one month libor plus  plus ii an applicable margin ranging from to  based upon utilization 
loans designated as libo rate loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at i libor plus ii an applicable margin ranging from to  based upon utilization 
a commitment fee of per annum is payable with respect to unused borrowing availability under the facility 
the revolving credit facility has a total capacity of million  but is limited by a borrowing base currently established at million 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination twice each year  and may be redetermined at other times at our request or at the request of the lenders 
lending commitments under the facility have been allocated at various percentages to a syndicate of ten banks 
certain of the institutions included in the syndicate have received support from governmental agencies in connection with events in the credit markets 
a failure of any members of the syndicate to fund under the facility  or a reduction in the borrowing base  would adversely affect our liquidity 
as a result of the hastings sale in february  we repaid the then outstanding balance of the facility in full 
since repayment of the facility in february  we have borrowed approximately million net of principal repayments through february   to finance certain derivative premiums  to fund the sacramento basin asset acquisition  to satisfy and discharge our senior notes and to fund other operating needs 
second lien term loan 
we entered into a million senior secured second lien term loan agreement in may the term loan agreement contains customary representations  warranties  
table of contents events of default and indemnities and certain customary operational covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
the agreement requires us to maintain derivative contracts covering at least of our projected oil and natural gas production attributable to proved developed producing reserves through may   and at least of such production on an annual basis until the maturity date of the term loan 
we cannot  however  enter into derivative contracts other than certain put contracts covering more than of such projected oil and gas production in any month 
the agreement also prohibits us from paying dividends on our common stock 
the agreement will require us to make offers to prepay amounts outstanding under the second lien term loan facility with the proceeds of certain transactions or events  including sales of assets  in certain circumstances 
amounts prepaid under the facility may not be reborrowed 
the term loan facility is secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
we repaid million of principal under the facility in february after the hastings sale 
as a result of the refinancing of our senior notes  the maturity date of the principal on the second lien term loan was extended to may  loans under the second lien term loan facility designated as base rate loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to i the greater of the overnight federal funds rate plus and the administrative agent s announced base rate  plus ii 
loans designated as libo rate loans bear interest at libor plus 
senior notes 
we issued million of our senior notes in december which bore interest at per year and were due to mature on december  in october  we issued million in senior notes due october at a price of of par 
concurrently with the sale of the senior notes  we irrevocably deposited million in cash with the trustee under the indenture governing the secured senior notes  thus effecting a satisfaction and discharge of the senior notes 
additionally  we issued an irrevocable notice of redemption to call the senior notes for redemption at on december  accordingly  the senior notes were fully repaid on december  along with all accrued interest as of the redemption date 
we may redeem the senior notes prior to october  at a make whole price defined in the indenture 
beginning october   we may redeem the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount and declining to by october  the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations 
the indenture governing the notes contains operational covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make investments  incur additional indebtedness or create liens on our assets 
because we must dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of amounts due under our debt agreements  that portion of our cash flow is not available for other purposes 
our ability to make scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and pursue our capital expenditure plan will depend to a significant extent on our financial and operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions  commodity prices and a variety of other factors 
if our cash flow and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and our capital expenditure budget  we may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled capital projects  sell material assets or operations and or seek additional capital 
needed capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness and certain other means is limited by covenants in our debt agreements 
in addition  pursuant to mandatory prepayment provisions in our credit facilities  our ability to respond to a shortfall in our expected liquidity by selling assets or incurring additional indebtedness would be limited by provisions in the facilities that require us to use some or all of the proceeds of such transactions to reduce amounts outstanding under one or both of the facilities in some circumstances 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed and on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete acquisitions that 
table of contents may be favorable to us  meet our debt obligations or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 
commitments and contingencies as of december   the aggregate amounts of contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years were as follows in thousands less than one year to years to years after years total long term debt interest on senior notes rental of office space total total contractually obligated payment commitments do not include the anticipated settlement of derivative contracts  obligations to taxing authorities or amounts relating to our asset retirement obligations  which include plugging and abandonment obligations  due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement amounts and timing of these obligations 
our total asset retirement obligations were million at december  amounts related to interest expense on our revolving credit facility and second lien term loan facility are not included in the table above because the interest rates on those debt instruments are variable 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred interest expense on those debt instruments of million  million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec rules  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and natural gas revenues  oil and natural gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents reserve estimates our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on the likelihood of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value and the rate of depletion of the oil and natural gas properties 
for example  oil and natural gas price changes affect the estimated economic lives of oil and natural gas properties and therefore cause reserve revisions 
our december  estimate of net proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled mmboe 
had oil and natural gas prices been lower as of the date of the estimate  our total oil and natural gas reserves would have been approximately lower 
in addition  our proved reserves are concentrated in a relatively small number of wells 
at december   of our proved reserves were concentrated in our largest wells 
as a result  any changes in proved reserves attributable to such individual wells could have a significant effect on our total reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
effective december   the sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb revised guidance regarding oil and gas reserves 
the significant revisions involve revised definitions of oil and gas producing activities and changing the pricing used to estimate reserves at period end to a twelve month arithmetic average of the first of the month prices from a period end price 
in accordance with this revised guidance  our reserves at december  have been prepared using the twelve month arithmetic average of the first of the month prices 
oil and natural gas properties  depletion and full cost ceiling test we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and exploitation and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include costs associated with lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and natural gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are generally accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  including estimated future development and capitalized asset retirement costs  is provided for using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets  with the amortization being expensed as depletion in the period that the reserves are produced 
this depletion expense is calculated by dividing the period s production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future development costs associated with the investment 
changes in our 
table of contents reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our depletion expense per unit 
for example  a reduction in our estimated reserves as of december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately per boe in our average depletion expense rate 
we calculated fourth quarter depletion expense based on the year end reserve report 
therefore  the reserves used to calculate the fourth quarter of depletion expense are determined on a different basis than the reserves used for the first three quarters of due to the change to pricing applied to year end reserves pursuant to the revised sec and fasb oil and gas reserves guidance 
the prices used to determine the reserves at december  are based on the unescalated twelve month arithmetic average of the prices in effect on the first of the month  whereas the prior quarters were based on the price in effect at the end of the period 
the impact of the change in pricing methodology is immaterial 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and natural gas properties 
unproved property costs not subject to amortization consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas 
costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves established or impairment determined 
we will continue to evaluate these properties and costs will be transferred into the amortization base as undeveloped areas are tested 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed  at least annually  for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis to determine whether we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven  either to have economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist 
under full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  excluding costs associated with unproved properties  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
effective for all annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after december   application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated twelve month arithmetic average of the prices in effect on the first day of each month of the relevant period and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded 
we did not have a ceiling test write down during at december   our net capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling by million  net of income tax effects  and we recorded a write down of our oil and natural gas properties in that amount 
per the guidance in effect at the time  the year end prices were used to determine reserves at december  we could be required to recognize additional impairments of oil and gas properties in future periods if market prices of oil and natural gas decline 
asset retirement obligations the accounting standards set forth by the fasb with respect to accounting for asset retirement obligations provide that  if the fair value for asset retirement obligations can be reasonably estimated  the liability should be recognized in the period when it is incurred 
oil and natural gas producing companies incur this liability upon acquiring or drilling a well 
under this method  the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value at the asset s inception  with the offsetting charge to property cost 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded in the income statement 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable laws 
we have determined our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to each liability 
the discount rates used to calculate the present value varied depending on the estimated timing of the relevant obligation  but typically ranged between and 
we periodically review the estimate of costs to plug  abandon and remediate our properties at the end of their productive lives 
this includes a review of both the estimated costs and the expected timing to incur such costs 
we believe most of these costs 
table of contents can be estimated with reasonable certainty based upon existing laws and regulatory requirements and based upon wells and facilities currently in place 
any changes in regulatory requirements  which changes cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  could result in material changes in such costs 
changes in reserve estimates and the economic life of oil and natural gas properties could affect the timing of such costs and accordingly the present value of such costs 
income tax expense income taxes reflect the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying current tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we have recognized a valuation allowance against our net deferred taxes because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of estimates of our future operating income based on current oil and natural gas commodity pricing 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  available taxes in carryback periods  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we will continue to evaluate whether the valuation allowance is needed in future reporting periods 
derivative instruments we reflect the fair market value of our derivative instruments on our balance sheet 
our estimates of fair value are determined by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as utilizing a black scholes option valuation model that is based upon underlying forward price curve data  risk free interest rates  credit adjusted discount rates and estimated volatility factors 
changes in commodity prices will result in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity swap agreements  and in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity collars to the extent the changes are outside the floor or cap of our collars 
we do not apply hedge accounting to any of our derivative contracts  therefore we recognize mark to market gains and losses in earnings currently 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the sec published revised rules regarding oil and gas reserves reporting requirements 
the objective of the rules is to provide readers of financial statements with more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
key elements of the revised rules include a change in the pricing used to estimate reserves at period end  certain revised definitions  optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves  allowance of the use of new technologies in the determination of reserves and additional disclosure requirements 
the rules also revise the prices used for reserves in determining depletion and the full cost ceiling test from a period end price to a twelve month arithmetic average price 
the revised rules are effective for annual reporting periods for fiscal years ending on or after december  application of the revised rules has resulted in changes to the prices used to determine proved reserves at december   as well as additional disclosures 
in january  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu to amend existing oil and gas reserve accounting and disclosure guidance to align its requirements with the sec s revised rules discussed above 
the significant revisions involve revised definitions of oil and gas producing 
table of contents activities  changing the pricing used to estimate reserves at period end to a twelve month arithmetic average and additional disclosure requirements 
in contrast to the sec rule  the fasb does not permit the disclosure of probable and possible reserves in the supplemental oil and gas information in the notes to the financial statements 
the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods ending on or after december  application of the revised rules is prospective and companies are not required to change prior period presentation to conform to the amendments 
application of the amended guidance has resulted in changes to the prices used to determine proved reserves at december   which did not result in a significant change to our oil and natural gas reserves 
pv the pre tax present value of future net cash flows  or pv  is a non gaap measure because it excludes income tax effects 
management believes that pre tax cash flow amounts are useful for evaluative purposes since future income taxes  which are affected by a company s unique tax position and strategies  can make after tax amounts less comparable 
we derive pv based on the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves  net of estimated production and future development costs and future plugging and abandonment costs  using the twelve month arithmetic average of the first of the month prices except that for periods prior to december   the period end price was used  without giving effect to hedging activities or future escalation  costs as of the date of estimate without future escalation  non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service and depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment and income taxes  and discounted using an annual discount rate of 
the following table reconciles the standardized measure of future net cash flows to pv as of the dates shown in thousands december  standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at pv based on unescalated year end posted prices of i per bbl for oil and natural gas liquids  and adjusted for quality  transportation fees and regional price differentials and ii per mmbtu for natural gas  and adjusted for energy content  transportation fees and regional price differentials

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this section provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage commodity price volatility 
due to the historical volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices  we have implemented a hedging strategy aimed at reducing the variability of the prices we receive for our production and providing a minimum revenue stream 
currently  we purchase puts and enter into other derivative transactions such as collars and fixed price swaps in order to hedge our exposure to changes 
table of contents in commodity prices 
all contracts are settled with cash and do not require the delivery of a physical quantity to satisfy settlement 
while this hedging strategy may result in us having lower revenues than we would have if we were unhedged in times of higher oil and natural gas prices  management believes that the stabilization of prices and protection afforded us by providing a revenue floor on a portion of our production is beneficial 
we may  from time to time  opportunistically restructure existing derivative contracts or enter into new transactions to effectively modify the terms of current contracts in order to improve the pricing parameters in existing contracts or realize the current value of our existing positions and use the proceeds from such transactions to secure additional contracts for periods in which we believe there is additional unmitigated commodity price risk 
this section also provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage interest rate risk

this call spread was previously paired with our calendar natural gas collar  creating a net collar on  mmbtu d

most of our derivative contracts relate to changes in the market price relative to the applicable benchmark price  basis swap contracts relate to changes in the applicable differential 
the objective of our hedging activities and the use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows 
our hedging activities seek to mitigate our exposure to price declines and allow us more flexibility to continue to execute our capital expenditure plan even if prices decline 
our collar and swap contracts  however  prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement 
also  if production is less than the amount we have hedged and the price of oil or natural gas exceeds a fixed price in a hedge contract  we will be required to make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production 
this could impact our liquidity and our ability to fund future capital expenditures 
if we were unable to satisfy such a payment obligation  that default could result in a cross default under our revolving credit agreement 
in addition  we have incurred  and may incur in the future  substantial unrealized commodity derivative losses in connection with our hedging activities  although we do not expect such losses to have a material effect on our liquidity or our ability to fund expected capital expenditures 
in addition  the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
we generally have netting 
table of contents arrangements with our counterparties that provide for the offset of payables against receivables from separate derivative arrangements with that counterparty in the event of contract termination 
the derivative contracts may be terminated by a non defaulting party in the event of default by one of the parties to the agreement 
all of the counterparties to our derivative contracts are also lenders  or affiliates of lenders  under our revolving credit facility 
therefore  we are not required to post collateral when we are in a derivative liability position 
our revolving credit facility and our derivative contracts contain provisions that provide for cross defaults and acceleration of those debt and derivative instruments in certain situations 
lehman brothers commodity services  inc lbcs was a counterparty to several derivative contracts with us entered into between august and may in september  lehman brothers holdings inc lbh  credit support provider for lbcs  filed for bankruptcy 
the bankruptcy filing of lbh constituted an event of default under the isda master agreement between us and lbcs 
accordingly  we notified lbcs that we were terminating each of the outstanding transactions  effective immediately 
subsequent to our notification of termination  lbcs filed for bankruptcy protection 
similar issues could affect other hedge counterparties in the future 
because a large portion of our commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and to increase clarity in our financial statements  we elected to discontinue hedge accounting effective april  consequently  from that date forward  we have recognized mark to market gains and losses in earnings currently  rather than deferring such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income for those commodity derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on the difference between the fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in commodity derivative gains losses on the consolidated statement of operations 
as of december   the fair value of our commodity derivatives was a net asset of million 
interest rate derivative transactions we are subject to interest rate risk with respect to amounts borrowed under our credit facilities because those amounts bear interest at variable rates 
as of february   there was approximately million outstanding under those facilities 
we entered into an interest rate swap transaction to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to million of variable rate borrowings through september whereby we paid a fixed interest rate of and received a floating interest rate based on the three month libo rate 
in connection with the extension of the maturity on our second lien term loan facility to may  we entered into a revised interest rate swap agreement in october to extend the terms of the existing interest rate swap agreement from september to may and reduce the rate from to a weighted average rate of 
as a result  million of our variable rate debt will effectively bear interest at a fixed rate of approximately until may accordingly  we expect to be subject to interest rate risk until that time only with respect to variable rate borrowings in excess of million 
as of february   there was approximately million borrowed in excess of the aforementioned million 
a increase in interest rates on unhedged variable rate borrowings of million at december  would result in additional annualized interest expense of million 
as of december   the fair value of our interest rate derivatives was a liability of million
