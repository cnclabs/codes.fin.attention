item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying financial statements and the notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
some of our discussion is forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties 
for information regarding factors that could have a material adverse effect on our business  refer to risk factors under the description of business section above 
overview zion oil is an initial stage oil and gas exploration company with a history of almost ten years of oil and gas exploration in israel 
we have no revenues or operating income and we are classified as an exploration stage company 
the company currently holds two petroleum exploration licenses  named the joseph license and the asher menashe license  and one preliminary exclusive petroleum exploration permit named the issachar zebulun permit 
in total  zion s total petroleum exploration areas is approximately  acres 
the joseph license and asher menashe license areas  as well as the issachar zebulun permit area  are contiguous in a similar geologic environment 
they are located on a continuous regional high associated with the basement to a paleozoic age structure approximately million years old that runs parallel to the current coast of israel primarily onshore from just off of haifa to south of tel aviv 
the regional high is evidenced by gravimetric anomalies in both license areas 
this structure and other geologic elements common to both areas  including particularly the triassic age approximately million years ago ma anit structure that extends from the joseph license area into the asher menashe license area  lend themselves to an integrated exploratory program and  if successful  may lend themselves to an integrated development program 
to date  we have completed drilling two exploratory wells in the joseph license area and are in the process of drilling one exploratory well in the asher menashe license area 
the first exploratory well  named the ma anit well  was drilled to a depth of  feet  meters to the triassic formation with encouraging but inconclusive results 
however  notwithstanding these results  due to the mechanical condition of the well bore  we determined that the well was incapable of producing oil and or gas in commercial quantities and  consequently  in june we abandoned the well 
in  we drilled an additional well the ma anit rehoboth well  directionally to a depth of  feet  meters 
the purpose of the ma anit rehoboth well was both to appraise the apparent findings of the ma anit in the triassic at a depth of between approximately  and  feet and to test the deeper permian horizons at a depth of between approximately  and  feet 
the well penetrated a number of geologic formations that have been preliminarily deemed to have hydrocarbon potential and we retrieved a small quantity of crude oil 
at this stage  we are unsure as to whether we have made a discovery of any hydrocarbon reservoir or  if such a reservoir exists  whether it would be commercially viable 
in february  we began completions testing of the ma anit rehoboth well 
in october  utilizing the  horsepower drilling rig used to drill zion s ma anit rehoboth well  we commenced drilling an additional well the elijah well  within the asher menashe license area  toward the triassic geological formation  which is expected below approximately  feet  meters 
as of february   we drilled to a depth of  feet  meters 
in early february  we temporarily suspended drilling operations in the well following our unsuccessful efforts to retrieve a stuck pipe 
following the decision to temporarily suspend drilling operations at the elijah well  we transferred the rig to the ma anit rehoboth well to conduct testing procedures 
we intend to resume drilling activity in the elijah well at the earliest appropriate time following our determination of the desired course of action relating to this well 
as the ma anit rehoboth well did not reach the permian geological formation beneath the joseph license area  we are currently planning to drill a subsequent well  named by us the ma anit joseph well at a final location likely near the ma anit rehoboth well 
the drilling of the ma anit well is planned to test the permian geological formation 
we have started the permitting process and are in discussions with the owners of our current drilling rig to drill this future well 
principal components of our cost structure our operating and other expenses primarily consist of the following unsuccessful exploratory wells or dry holes impairment expense is recognized if a determination is made that a well will not be able to be commercially productive 
the amounts include amounts paid in respect of the drilling operations as well as geological and geophysical costs and various amounts that were paid to israeli regulatory authorities 
general and administrative expenses overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of managing our exploratory operations  audit and other professional fees  and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense also includes non cash stock based compensation expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to explore for natural gas and oil 
as a full cost company  we capitalize all costs associated with our exploration  and apportion these costs to each unit of production  if any  through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
as we have yet to have production  the costs of abandoned wells are written off immediately versus being included in this amortization pool 
recent financing activities in order to support our drilling operations  we have completed several public financings since october  all of which are discussed below 
we believe that are our currently available funds are sufficient to support the drilling of the ma anit joseph well 
to carry out further planned operations in and beyond  we will need to raise additional funds through either additional equity raises or private financing 
between october  and january   we raised from a follow on public offering gross proceeds of  from the sale of units of our securities  of which  was for debt conversion 
thereafter  in june  we raised gross proceeds of million from a rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering commenced on may   following the declaration of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the sec in respect of such offering 
under the rights offering  stockholders of record on the record date of may  of shares of the our common stock received  by way of a dividend  
of a subscription right for each share held as of such date three subscription rights for each eight shares 
each whole subscription right entitled the shareholder to purchase one share of common stock at the purchase price of per share 
the rights offering was fully subscribed  resulting in our distribution of all of the million shares that were offered 
in november  we raised an additional million from a follow on rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering commenced on october   following the declaration of the effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the sec in respect of the offering 
under the rights offering  stockholders of record on the record date of october  of shares of our common stock received  by way of a dividend  
of a subscription right for each share held as of such date twenty three subscription rights for each one hundred shares 
each whole subscription right entitled the shareholder to purchase one share of common stock at the purchase price of per share 
the rights offering was fully subscribed  resulting in our distribution of all of the million shares that were offered 
in order to support our operations and drilling program beyond fiscal year  on january   we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s for a shelf offering 
as of the filing of this annual report on form k  the registration statement has not been declared effective 
when declared effective by the sec  zion will have the option to offer and sell  from time to time in one or more offerings  up to million of common stock  debt securities  warrants to purchase any of these securities  or any combination of such securities 
the securities may be offered in one or more offerings  and at prices subject to prevailing market conditions to be set forth in a supplemental prospectus filing with the sec at the time of such offering  should such an offering occur 
we do not currently have any commitments to sell securities 
going concern basis our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
since we are in the development stage  we have limited capital resources  no revenue to date and a loss from operations 
the appropriateness of using the going concern basis is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financing or equity capital and  ultimately  to achieve profitable operations 
the uncertainty of these conditions in the past has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
we have identified the accounting principles which we believe are most critical to the reported financial status by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex of subjective decisions or assessment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized 
all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is included in income from continuing operations before income taxes and the adjusted carrying amount of the unproved properties is amortized on the unit of production method 
the company s oil and gas property represents an investment in unproved properties and two major development projects on that property 
these costs are excluded from the amortized cost pool until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is charged to expense since a reserve base has not yet been established 
a further impairment requiring a charge to expense may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information  but has not occurred since july abandonment of properties is accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs 
the net capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test which limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value of future net revenues from proved reserves discounted at ten percent based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized for oil and gas properties is dependent upon the identification of economically recoverable reserves  together with obtaining the necessary financing to exploit such reserves and the achievement of profitable operations 
in june  following the analysis of the results of the testing of the company s ma anit well workover and an evaluation of the mechanical condition of the well  the company determined that the well was incapable of producing oil and or gas in commercial quantities 
in order to optimize drilling operations on the company s planned ma anit rehoboth well  the company ceased operations on the ma anit well and  as required by the petroleum law  formally relinquished the ma anit joseph license 
as planned  the company used the ma anit wellbore  down to approximately  feet  meters  as the upper part of the wellbore for the ma anit rehoboth well 
this well was directionally drilled from that point to penetrate the middle and the lower triassic 
the company drilled this well to a depth of  feet  meters and  after initial testing of the lower open hole section of the well using a workover rig  in december  is preparing for further testing of the well in immediately after the relinquishment of the ma anit joseph license  the company filed an application with the petroleum commissioner for a petroleum exploration license  the joseph license  covering approximately  acres of the original ma anit joseph license including the ma anit structure on which the ma anit well was drilled  which license was subsequently granted on october  as a result of the abandonment of the ma anit well and formal relinquishment of the ma anit joseph license  the company recorded in june an impairment of  to its unproved oil and gas properties 
although both our properties and our principal operations are in israel  we report all our transactions in united states dollars 
certain of the dollar amounts in the financial statements may represent the dollar equivalent of other currencies 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that we believe  is likely to be realized in the future 
in assessing the need for the valuation allowance we have considered not only future taxable income but also feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
in the event that we were to determine that it would be likely that we would  in the future  realize our deferred tax assets in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made 
in the period that such a determination was made  the adjustment to the deferred tax asset would produce an increase in our net income 
we do not participate in  nor have we created  any off balance sheet special purpose entities or other off balance sheet financing 
in addition  we do not enter into any derivative financial instruments 
we record a liability for asset retirement obligation at fair value in the period in which it is incurred and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  revenue 
we have no revenue generating operations as we are still an exploration stage company 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   representing an increase of 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in compared to is primarily attributable to higher non cash salary expenses for recognition of compensation expense related to option grants and stock awards 
salary expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase in salary expenses during is attributable to  in non cash expenses related to  additional compensation expense this year over last year related to stock option grants and  related to stock grants and gifts 
the rest of the increase is due to the expansion of staff to support operations 
legal and professional fees for were  as compared to  for  representing a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in legal and professional fees is primarily attributable to the increased utilization of in house legal staff 
other general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the decrease in other general and administrative expenses during is primarily attributable to our continued efforts to control support costs 
interest income  net 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income  net is attributable to extremely lower rates being paid by the banks despite the higher average cash balances during net loss 
net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was  at december  and  at december  the increase in working capital is attributable to the two rights offerings completed in net cash provided by financing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which the increase was from the two rights offerings held during net cash used in investing activities was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  substantially all of which was used for exploratory drilling operations 
net cash used in operations was  for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december   including payments of deferred officer s salaries 
on march   we had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of until we begin generating substantial revenues  our ability to fund our drilling programs and operations is dependent on our ability to raise funds through public or private placement of our securities or attracting other parties to join our drilling efforts 
as noted previously  between october  and december   the company raised gross proceeds in the follow on public offering of  including  debt conversion 
after deducting for commissions and expenses to the underwriter in the amount of  and the deduction of  in deferred offering costs related to legal  accounting  transfer agent and escrow fees and printing and marketing costs  the company received net proceeds of  in the follow on public offering through december  in january  the company raised an additional  including  debt conversion and approximately  in settlement of fees due to two service providers 
total gross proceeds raised in the follow on public offering were  including  of debt conversions made by two senior officers directors of deferred amounts due to them and approximately  payments of fees to service providers 
the company issued  in respect of the total amounts raised   units of our securities  for cash and  for debt conversions and payments of fees to service providers 
in june  we raised gross proceeds of million from a rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was fully subscribed  resulting in our distribution of all of the million shares that were offered 
thereafter  in november  we raised an additional million from a follow on rights offering to common stockholders of up to million shares of our common stock 
the rights offering was fully subscribed  resulting in our distribution of all of the million shares that were offered 
we believe that our currently available cash resources will be sufficient to enable us to meet our needs in carrying out our plans through the end of fiscal  including drilling the planned ma anit joseph well 
we will need to raise additional funds to maintain operations beyond such point by attracting additional investments in our company or additional parties to join our drilling operations 
we have no commitments for any such financing or participation and no assurance can be provided that we will be successful in attracting any such investment 
in order to afford ourselves financing flexibility  in january  we filed with the sec a universal shelf registration statement 
as of the date of the filing of this report on form k  the registration statement has not been declared effective 
following effectiveness of the registration statement  we have the option to offer and sell  from time to time in one or more offerings  up to million of common stock  debt securities  warrants to purchase any of these securities  or any combination of such securities 
the securities may be offered in one or more offerings  and at prices subject to prevailing market conditions to be set forth in a supplemental prospectus filing with the sec at the time of such offering  should such an offering occur 
at present  however  we do not have any commitments to sell securities 
proceeds from any such offering  if any  will be used for our operations  including our multi well drilling program 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the sec published authoritative guidance as the final rule modernization of oil and gas reporting and in january  the fasb issued a pronouncement in order to align the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of extractive activities oil and gas topic with the requirements in the sec s final rule 
the new guidance permits the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes 
the new requirements also will allow companies to disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors 
in addition  the new disclosure requirements require companies to  among other things a report the independence and qualifications of its reserves preparer or auditor  b file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserves estimates or conducts a reserves audit  and c report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than period end prices 
the use of the new proved reserve definitions and average prices in developing the company s reserve estimates will affect future impairment and depletion calculations 
the new disclosure requirements are effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december  a company may not apply the new rules to disclosures in quarterly reports prior to the first annual report in which the revised disclosures are required 
as we do not yet have proved reserves  the adoption of this final rule has had no material effect on our disclosures  financial position or results of operations
