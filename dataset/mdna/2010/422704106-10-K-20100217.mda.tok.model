products and segments our segments are differentiated by geographic region and principal products produced 
we produce zinc  lead and bulk concentrates at our greens creek unit and lead and zinc concentrates at our lucky friday unit  which we sell to custom smelters on contract  and unrefined gold bullion bars dor at greens creek  which are sold directly to customers or further refined before sale to precious metals traders 
the concentrates produced at our greens creek and lucky friday units contain silver  zinc and lead  and the concentrates produced at greens creek also contain gold 
our segments as of december  included the greens creek unit  a joint venture arrangement which is owned by us through our subsidiaries hecla alaska llc  hecla greens creek mining company and hecla juneau mining company 
we acquired of our ownership of greens creek in april from indirect subsidiaries of rio tinto  plc

the collective bargaining agreement with workers at our lucky friday unit expires on april  we anticipate that we will reach a satisfactory contract with the union  although there can be no assurance that this can be done or that it can be done without disruptions to production 
during the past five years  labor strikes and work slow downs adversely affected our production in mexico and at our now divested venezuelan operations

item a 
risk factors the following risks and uncertainties  together with the other information set forth in this form k  should be carefully considered by those who invest in our securities 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results and could decrease the value of our common and or preferred stock 

table of contents financial risks the global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the continued credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system has had and may continue to have an impact on our business and financial position 
the financial crisis may limit our ability to raise capital through credit and equity markets 
as discussed further below  the prices of the metals that we produce are affected by a number of factors  and it is unknown how these factors may be impacted by a continuation of the financial crisis 
we have had losses that could reoccur in the future 
although we reported net income for the years ended december  and of million and million  respectively  we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million 
a comparison of operating results over the past three years can be found in results of operations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
many of the factors affecting our operating results are beyond our control  including the volatility of metals prices  smelter terms  diesel fuel prices  interest rates  global or regional political or economic policies  inflation  developments and crises  governmental regulations  continuity of orebodies  and speculation and sales by central banks and other holders and producers of gold and silver in response to these factors 
we cannot foresee whether our operations will continue to generate sufficient revenue in order for us to generate net cash from operating activities 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience net losses in the future 
commodity hedging activities could expose us to losses 
we periodically enter into hedging activities  such as forward sales contracts and commodity put and call option contracts  to manage the prices received on the metals we produce 
such hedging activities are utilized to attempt to insulate our operating results from declines in prices for those metals 
however  hedging may prevent us from realizing possible revenues in the event that the market price of a metal exceeds the price stated in a forward sale or call option contract 
in addition  we may experience losses if a counterparty fails to purchase under a contract when the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity 
at december   we had no commodity hedging contracts 
our profitability could be affected by the prices of other commodities 
our business activities are highly dependent on the costs of commodities such as fuel  steel and cement 
the recent prices for such commodities have been volatile and may increase our costs of production and development 
a material increase in costs at any of our operating properties could have a significant effect on our profitability 
for additional discussion  see results of operations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting and other estimates may be imprecise 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to mineral reserves that are the basis for future cash flow estimates and units of production depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations  future metals prices  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments  reserves for contingencies and litigation  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
for additional information  see critical accounting estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  note significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated  our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise and our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 

table of contents a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc and  as a result  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
silver  gold  lead and zinc prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors  including speculative activities  relative exchange rates of the us dollar  global and regional demand and production  recession or reduced economic activity  and other political and economic conditions 
these factors are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
if the market prices for these metals fall below our production or development costs for a sustained period of time  we will experience losses and may have to discontinue exploration  development or operations  or incur asset write downs at one or more of our properties 
the following table sets forth the average daily closing prices of the following metals for the year ended december   and each year thereafter through silver per oz 
gold per oz 
lead per lb 
zinc per lb 
london fix london final london metals exchange cash london metals exchange special high grade cash on february   the closing prices for silver  gold  lead and zinc were per ounce   per ounce  per pound and per pound  respectively 
an extended decline in metals prices or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves may cause us to record write downs  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we review the recoverability of the cost of our long lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairment  measured by comparing an asset s carrying value to its fair value  must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows  and recognizing impairment write downs could negatively impact our results of operations 
metal price estimates are a key component used in the analysis of the carrying values of our assets 
we evaluated the december  carrying values of long lived assets at our greens creek and lucky friday segments by comparing them to the average estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from operating plans using various metals price scenarios 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows for each of our properties also include an estimation of the market value of the exploration potential beyond the current operating plans 
because the average estimated undiscounted cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values  we did not record impairments as of december  however  if the prices of silver  gold  zinc and lead decline for an extended period of time or we fail to control production costs or realize the mineable ore reserves or exploration potential at our mining properties  we may be required to recognize asset write downs in the future 
in addition  the perceived market value of the exploration potential of our properties is dependent upon prevailing metals prices as well as our ability to discover economic ore 
a decline in metals prices for an extended period of time or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves could significantly reduce our estimations of the value of the exploration potential at our properties and result in asset write downs 

table of contents our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income we recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets 
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction 
metal price estimates are a key component used in the determination of our ability to realize the expected future benefit of our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that future taxable income differs significantly from estimates as a result of a decline in metals prices or other factors  our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted 
additionally  future issuances of common stock or common stock equivalents could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
future changes in tax law or changes in ownership structure could limit our ability to obtain future tax benefits 
as of december   our current and non current deferred tax asset balances were million and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our deferred tax assets 
returns for investments in pension plans and pension plan funding requirements are uncertain we maintain pension plans for employees  which provide for specified payments after retirement for certain employees 
the ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans 
returns  if any  on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions 
a sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated 
operation  development  exploration and acquisition risks we may be subject to a number of unanticipated risks related to inadequate infrastructure 
mining  processing  development and exploration activities depend on adequate infrastructure 
reliable roads  bridges  power sources and water supply are important determinants  which affect capital and operating costs 
unusual or infrequent weather phenomena  sabotage  government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could adversely affect our mining operations 
our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated 
capitalized development projects may cost more and provide less return than we estimate 
if we are unable to realize a return on these investments  we may incur a related asset write down that could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
our ability to sustain or increase our current level of production of metals partly depends on our ability to develop new orebodies and or expand existing mining operations 
before we can begin a development project  we must first determine whether it is economically feasible to do so 
this determination is based on estimates of several factors  including ore reserves  expected recovery rates of metals from the ore  future metals prices  facility and equipment costs  availability of affordable sources of power and adequacy of water supply  exploration and drilling success  capital and operating costs of a development project  environmental considerations and permitting  adequate access to the site  including competing land uses such as agriculture  applicable tax rates  
table of contents assumptions used in determining the value of our pension plan assets and liabilities  foreign currency fluctuation and inflation rates  and availability of financing 
these estimates are based on geological and other interpretive data  which may be imprecise 
as a result  actual operating and capital costs and returns from a development project may differ substantially from our estimates as a result of which it may not be economically feasible to continue with a development project 
our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise 
our ore reserve figures and costs are primarily estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of these metals 
you are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on estimates of reserves 
reserves are estimates made by our professional technical personnel  and no assurance can be given that the estimated amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
reserve estimation is an interpretive process based upon available data and various assumptions 
our reserve estimates may change based on actual production experience 
further  reserves are valued based on estimates of costs and metals prices  which may not be consistent among our operating and non operating properties 
the economic value of ore reserves may be adversely affected by declines in the market price of the various metals we mine  increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit  increase in the dilution of the ore  and reduced recovery rates 
short term operating factors relating to our ore reserves  such as the need to sequentially develop orebodies and the processing of new or different ore grades  may adversely affect our cash flow 
we may use forward sales contracts and other hedging techniques to partially offset the effects of a drop in the market prices of the metals we mine 
however  if the prices of metals that we produce decline substantially below the levels used to calculate reserves for an extended period  we could experience delays in new project development  net losses  reduced cash flow  reductions in reserves  and write downs of asset values 
efforts to expand the finite lives of our mines may not be successful or could result in significant demands on our liquidity  which could hinder our growth and decrease the value of our stock 
one of the risks we face is that our mines have a relatively small amount of proven and probable reserves  primarily because we have low volume  underground operations 
thus  we must continually replace depleted ore reserves 
our ability to expand or replace ore reserves primarily depends on the success of our exploration programs 
mineral exploration  particularly for silver and gold  is highly speculative and expensive 
it involves many risks and is often non productive 
even if we believe we have found a valuable mineral deposit  it may be several years before production from that deposit is possible 
during that time  it may become no longer feasible to produce those minerals for economic  regulatory  political or other reasons 
as a result of high costs and other uncertainties  we may not be able to expand or replace our existing ore reserves as they are depleted  which would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
over the past years we have evaluated alternatives for deeper access at the lucky friday mine in order to expand its operational life 
as a result  we have initiated engineering  procurement of long lead time equipment  development  and other early stage activities relating to construction of an internal shaft at lucky friday 
upon completion  the internal shaft would allow us to mine mineralized material below our current workings and provide deeper platforms for exploration 
construction of the internal shaft would take approximately five years and involve significant capital expenditures 
should we decide to continue with construction of the internal shaft  our ability to fund this project  along with our other capital requirements  would depend to a large extent on our operating performance 
a significant decrease in metals prices  an increase in operating costs or an increase in the capital cost could potentially require us to suspend the project or access additional capital though debt financing  the sale of securities  or other external sources 
this additional financing could be costly or unavailable 

table of contents our joint development and operating arrangements may not be successful 
we have entered into  and may in the future enter into joint venture arrangements in order to share the risks and costs of developing and operating properties 
in a typical joint venture arrangement  the partners own a proportionate share of the assets  are entitled to indemnification from each other and are only responsible for any future liabilities in proportion to their interest in the joint venture 
if a party fails to perform its obligations under a joint venture agreement  we could incur liabilities and losses in excess of our pro rata share of the joint venture 
we make investments in exploration and development projects that may have to be written off in the event we do not proceed to a commercially viable mining operation 
on february   we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary  rio grande silver inc  acquired the right to earn into a joint venture interest in an approximately square mile consolidated land package in the creede mining district of colorado 
for more information on the terms of the agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our ability to market our metals production may be affected by disruptions or closures of custom smelters and or refining facilities 
we sell substantially all of our metallic concentrates to custom smelters  with our dor bars sent to refiners for further processing before being sold to metal traders 
if our ability to sell concentrates to our contracted smelters becomes unavailable to us  it is possible our operations could be adversely affected 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the distribution of our sales and our significant customers 
we face inherent risks in acquisitions of other mining companies or properties that may adversely impact our growth strategy 
mines have limited lives  which is an inherent risk in acquiring mining properties 
we are actively seeking to expand our mineral reserves by acquiring other mining companies or properties 
although we are pursuing opportunities that we feel are in the best interest of our investors  these pursuits are costly and often unproductive 
inherent risks in acquisitions we may undertake in the future could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available in the united states and foreign countries where we would consider conducting exploration and or production activities  and any acquisition we may undertake is subject to inherent risks 
in addition to the risk associated with limited mine lives  we may not realize the value of the companies or properties that are acquired due to a possible decline in metals prices  failure to obtain permits  labor problems  changes in regulatory environment  failure to achieve anticipated synergies  an inability to obtain financing and other factors previously described 
acquisitions of other mining companies or properties may also expose us to new geographic  political  operating  and geological risks 
in addition  we face strong competition for companies and properties from other mining companies  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  and we may be unable to acquire attractive companies and mining properties on terms that we consider acceptable 
our business depends on good relations with our employees 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of our executive officers  managers  employees and other personnel  including those residing outside of the us  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of such employees 
we compete with other companies both within and outside the mining industry in connection with the recruiting and retention of qualified employees knowledgeable of the mining business 
the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
our labor contract with our employees at our lucky friday unit expires on april  although we intend to negotiate a new agreement on a timely basis  there can be no assurance that we will do so or that the terms of any new agreement will be favorable to us 
mining accidents or other adverse events at an operation could decrease our anticipated production 
production may be reduced below our historical or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents  unfavorable ground conditions  work stoppages or slow downs  lower than expected ore grades  the metallurgical characteristics of the ore that are less economic than anticipated  or our equipment or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected 

table of contents our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards including environmental hazards  political and country risks  civil unrest or terrorism  industrial accidents  labor disputes or strikes  unusual or unexpected geologic formations  cave ins  explosive rock failures  and unanticipated hydrologic conditions  including flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
such risks could result in personal injury or fatalities  damage to or destruction of mineral properties or producing facilities  environmental damage  delays in exploration  development or mining  monetary losses  and legal liability 
we maintain insurance to protect against losses that may result from some of these risks at levels consistent with our historical experience  industry practice and circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
insurance against environmental risks is generally either unavailable or  we believe  too expensive for us  and we therefore do not maintain environmental insurance 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may have an adverse effect on our business 
our foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks 
we sold our mining operations and assets in venezuela in july  but still currently conduct exploration projects in mexico and continue to own assets  real estate and mineral interests there 
we anticipate that we will continue to conduct operations in mexico and possibly other international locations in the future 
because we conduct operations internationally  we are subject to political and economic risks such as the effects of local political  labor and economic developments and unrest  significant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate  exchange controls and export restrictions  expropriation or nationalization of assets with inadequate compensation  currency fluctuations and repatriation restrictions  invalidation of governmental orders  permits or agreements  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits and contracts  corruption  demands for improper payments  expropriation  and uncertain legal enforcement and physical security  disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to us laws and regulations  fuel or other commodity shortages  illegal mining  
table of contents laws or policies of foreign countries and the united states affecting trade  investment and taxation  civil disturbances  war and terrorist actions  and seizures of assets 
consequently  our exploration  development and production activities outside of the united states may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control  any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
legal  market and regulatory risks we are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us 
there are several ongoing legal disputes in which we are involved 
if any of these disputes results in a substantial monetary judgment against us  is settled on unfavorable terms or otherwise impacts our operations  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
for example  we may ultimately incur environmental remediation costs or the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings may be awarded damages substantially in excess of the amounts we have accrued 
for a description of the lawsuits in which we are involved  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are required to obtain governmental and lessor approvals and permits in order to conduct mining operations 
in the ordinary course of business  mining companies are required to seek governmental and lessor approvals and permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations 
obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex  time consuming and costly process 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control 
obtaining environmental permits  including the approval of reclamation plans  may increase costs and cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
there can be no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained and  if obtained  that the costs involved will not exceed those that we previously estimated 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would not proceed with the development or operation 
we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
our business is subject to extensive us and foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing development  production  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  use of toxic substances  environmental regulations  mine safety and other matters 
see risk titled our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
we have been and are currently involved in lawsuits or disputes in which we have been accused of causing environmental damage  violating environmental laws  or violating environmental permits  and we may be subject to similar lawsuits or disputes in the future 
new legislation and regulations may be adopted or permit limits reduced at any time that result in additional operating expense  capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the mining  production or development of our properties 
legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and green house gas emissions are in various phases of consideration 
if adopted  such measures could increase our cost of environmental compliance and also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities 
proposed measures could also result in increased cost of fuel and other consumables used at our operations  including the diesel generation of electricity at our greens creek operation if we are unable to access utility power 
climate change legislation may also affect our smelter customers who burn fossil fuels  resulting in increased costs to us  and may affect the market for the metals we produce with effects on prices that are not possible for us to predict 
in late and during  we experienced a number of water permit exceedances for water discharges at our lucky friday unit 
in april  we entered into a consent agreement and final order cafo and a compliance order with the epa  which included an extended compliance timeline 
in connection with the cafo  we agreed to pay an administrative penalty to the epa of  to settle any liability for such exceedances 
we are undertaking efforts that we believe will be successful in bringing our water discharges at the lucky friday unit into compliance with the permit  but cannot provide assurances that we will be able to fully comply with the permit limits  particularly in the near future 
any future non compliance with the permit limits or other regulatory or environmental requirements could lead to future penalties  regulatory or other legal action  damages  or otherwise impact our operations and financial results 
from time to time  the us congress considers proposed amendments to the general mining law of  as amended  which governs mining claims and related activities on federal lands 
the extent of any future changes is not known and the potential impact on us as a result of us congressional action is difficult to predict 
changes to the general mining law  if adopted  could adversely affect our ability to economically develop mineral reserves on federal lands 

table of contents our environmental remediation obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
we are subject to significant environmental obligations  particularly in northern idaho 
at december   we had accrued million as a provision for environmental remediation  million of which relates to our various liabilities in idaho  and there is a significant risk that the costs of remediation could materially exceed this provision 
for an overview of our potential environmental liabilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the titles to some of our properties may be defective or challenged 
unpatented mining claims constitute a significant portion of our undeveloped property holdings  the validity of which could be uncertain and may be contested 
although we have conducted title reviews of our property holdings  title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title 
in accordance with mining industry practice  we do not generally obtain title opinions until we decide to develop a property 
therefore  while we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our undeveloped properties  some titles may be defective 
the price of our stock has a history of volatility and could decline in the future 
our common and preferred stocks are listed on the new york stock exchange 
the market price for our stock has been volatile  often based on changes in metals prices  particularly silver  our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our public news releases or periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission  fluctuating proven and probable reserves  factors unrelated to our financial performance or future prospects  such as global economic developments and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries  political and regulatory risk  the success of our exploration programs  ability to meet production estimates  environmental and legal risk  the extent of analytical coverage concerning our business  and the trading volume and general market interest in our securities 
the market price of our stock at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our long term value  and may prevent shareholders from realizing a profit on their investment 
our series b preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share or million 
if we were liquidated  holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately million plus any accrued and unpaid dividends from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds 
our series b preferred stock ranks on parity with our mandatory convertible preferred stock 
our mandatory convertible preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share or million 
if we were liquidated  holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately million plus any accrued and unpaid dividends from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds 
our mandatory convertible preferred stock ranks on parity with our series b preferred stock 
we may not be able to pay preferred stock dividends in the future 
since july  we paid regular quarterly dividends on our series b preferred stock through the third quarter of the annual dividend payable on the series b preferred stock is currently million 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not declared preferred dividends on series b preferred stock since the second quarter of in december  we issued mandatory convertible preferred stock with an annual dividend of million  each of which quarterly dividend payments have been made through the third quarter of series b preferred stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock dividends due on january   for the fourth quarter of and dividends due for the three quarters thereafter were deferred 
in january we paid all dividends in arrears and dividends due for the fourth quarter of for the series b and mandatory convertible preferred stock 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future 

table of contents additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could reduce our earnings per share 
we may issue equity in the future in connection with acquisitions  strategic transactions or for other purposes 
any such acquisition could be material to us and could significantly increase the size and scope of our business  including our market capitalization 
we may also be required to issue common stock upon the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and may pay dividends on our mandatory convertible preferred stock in shares of our common stock 
to the extent we issue any additional equity securities  the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced 
as of december  there were warrants outstanding for purchase of  shares of our common stock 
the warrants give the holders the right to purchase our common stock at the following prices  shares   shares   shares  and 
warrants to purchase  shares at per share expire in june  while the remaining warrants expire in june and august see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the issuance of additional shares of our preferred stock or common stock in the future could adversely affect holders of common stock 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our preferred stock 
for example  the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by investors anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock received upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock or as dividends thereon  and our failure to pay dividends on our currently outstanding series b preferred stock or mandatory convertible preferred stock  which would prevent us from paying dividends to holders of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
this includes the power to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights and preferences over common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the business and other terms 
if we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected 
as noted above  as of december   there were warrants outstanding to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
we may issue substantial additional shares of common stock or other securities in connection with acquisition transactions or for other purposes  to the extent permitted by our credit facility 
any such acquisition could be material to us and could significantly increase the size and scope of our business 
issuances or sales of substantial amounts of additional common stock or the perception that such issuances or sales could occur may cause prevailing market prices for our common stock to decline and could result in dilution to our stockholders

in addition  shares of our common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions 
we may issue substantial additional shares of common stock or other securities in connection with material acquisition transactions 
the market price of our common stock could decline if certain large holders of our common stock  or recipients of our common stock in connection with an acquisition  sell all or a significant portion of their shares of common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner 
in addition  these sales could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock in the capital markets 

table of contents the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer a premium for our common stock 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that transaction would be beneficial to stockholders 
these impediments include the classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  which makes it more difficult to quickly replace board members  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval  a provision that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors  a provision that special meetings of stockholders may only be called pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of our entire board of directors  a prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders  a provision that our board members may only be removed for cause and by an affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding voting stock  a provision that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders  a prohibition against certain business combinations with an acquirer of or more of our common stock for three years after such acquisition unless the stock acquisition or the business combination is approved by our board prior to the acquisition of the interest  or after such acquisition our board and the holders of two thirds of the other common stock approve the business combination  and a prohibition against our entering into certain business combinations with interested stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock 
the existence of these provisions may deprive stockholders of an opportunity to sell our stock at a premium over prevailing prices 
the potential inability of our stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for our common stock

if we are unable to satisfy the nyse criteria for continued listing  our common stock would be subject to delisting 
a delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by  among other things  reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock  reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock  which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing  decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage for the company  and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future

table of contents item property descriptions operating properties the greens creek unit our various subsidiaries own of the greens creek mine located in southeast alaska 
the greens creek orebody contains silver  zinc  gold and lead  and lies adjacent to the admiralty island national monument  an environmentally sensitive area 
the greens creek property includes patented lode claims and one patented mill site claim  in addition to property leased from the us forest service 
greens creek also has title to mineral rights on  acres of federal land adjacent to the properties 
the entire project is accessed by boat and served by miles of road and consists of the mine  an ore concentrating mill  a tailings impoundment area  a ship loading facility  camp facilities and a ferry dock 
the map below illustrates the location and access to greens creek prior to april   we owned a interest in greens creek 
on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the equity of two rio tinto subsidiaries holding a interest in the greens creek mine for approximately million 
the acquisition gives our various subsidiaries control of of the greens creek mine  as our wholly owned subsidiary  hecla alaska llc  owned an undivided joint venture interest in the assets of greens creek prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest 
the greens creek deposit is a polymetallic  stratiform  massive sulfide deposit 
the host rock consists of predominantly marine sedimentary  and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks  which have been subjected to multiple periods of deformation 
these deformational episodes have imposed intense tectonic fabrics on the rocks 
mineralization occurs discontinuously along the contact between a structural hanging wall of quartz mica carbonate phyllites and a structural footwall of graphitic and calcareous argillite 
major sulfide minerals are pyrite  sphalerite  galena  and tetrahedrite tennanite 
pursuant to a land exchange agreement  the joint venture transferred private property equal to a value of million to the us forest service and received exploration and mining rights to approximately  acres of land with mining potential surrounding the existing mine 
production from new ore discoveries on the exchanged lands will be subject to federal royalties included in the land exchange agreement 
the royalty is only due on production from reserves that are not part of greens creek s extralateral rights 
thus far  there has been no production triggering payment of the royalty 
the royalty is if the average value of the ore during a year is greater than per ton of ore  and if the value is per ton or less 
the benchmark of per ton is adjusted annually according to the gross domestic product gdp implicit price deflator until the year  and at december   was at approximately per ton when applying the latest gdp implicit price deflator observation 
greens creek is an underground mine which produces approximately  tons of ore per day 
the primary mining methods are cut and fill and longhole stoping 
the ore is processed on site at a mill  which produces lead  zinc and bulk concentrates  as well as gold dor 
in  ore was processed at an average rate of approximately  tons per day 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  zinc  lead and gold 
the dor is sold to a precious metal refiner and on the open market and the three concentrate products are sold to a number of major smelters worldwide 
concentrates are shipped from a marine terminal located on admiralty island about nine miles from the mine site 

table of contents the greens creek unit has historically been powered completely by diesel generators located on site 
however  an agreement was reached during to purchase excess hydroelectric power from the local power company  alaska electric light and power company ael p 
installation of the necessary infrastructure was completed in  and use of hydroelectric power commenced during the third quarter of this project has reduced production costs at greens creek to the extent power has been available 
low lake levels and increased demand in the juneau area combined to restrict the amount of power available to greens creek during and however  the mine received an increased proportion of its power needs from ael p during we expect to receive most  if not all  of the mine s power from ael p in  and expect this to continue for the foreseeable future as a result of new capacity installed by ael p in the employees at greens creek are employees of our hecla greens creek mining company  our wholly owned subsidiary  and are not represented by a bargaining agent 
there were employees at the greens creek unit at december  all equipment  infrastructure and facilities  including camp and concentrate storage facilities  are in good condition 
as of december   we have recorded a million asset retirement obligation for reclamation and closure costs 
we maintain a million reclamation bond secured by the restricted cash balance of million for greens creek 
the net book value of the greens creek unit property and its associated plant  equipment and mineral interests was approximately million as of december  information with respect to production  average costs per ounce of silver produced and proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the following table  and represents our ownership of greens creek after april   and our previous ownership prior to that date

estimates of proven and probable ore reserves for the greens creek unit as of december  and are derived from successive generations of reserve and feasibility analyses for different areas of the mine  using a separate assessment of metals prices for each year 
the weighted average prices used for reserve estimates in  prior to our acquisition of the remaining interest in greens creek  were determined by the geology and engineering staff of the kennecott greens creek mining company  then an indirect subsidiary of rio tinto  plc  with our technical support 
the prices differ from the prices used by us  for example  in making such calculations for our lucky friday unit for that year 
we reviewed the geologic interpretation and reserve methodology  but the reserve compilation for for greens creek was not independently confirmed by us in its entirety 
the average prices used for the greens creek unit were 
table of contents december  silver per ounce gold per ounce lead per pound zinc per pound ore reserves represent in place material  diluted and adjusted for expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries of ore reserve grades differ by ore zones and are expected to average for silver  for gold  for zinc and for lead 
the changes in reserves in versus are due to lower anticipated ore grades and depletion due to production  partially offset by the addition of new drill data and increases in forecasted precious metals prices 
the changes in reserves in versus are due to our acquisition of the remaining of greens creek in april  along with the addition of new drill data and increases in forecasted precious metals prices  partially offset by depletion due to production 
we only report probable reserves at the greens creek unit  which are based on average drill spacing of to feet 
proven reserves typically require that mining samples are partly the basis of the ore grade estimates used  while probable reserve grade estimates can be based entirely on drilling results 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by orebody and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
cutoff grades range from per ton net smelter return to per ton net smelter return 
reflects our ownership interest until april   and our ownership thereafter 
an independent review by amec e c  inc was completed in for the reserve models for the n and northwest west zones 
the average silver grade has decreased in relative to this decrease is primarily due to additional drilling which has reduced the impact of higher grade zones included in in addition  the increase in silver prices has reduced cutoff grade along with greater reliance on higher volume long hole stoping  which has the impact of reducing overall ore grades 
the lucky friday unit since  we have owned and operated the lucky friday unit  a deep underground silver  lead and zinc mine located in the coeur d alene mining district in northern idaho 
lucky friday is one quarter mile east of mullan  idaho  and is adjacent to us interstate below is a map illustrating the location and access to the lucky friday unit there have been two ore bearing structures mined at the lucky friday unit 
the first  mined through  was the lucky friday vein  a fissure vein typical of many in the coeur d alene mining district 
the orebody is located in the revett formation  which is known to provide excellent host rocks for a number of orebodies in the coeur d alene mining district 
the lucky friday vein strikes northeasterly and dips steeply to the south with an average width of six to seven feet 
its principal ore minerals are galena and tetrahedrite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite 
the ore occurs as a single continuous orebody in and along the lucky friday vein 
the major part of the orebody has extended from the  foot level to and below the  foot level 

table of contents the second ore bearing structure  known as the lucky friday expansion area  has been mined since pursuant to an operating agreement with independence lead mines company independence 
during  we discovered several mineralized structures containing some high grade silver ores in an area known as the gold hunter property  approximately  feet northwest of the then existing lucky friday workings 
this discovery led to the development of the gold hunter property on the level 
on november   we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of independence  including all future interest or royalty obligation to independence and the mining claims pertaining to their agreement with us see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the principal mining method at the lucky friday unit is ramp access  cut and fill 
this method utilizes rubber tired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the orebody 
once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein  it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed  either above or below  from the ramp system 
the ore produced from lucky friday is processed in a conventional flotation mill  which produces both a lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate 
in  ore was processed at an average rate of approximately tons per day 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  lead and zinc 
all silver lead and zinc concentrate production during was shipped to teck cominco limited s smelter in trail  british columbia  canada

proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by ore body and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
due to multiple ore metals  and complex combinations of ore types  metal ratios and metallurgical performances at the lucky friday  the cutoff grade is expressed in terms of net smelter return nsr  rather than metal grade 
the cutoff grade at the lucky friday ranges from per ton nsr to per ton nsr 
our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices december  silver per ounce lead per pound zinc per pound reserves are in place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries are expected to be for silver  for lead and for zinc 
zinc recovery has improved from historical levels due to mill upgrades completed during  and the changes in reserves in versus  and in versus  are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work  higher anticipated ore grades  and increases in forecasted metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates  partially offset by depletion due to production 
the change in reserves in versus is also attributed to potential expansion of the mine plan resulting from deeper access beyond the current workings 
an independent audit by scott wilson roscoe postle associates  inc was completed in january for the reserve model at the lucky friday mine 
during  we initiated engineering  procurement and development activities relating to construction of an internal shaft at the lucky friday mine  which  upon completion  will provide access from the level down to the level of the mine 
however  the project was temporarily placed on hold in the fourth quarter of due to then prevailing metals prices 
detailed engineering  long lead time procurement  and other early stage activities for the internal shaft project resumed in current activities include engineering  purchase of long lead time equipment including hoists and service trucks  and pre development construction from existing workings to the proposed shaft collar  hoist room and other facilities on the level 
ultimate reclamation activities are anticipated to include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas 
no final reclamation activities were performed in  and at december   an asset retirement obligation of approximately million had been recorded for reclamation and closure costs 
the net book value of the lucky friday unit property and its associated plant  equipment and mineral interests was approximately million as of december  the construction of the facilities at lucky friday ranges from the s to  and all are in good physical condition 
in  and  we made capital improvements to our processing plant to improve concentrate grades and metal recoveries 
additions included a three stage crushing system  increased flotation capacity and two new flash cells  new column cells and tailings thickeners  and an on stream analyzer 
the plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside contractors as required

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview established in in northern idaho s silver valley  hecla mining company has long been well known in the mining world and financial markets as a quality producer of silver and gold 
headquartered in coeur d alene  idaho  this international  nyse traded company is years old 
our production profile includes silver  gold  lead  and zinc contained in concentrates shipped to various smelters gold dor our operating properties and exploration interests are located in jurisdictions with relatively moderate political and economic risk in the united states and mexico  and are located in historically successful mining districts 
we have two business segments for financial reporting purposes the greens creek operating unit on admiralty island in alaska and the lucky friday operating unit in idaho 
our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our production and locating and developing new resource potential 
in  we attained record revenue  gross profit  and cash flow from operating activities  milestones directly related to our acquisition of the remaining interest of the greens creek mine near juneau  alaska in produced record ore volume through our lucky friday mine near mullan  idaho 
significantly boosted our financial liquidity  fully repaying all outstanding debt and ending the year with a cash and cash equivalents balance of over million 
increased our exploration budget during the year compared to our expectations at the beginning of the year by  drilling targets at each of our four land packages in alaska  idaho  colorado  and mexico 
like many companies  we were affected by the global financial crisis and recession 
after seeing the silver price fall from a high of to a low of in  we saw prices rebound to an average of for the year and for the fourth quarter of similar volatility was shown by our important base metals by products  lead and zinc  which fell by two thirds during  but have since rebounded to levels double their low points in the increased exposure to metals prices offered by our ownership of of greens creek in  combined with cost controls across the board  put us in a position to benefit significantly from the price recovery and achieve the milestones described above 
our increased production  resulting both from operational efforts and full year ownership of greens creek  rebounding metals prices  and proceeds from issuances of equity securities allowed us to fully repay the million in debt outstanding at december   and to redeem preferred shares and hedging instruments related to the debt 
our cost management efforts made significant contributions to our results as well 
greens creek mining and milling costs fell by per ton in  attributable both to the efforts of our people and to decreased fuel costs following completion of a dam giving us access to additional hydroelectric power 
our mining and milling costs at lucky friday declined by in the same period due to a cost reduction program 
we increased our production of silver to a record million ounces in  up from million ounces in production of lead and zinc  important by products at our lucky friday and greens creek mines  also increased to record levels in  with production of lead higher by and zinc by due to higher ore volumes and grades at both operations and our acquisition of the remaining interest in greens creek 
revenues increased by in over  resulting from higher realized prices  the full year ownership of greens creek  and higher ore throughput and grades 
we reported diluted income per share of in compared to a loss of in gross profit from operations improved to million in from million in as a result of higher realized prices for all four metals we sell and lower operating costs per ton  although our results were dampened somewhat  as anticipated  by higher depreciation of our newly acquired interest in greens creek and increased depreciable assets at lucky friday 
exploration costs were lower in due to cost reduction efforts through the first part of the year  but increased in the fourth quarter 
general and administrative costs increased by million in primarily resulting from severance costs related to a reduction in workforce  and to decreases to the valuation of stock appreciation rights in that did not recur in we recorded gains on sales of investments and fixed assets  net of losses on impairments of investments  of million in versus in in we recorded a million tax benefit from a decreased valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
in we recorded an overall tax provision  as we did not decrease the valuation allowance as a result of declining metals prices at that time 

table of contents the factors driving metals prices are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
as noted above  prices have been highly volatile in the last two years 
average prices in compared to those in and are illustrated in the results of operations section below 
key issues we intend to achieve our strategy of increasing production and expanding our proven and probable reserves through development and exploration  as well as by future acquisitions 
our strategic plan requires that we manage several pervasive challenges and risks inherent in conducting mining  development  exploration and metal sales at multiple locations 
one such risk involves metals prices 
while the metals mining industry enjoyed continued strength in metals prices from through mid  we have no control over prices 
as noted above  silver  lead and zinc prices have been highly volatile  falling sharply in the last quarter of and recovering through industrial demand of silver is closely linked to world gdp growth and to industrial fabrication levels  as it is difficult to substitute silver in industrial fabrication 
we believe that global economic conditions are beginning to improve and that industrial trends  including growth of the middle class in countries like china and india  will result in continued consumer and industrial demand for silver 
investment demand for silver and gold has been relatively strong for the past three years and is influenced by various factors  including the strength of the us dollar and other currencies  expanding us budget deficits  widening availability of exchange traded commodity funds  interest rate levels  the health of credit markets  and inflationary expectations 
uncertainty towards a global economic recovery could result in continued investment demand for precious metals 
however  there can be no assurance whether these trends will continue or to how they will impact prices of the metals we produce 
we must make our strategic plans in the context of significant uncertainty about future revenues  which may impact new opportunities that require many years and substantial cost from discovery to production 
we approach this challenge by investing exploration and capital in districts with an established history of success  and in managing our operations in a manner that seeks to mitigate the effects of lower prices 
in the coming year we anticipate an increase in exploration activity compared to at or near our operating mines at greens creek and lucky friday  as well as at our exploration projects in colorado and mexico 
the recent unprecedented volatility in global financial markets poses a significant challenge to our ability to access credit and equity markets and to sell our products at a profit 
we have seen our share price rebound from its lowest levels in and have eliminated our debt partly by increasing our shares outstanding by during and issuing warrants at exercises prices ranging from to per share 
we have also entered into a three year  million revolving credit agreement under which there are no outstanding borrowings as of december   yet our ability to retain the facility depends in part on financial thresholds driven by the prices of products we sell 
another challenge is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities 
as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities may change in the future  affecting our strategic plans 
in addition  proposed measures to address climate change and green house gas emissions could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see item a 
risk factors legal  market and regulatory risks we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
in accordance with our environmental policy  we attempt to conduct our operating activities in a manner that minimizes risks to public health and safety 
we attempt to design and manage our projects to reasonably minimize risk and negative effects on the environment 
we intend to continue to strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to attempt to settle the environmental litigation 
reserve estimation is a major risk inherent in mining 
our reserve estimates  which drive our mining and investment plans and many of our costs  may change based on economic factors and actual production experience 
until ore is actually mined and processed  the volumes and grades of our reserves must be considered as estimates 
our reserves are depleted as we mine 
reserves can also change as a result of changes in metals prices and costs  as well as economic and operating assumptions 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported income applicable to common shareholders of million compared to a loss applicable to common shareholders of million in and income applicable to common shareholders of million in the following factors led to the improved results for the year ended december  compared to and

an adjustment of million in to increase our estimated liabilities for environmental remediation in idaho s coeur d alene basin and the bunker hill superfund site 
during the second quarter of  we finalized a proposed multi year clean up plan for the upper portion of the coeur d alene basin  together with an estimate of related costs to implement the plan 
based on that work and a reassessment of our other potential liabilities in the basin  we increased our accrual for remediation in the basin by million 
we also accrued an additional million for the remaining bunker hill superfund site work 
however  we also recorded an increase of approximately million in the fourth quarter of to our estimated liabilities for environmental remediation at our grouse creek unit million and the bunker hill superfund site million as a result of revisions to the reclamation work plans

table of contents concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment 
due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with the smelters  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metal prices each period through final settlement 
the differences between our realized metal prices and average market prices are due in part to price adjustments included in our revenues resulting from the difference between metal prices upon transfer of title of concentrates to the buyer and metal prices at the time of final settlement 
for  we reported positive adjustments to provisional settlements of million compared to negative adjustments to provisional settlements of million in and million in our realized prices for silver and gold were higher in compared to and realized prices in for lead and zinc were higher than their levels  but lower than our realized prices for those metals in while hecla s average realized prices for all four metals exceeded average market prices in  we believe that market metal price trends are a significant factor in our operating and financial performance 
because we are unable to predict fluctuations in prices for metals and have limited control over the timing of our concentrate shipments  there can be no assurance that our realized prices will exceed or even meet average market metals prices for any future period 
other significant variances affecting the comparison of our income applicable to common shareholders for to results for and were as follows lower average market prices for zinc and lead in compared to as illustrated by the table above

the increase in gross profit during compared to and was primarily the result of the following factors positive price adjustments to revenues of million during compared to negative price adjustments of million in and million in price adjustments to our revenues result from changes in the estimated settlement prices for our provisionally priced concentrate sales 
an increase in our share of production due to our acquisition of the remaining of greens creek in april cost of sales in included the excess of fair value over cost of the finished and in process product inventory acquired upon purchase of the ownership interest 
upon the sale of the acquired inventory  the excess of fair market value over costs was expensed  which increased cost of sales and decreased gross profit margin in by million 
lower production costs  which decreased in by and  respectively  per ton of ore milled  compared to and  respectively 
the lower costs are primarily due to increased availability of grid hydroelectric power  lower diesel prices and improved ore production 
higher average prices for gold in compared to and these factors were partially offset by a decline in average market prices for zinc and lead from their levels in higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in by million compared to and million compared to as a result of the fair market valuation of the acquired share of property  plant  equipment and mineral interests at the acquisition date  additional depreciable assets placed into service  and an increase in units of production depreciation driven by higher production in silver ore grades in that were lower by and  respectively  compared to and 
table of contents mine license taxes that increased in by million compared to and million compared to the higher taxes are due to the increased profits resulting from the factors discussed above 
the greens creek operation is partially powered by diesel generators  and production costs are significantly affected by fluctuations in fuel prices 
infrastructure has been installed that allows hydroelectric power to be supplied to greens creek by ael p via a submarine cable from north douglas island  near juneau  to admiralty island  where greens creek is located 
this project has reduced production costs at greens creek to the extent power has been available 
during  the mine received an increased proportion of its power needs from ael p 
we expect this to continue in the foreseeable future 
the decrease in total cash cost per silver ounce in compared to is primarily due to production costs and treatment and freight costs that decreased by and per ounce  respectively  and by product credits that increased by per ounce  partially offset by production taxes that increased by per ounce 
the increase in total cash costs per silver ounce in compared to is attributable to lower by product credits by per ounce and production costs and treatment and freight that increased by and per ounce  respectively 
while value from zinc  lead and gold by products is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery  the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver  and in most of its working areas  greens creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
within our cost per ounce calculations  because we consider zinc  lead and gold to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset operating costs

the million increase in gross profit for compared to is primarily the result of higher production  due to higher silver ore grades and increased mill tonnage  and a decrease in production costs 
in addition  positive price adjustments to revenues of million impacted results for due to increases in metals prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlement during the year 
revenues for at lucky friday included million in negative price adjustments 
the million decrease in gross profit in compared to resulted primarily from lower average lead and zinc prices  a increase in production costs  and silver ore grades that decreased by 
in addition  the million in negative price adjustments for were higher than million in negative price adjustments for the decrease in total cash costs per silver ounce in compared to is primarily due to lower production costs and treatment and freight costs by and per ounce  respectively 
the lower costs were partially offset by a decrease in by product credits by per ounce due to lower average lead and zinc prices 
the increase in total cash costs in compared to is attributed to lower by product credits by per ounce and higher production costs and treatment and freight costs by and per ounce  respectively 
while value from lead and zinc is significant at the lucky friday  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with zinc and lead as by products  is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  the lucky friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production  and the lucky friday unit generally utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
within our cost per ounce calculations  because we consider zinc and lead to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset operating costs

tables in previous periods have presented gold cost per ounce  however as a result of our sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of el callao and drake bering  our gold operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
total cash costs include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals  including mining  processing and other plant costs  third party refining expense  on site general and administrative costs  royalties and mining production taxes  net of by product revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit 
total cash costs provide management and investors an indication of net cash flow  after consideration of the realized price received for production sold 
management also uses this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period to period from a cash flow perspective 
total cash cost per ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard  however  there can be no assurance that our reporting of this non gaap measure is similar to that reported by other mining companies 
cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to total cash costs

we plan to use the facility for general corporate purposes and  based on our current cash position and business plan  we do not currently anticipate drawing on the facility in the near term 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on how the covenants in our credit facility may impact our liquidity and capital resources in the future 
we also may pursue additional acquisition opportunities or capital expansion projects  which could require additional equity issuances or financing 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available to us 

table of contents as a result of our current cash balance  improved performance of our operations  current metals prices  and full availability of our million revolving credit agreement  we believe our cash  cash equivalents  investments  cash from operations  and availability of financing if needed will be adequate to meet our obligations during the next twelve months 
we estimate that approximately to million will be committed to sustaining capital expenditures through the end of this year 
in addition  we are evaluating alternatives for deeper access in our lucky friday mine to increase its production and longevity 
deeper access will require significant capital resources over several years duration 
our ability to finance such a program will depend on our operational performance  metals prices  our ability to estimate capital costs  and sources of liquidity available to us 
we believe that our available cash  revolving credit agreement  cash from operations  and access to equity and financial markets will allow us to proceed if project economics appear to be favorable  and we may also mitigate market risk from time to time with selective base metal hedging programs 
however  a sustained downturn in metals prices or significant increases in operational or capital costs could compel us to suspend the project in the future 
year ended december cash provided by operating activities in millions cash provided by operating activities increased million in due to improved results of operations 
net income from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash elements  increased by million in due to improved prices and production  lower interest expense  and lower exploration 
working capital changes reduced cash flow  primarily as a result of a million increase in the change in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to an increase in the quantity of concentrate shipped that is pending final settlement at year end versus and an increase in metals prices in  resulting in higher values per ton of concentrate 
in addition  a adjustment to product inventory related to the purchase price allocation for greens creek did not have a counterpart in to the benefit of cash flows  however  million in net cash used by discontinued operations in had no comparable event in the lower cash provided by operating activities in compared to the period resulted primarily from a million reduction in income from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items resulting from lower metals prices and higher costs  partly offset by a million increase in cash resulting from changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable  inventories  and other assets and liabilities 
the decrease in was also impacted by increased losses from discontinued operations  including foreign exchange losses totaling million incurred on exchange of venezuelan bol vares for us dollars

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic  political  regulatory  and other factors that affect our business prospects 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  mineral reserves  and accounting for business combinations  as they require us to make assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed to be critical 
however  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
future metals prices metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities  including properties  plants and equipment  deferred tax assets  and certain accounts receivable 
as shown under item a 
risk factors  metals prices have been historically volatile 
while average prices for all four metals we produce performed favorably for the five consecutive years prior to  there was a reduction in the average prices for zinc and lead in compared to  and average prices for silver  zinc and lead were lower in compared to we have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices in the past  and we can offer no assurance that prices will either remain at their current levels or increase 
processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analyses of asset carrying values  depreciation  and deferred income taxes 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant we examine the carrying values of our assets  our depreciation rates  and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
in our analyses of carrying values and deferred taxes  we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model  including current prices  analyst price estimates  forward curve prices  and historical prices see mineral reserves  below  regarding prices used for reserve estimates 
using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets  we use the average of the various methods to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated  and to determine the level of valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
in addition  estimates of future metals prices are used in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions see business combinations below 
sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at estimated forward metals prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed from shipment to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales and trade accounts receivable are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in changes to revenues and accounts receivable previously recorded upon shipment 
as a result  our trade accounts receivable balances are subject to changes in metals prices until final settlement occurs 
for more information  see part o 
revenue recognition of note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
obligations for environmental  reclamation and closure matters the most significant liability on our balance sheet is for accrued reclamation and closure costs 
we have conducted considerable remediation work at sites in the united states for which remediation requirements have not been fully determined  nor have they been agreed between us and various regulatory agencies with oversight over the properties 
we have estimated our liabilities with counsel and in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if warranted management reviews our liabilities with our audit committee 
however  the range of liability proposed by the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings considerably exceeds the liabilities we have recognized 
if substantial damages were awarded or remediation costs incurred in excess of our accruals  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents mineral reserves critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves 
our reserves are affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices  as well as by engineering and geological estimates of ore grade  accessibility and production cost 
metals prices are estimated at long term averages  as described in item property descriptions 
our assessment of reserves occurs at least annually  and periodically utilizes external audits 
reserves are a key component in valuation of our properties  plants and equipment 
reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of units of production depreciation  with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated reserves 
reserves are also a key component in forecasts  with which we compare future cash flows to current asset values to ensure that carrying values are reported appropriately 
reserves also play a key role in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions see business combinations below 
reserves are a culmination of many estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date 
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived assets  including estimates of future metals prices and mineral reserves  as discussed above 
in some cases  we use third party appraisers to determine the fair values and lives of property and other identifiable assets 
new accounting pronouncements in december  fasb financial staff position fsp no 
fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets asc  was issued to provide guidance on an employer s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other post retirement plan 
this guidance became effective for fiscal years ending after december  adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued asu  which amends subtopic to require new disclosures on fair value measurements as follows the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of levels and separate information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in level fair value measurements 
asu also provides amendments to subtopic that clarifies existing fair value measurement disclosures as follows a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
a class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position 
a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
those disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level asu also includes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets subtopic  changes the terminology in subtopic from major categories of assets to classes of assets  and provides a cross reference to the guidance in subtopic on how to determine appropriate classes to present fair value disclosures 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis  as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this form k  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby 
see the discussion in special note on forward looking statements included prior to part i  item 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  as well as summarizes the financial instruments held by us at december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and commodity prices and are not held for trading purposes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable see part i  item a 
risk factors 
short term investments from time to time we hold various types of short term investments that are subject to changes in market interest rates and are sensitive to those changes 
we did not carry any such short term investments as of december  commodity price risk management at times  we use commodity forward sales commitments  commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which we produce 
contract positions are designed to ensure that we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production 
we use these instruments to reduce risk by offsetting market exposures 
we had no commodity related derivative positions at december  interest rate risk management on may   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the libor based variable interest obligations associated with our term facility 
on february   we reached an agreement to amend the terms of our credit facilities to defer all scheduled term facility principal payments due in  totaling million  to and on june   we repaid million of the outstanding term credit facility balance using proceeds from a private placement equity offering see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information  and on june   we repaid an additional million of the outstanding term facility balance as a part of another amendment to our term credit facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these credit facility amendments and repayments  the hedging relationship was de designated and a new hedging relationship was re designated in each case 
a final retrospective hedge effectiveness assessment was performed on the prior hedging relationships at the date of each de designation  and only the may  hedging relationship was determined to be ineffective for the first quarter ended march  consequently  the change in fair value of the swap of million between december  and february  was recorded as a gain on the income statement 
as a result of the swap  the interest payable related to the term facility was to be fixed at a rate of until the scheduled maturity on september  according to the amended and restated credit agreement 
see note q 
risk management contracts for more information 
hedge accounting was applied for this swap and the terms of the interest rate swap agreement including the notional amounts  interest rate reset dates  and maturity dates matched the terms of the hedged note to which the swap agreement pertains 
the hedge was determined to be highly effective at offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged note 
however  on october   we repaid the remaining million term facility balance see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
as a result  we determined hedge accounting for the swap to be inappropriate as of september   and wrote off the remaining million accumulated unrealized loss and recorded a  mark to market adjustment for the fair value of the swap through interest expense in the third quarter of in october  we paid million to settle the remaining fair value liability associated with the swap 
for additional information regarding our credit facilities  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on october   we entered into a million revolving credit agreement for a three year term 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we have not drawn on the revolving credit facility 
however  if used  amounts borrowed under the facility would be subject to changes in market interest rates 
provisional sales sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters  including by product metals  are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at estimated forward prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed from shipment to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in changes to revenues previously recorded upon shipment 
our concentrate sales are based on a provisional sales price containing an embedded derivative that is required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes 
the host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrates at the forward price at the time of the sale 
the embedded derivative  which does not qualify for hedge accounting  is adjusted to market through earnings each period prior to final settlement 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control see item a risk factors a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for more information 
at december   metals contained in concentrates sold and exposed to future price changes totaled  ounces of silver   ounces of gold   tons of zinc  and  tons of lead 
if the price of each metal were to change by one percent  the change in the total value of the concentrates sold would be approximately million
