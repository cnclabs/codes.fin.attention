item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended december    and included with this report 
the following information contains forward looking statements  see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company formed in  and we are engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and operation of oil and natural gas properties  with a focus on our reserves and production from the inland waters of louisiana and from our onshore louisiana and texas properties 
we are one of the largest producers of crude oil in the state of louisiana  due to our south louisiana operations  with oil constituting of our production  and together with oil and natural gas liquids ngls making up of our production 
this emphasis has allowed us to benefit from better margins for oil production than natural gas production in unless otherwise noted  both historical information for all periods and forward looking information provided in this management s discussion and analysis relates solely to our continuing operations located in the united states  and excludes our new zealand operations discontinued in oil and natural gas pricing significantly reduced prices for oil and natural gas have had a significant impact on our cash flow  capital expenditures  and liquidity over the past year 
both oil and natural gas prices we received in were lower than the average prices we received in  with a decline in average prices per boe received 
these declines reduced our cash flow from operations in and will continue to reduce our cash flow from operations in future periods if prices remain at these lower levels 
although prices at the end of were higher than the average prices we received during  these prices were still significantly lower than the prices we received during financial condition we raised million through an underwritten public stock offering in august we issued million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the gross proceeds from these sales were approximately million  before deducting underwriting commissions and issuance costs totaling million 
in november  we issued million of senior notes due at of par  which equates to an effective yield to maturity of 
in december  we redeemed all million of our senior notes due and recorded a charge of million related to the redemption of these notes  which is recorded in debt retirement costs on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the costs were comprised of approximately million of premium paid to redeem the notes  and million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs 
we used the proceeds from this stock sale and note offering  less costs to redeem our senior notes due  to pay down the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
our debt to capitalization ratio decreased to at december   as compared to at year end  as paid in capital increased and our total debt balance decreased due to our stock offering  offset somewhat by a retained earnings decrease due to our net loss for  which included a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties 
operating results prior year comparison in we had revenues of million  a decrease of compared to levels 
our weighted average sales price received decreased to per boe for from per boe in this million decrease in revenues from levels resulted from lower oil  natural gas  and ngl prices during  along with a decrease in production mainly due to natural declines in our lake washington field 
our overall costs and expenses decreased in by million when compared to levels 
the period included a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties of million in the fourth quarter of  while the period included a non cash write down of our oil and gas properties of million in the first quarter of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense also decreased  mainly due to our lower depletable property base in the period due to the non cash write downs mentioned above  lower production in the period  partially offset by a reduction in reserves volumes when compared to the period 
severance and other taxes decreased mainly due to decreased oil and gas revenues 
lease operating costs decreased by due to less hurricane related costs  decreased workover costs  decreased natural gas processing costs  and a decrease in plant operating expense resulting from targeted cost reduction initiatives 
our loss from continuing operations for was million 
if the million million after tax first quarter non cash write down of our oil and gas properties is excluded our income after tax would have been million 
this compares to a loss from continuing operations of million 
if the million million after tax fourth quarter non cash write down of our oil and gas properties is excluded our income after tax would have been million for operating activities in our south texas core area  the first three wells of our horizontal drilling and completion program targeting the olmos formation at the awp field finished drilling and were completed  while another horizontal well was completed in january we also drilled seven vertical wells in the awp field 
in january  we commenced drilling two wells targeting the eagle ford shale formation and expect them both to be completed during march additionally  in excess of wells in the awp field have been identified as candidates for additional fracture stimulation 
in  twenty nine of these wells have been re fractured 
we plan to perform thirty re fracture operations in in november  we entered into a joint venture agreement with an independent oil and gas producer to jointly develop and operate an approximate  acre portion of our eagle ford shale acreage in mcmullen county  texas 
swift energy retains a interest in the joint venture that calls for joint development of this area located in our awp field and covers leasehold interests beneath the olmos formation including the eagle ford shale formation extending to the base of the pearsall formation 
we received approximately million in cash related to this transaction and approximately million of carried interests 
the first well under the joint venture agreement  in which we own a interest  commenced drilling in late december to test the eagle ford shale formation and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of in the central louisiana east texas core area  we recently entered into a joint venture agreement with a large independent oil and gas producer active in the area for development and exploitation in and around the burr ferry field in vernon parish  louisiana 
the company  as fee mineral owner  leased a working interest in approximately  gross acres to the joint venture partner 
swift energy retains a working interest in the joint venture acreage as well as its fee mineral royalty rights  and received approximately million related to this transaction 
at lake washington during  a production optimization program involving gas lift enhancements and sliding sleeve shifts to change productive zones was continued to assist in mitigation of natural field declines 
in we completed sliding sleeve changes  gas lift modifications  and acid jobs 
we also drilled shallow wells in the later part of  completing four of them while one was unsuccessful 
in our southeast louisiana and south louisiana core areas we have completed  square miles of d prestack seismic depth migration over our lake washington  shasta  bay de chene  high island  cote blanche island  horseshoe bayou  bayou sale and jeanerette fields 
this depth migration and updated salt model has significantly improved and refined our understanding of the complex traps associated with salt bodies and will enable us to more accurately plan and position our exploratory and development wells 
this seismic processing combined with seismic pore pressure prediction has allowed us to increase our confidence in well planning and drilling of wells that are deeper and larger in our southeast louisiana and south louisiana areas 
the improved seismic image in our southeast louisiana and south louisiana core areas described above has delivered additional high value prospects which could be drilled later this year or next depending upon the commodity pricing environment 
we have spent considerable time and capital on facility capacity upgrades and additions in the lake washington field 
our fourth production platform  the westside facility  was commissioned in the second quarter of in the first quarter of  the through put capacity of this facility was doubled to  barrels of oil per day and mmcf of natural gas per day 
as a result of this expansion  and continued production decline in older portions of the field  production from our sl facility was redirected to westside 
this has resulted in a reduction in lease operating expenses as the westside facilities are newer and require less maintenance 
the expanded capacity at the westside facilities was also utilized to process production from our sl shasta well starting in late april in the third quarter of  our bay de chene field experienced significant damage to its production facilities from hurricane gustav  and some production equipment in the field was damaged or destroyed 
also in the third quarter of  hurricane ike caused damage to several fields in our south louisiana core area and our high island field due to high water levels 
in april  we settled our marine insurance claim relating to hurricane gustav for a net amount after deductible of million  and in september settled our onshore claim relating to hurricane ike for a net amount after deductible of million 
both of these reimbursements related to both capital costs and lease operating expense  and we have no additional hurricane related claims outstanding 
repairs to existing infrastructure as well as the installation of new production equipment and structures for our bay de chene field were completed in the third quarter of in previous quarters  since hurricane gustav in  only high pressure natural gas was produced from the field through existing high pressure natural gas facilities 
oil and low pressure natural gas production was reinstated after repairs and new facilities installations were completed 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures on a cash flow basis during were million  while our accrual based capital expenditures were million  as during the first quarter of we paid significant accounts payable and accrued capital cost balances incurred prior to year end this cash flow basis amount of capital expenditures decreased by million as compared to the period  primarily due to a decrease in our spending on drilling and development  predominantly  in our southeast louisiana and south texas core areas 
these expenditures were primarily funded by million of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  and million from the sale of properties and proceeds from joint ventures 
we currently plan to balance our accrual based capital expenditures with our cash flow and cash on hand 
our capital expenditures are currently budgeted at million to million  net of minor non core dispositions and excluding any property acquisitions 
these expenditures are expected to include a continuation of the horizontal well drilling program in the olmos sands in our awp field  an ongoing horizontal well program in the eagle ford shale formation in the awp and other south texas areas  continuing our drilling activity in lake washington by targeting shallow and intermediate depth oil prospects  continuing the recompletion program in our southeast louisiana core area and the fracture enhancement program in our south texas core area 
actions taken in response to the credit crisis and downturn in the industry in  the company took several steps to manage lower cash flow and provide liquidity in future periods including raised million  after deducting commissions and offering costs  through an underwritten public stock offering in august we used the proceeds from this stock sale to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
issued million of senior notes due issued at of par in november in order to redeem all of our million of senior notes due in december reduced capital expenditures when compared to our total capital costs incurred of million including acquisitions 
we spent million in  which was below our cash provided by operating activities 
reduced our workforce 
in early  we reduced our workforce  in response to the change in our level of operational activity  which will lower general and administrative costs in future periods 
reduced our field lease operating expenses 
re determined our bank credit facility 
our borrowing base and commitment amount in november was re set at million  a decrease from our previous borrowing base and commitment amount of million 
results of continuing operations years ended   and revenues 
our revenues in decreased by compared to revenues in primarily due to lower oil and gas prices as well as decreased production from our southeast louisiana core area 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues due to higher oil and gas prices partially offset by decreased production from our southeast louisiana core area 
revenues for   and were substantially comprised of oil and gas sales 
crude oil production was of our production volumes in  in  and in natural gas production was of our production volumes in  in  and in the remaining production in each year was from natural gas liquids ngls 
our properties are divided into the following core areas the southeast louisiana core area includes the lake washington and bay de chene fields 
the central louisiana east texas core area includes the brookeland  masters creek  and south bearhead creek and chunchula fields 
the south louisiana core area includes the cote blanche island  horseshoe bayou bayou sale  jeanerette  bayou penchant fields and high island 
the south texas core area includes the awp  briscoe ranch  las tiendas  and sun tsh fields 
we also have a strategic growth category for our other strategic fields

costs and expenses 
our expenses in decreased million  or  compared to expenses for the reasons noted below 
our general and administrative expenses  net  decreased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  over levels 
the decrease in was primarily due to lower stock compensation and lower salaries from the workforce reduction in early  partially offset by lower capitalized amounts 
the increase in was primarily due to increased salaries and burdens associated with our expanded workforce  but was also impacted by increased restricted stock grants 
for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per boe produced decreased to per boe in from per boe in  compared to per boe in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for dd a decreased million  or  in  from levels and increased million  or in  from levels 
the decrease in was due to the write down of oil and gas properties in the first quarter of which lowered our depletable base in addition to lower production  partially offset by lower reserves volumes and higher future development costs 
the increase in was due to increases in the depletable oil and natural gas property base and lower reserves volumes  partially offset by lower production and lower future development costs 
industry costs for goods and services increased from to and contributed to the increase in our dd a expense for those years 
our dd a rate per boe of production was in  in  and in  resulting from decreases in per unit cost of reserves additions in and increases in per unit costs for and we recorded million  million  and million of accretion to our asset retirement obligation in   and  respectively 
our lease operating costs decreased million  or  compared to the level of such expenses in  while costs increased million  or over levels 
lease operating costs decreased during due to decreases in work over costs  decreasing costs for industry goods and services  as well as lower natural gas and ngl processing costs 
these costs increased in due to additional costs from properties acquired in the fourth quarter of  increased work over costs  increasing costs for industry goods and services and higher natural gas and ngl processing costs in clean up and repair costs related to hurricanes gustav and ike totaled million in our lease operating costs per boe produced were   and in   and  respectively 
severance and other taxes decreased million  or  from levels  while in these taxes increased million  or  over levels 
the decreases in were due primarily to lower commodity prices and lower production 
in they were caused by higher commodity prices  offset slightly by lower production 
severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in was caused by an increase in rates on louisiana natural gas  which increased approximately per mcf produced  along with a slight increase in total revenues from oil production 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized

interest expense on our senior notes due issued in june and retired in december  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in both and interest expense on our senior subordinated notes due issued in april and retired in  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in interest expense on our senior notes due and issued in june  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in both and interest expense on our senior notes due and issued in november  including amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount  totaled million in interest expense on our bank credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in  and million in other interest cost was million in each of  and we capitalize a portion of interest related to unproved properties 
the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to a decrease in borrowings against our line of credit facility during the year 
in  we incurred million of debt retirement costs related to the redemption of our senior notes due the costs were comprised of approximately million of premiums paid to repurchase the notes  and million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs 
in we incurred million of debt retirement costs related to the redemption of our senior notes due the costs were comprised of approximately million of premiums paid to repurchase the notes  and million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs 
in the first quarter of  as a result of low oil and gas prices at march  we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and natural gas properties 
in the fourth quarter of  as a result of low oil and natural gas prices at december   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and natural gas properties 
our overall effective tax rate was for  for  and for the effective tax rate for   and was higher than the statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes 
valuation allowances also contributed to the effective rates 
loss from continuing operations

net loss 
our net loss in of million was significantly less than our net loss of million  due to the write down of oil and gas properties in december  partially offset by lower oil and gas sales 
our net loss in of million was significantly lower than our net income of million  due to the write down of oil and gas properties  partially offset by higher oil and gas sales 
discontinued operations in december  swift energy agreed to sell substantially all of our new zealand assets 
accordingly  the new zealand operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows and the assets and associated liabilities have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
in june  swift energy completed the sale of substantially all of our new zealand assets for million in cash after purchase price adjustments 
proceeds from this asset sale were used to pay down a portion of our credit facility 
in august  we completed the sale of our remaining new zealand permit for million  with three million payments to be received nine months after the sale  months after the sale  and months after the sale 
all payments under this sale agreement are secured by unconditional letters of credit 
due to ongoing litigation  we have evaluated the situation and determined that certain revenue recognition criteria have not been met at this time for the permit sale  and have deferred the potential gain on this property sale pending final resolution of this litigation 
in accordance with guidance contained in fasb asc formerly sfas no 
 the results of operations and the non cash asset write down for the new zealand operations have been excluded from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations for the current and prior periods 
furthermore  the assets included as part of this divestiture have been reclassified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
during  the company assessed its long lived assets in new zealand based on the selling price and terms of the sales agreement in place at that time and recorded a non cash asset write down of million related to these assets 
this write down is recorded in loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the following table summarizes the amounts included in loss from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
these revenues and expenses were historically reported under our new zealand operating segment  and are now reported in discontinued operations in thousands except per share amounts oil and gas sales other revenues total revenues depreciation  depletion  and amortization other operating expenses non cash write down of property and equipment total expenses loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax benefit loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes loss per common share from discontinued operations diluted sales volumes mboe cash flow provided by used in operating activities capital expenditures loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for decreased compared to as the majority of our assets were sold in and day to day operations ceased 
our loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for increased compared to as the majority of our assets were sold in our capitalized general and administrative expenses were immaterial for and with million for commodity price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and over the last year that volatility has increased to extreme levels  and this volatility is expected to continue for and possibly future periods 
the price of oil began to decline in the third quarter of  price declines accelerated in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  however  oil prices made some improvement in the later part of factors such as worldwide economic conditions and credit availability  worldwide supply disruptions  weather conditions  fluctuating currency exchange rates  and political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east  can cause fluctuations in the price of oil 
domestic natural gas prices remained high during much of when compared to longer term historical prices but began falling in the third quarter of and continued to fall throughout  showing slight improvement in late north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  economic conditions and credit availability  storage levels of natural gas  the level of liquefied natural gas imports  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
credit risk due to certain concentrations we extend credit  primarily in the form of uncollateralized oil and natural gas sales and joint interest owner s receivables  to various companies in the oil and gas industry  which results in a concentration of credit risk 
the concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in economic or other conditions within our industry and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk 
credit losses in and have been immaterial  but given the downturn in the industry we have examined every one of our purchasers of oil and gas for credit worthiness 
we believe that the risk of these unsecured receivables is mitigated by the size  reputation  and nature of the companies to which we extend credit 
for and  oil and gas sales to shell oil corporation and affiliates were and of total oil and gas sales  respectively  chevron corporation and its affiliates accounted for of our total oil and gas sales 
from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit or parent company guaranties  if applicable  to reduce risk of loss 
commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we have been party to various legal actions  which arise primarily from our activities as operator of oil and natural gas wells 
in management s opinion  the outcome of any such currently pending legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
as of december  we had no off balance sheet arrangements requiring disclosure pursuant to article a of regulation s k 
liquidity and capital resources recent extreme volatility in worldwide credit and financial markets  combined with extreme volatility in prices for oil and natural gas  all of which began in the third quarter of  may have a significant impact on our cash flow  capital expenditures  and liquidity in future periods 
see overview financial condition 
public stock offering 
we raised million through an underwritten public stock offering in august we issued million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the gross proceeds from these sales were approximately million  before deducting underwriting commissions and issuance costs totaling million 
we used the proceeds from this stock sale to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
debt issuance and debt retirements 
we issued million of senior notes due at of par  which equates to an effective yield to maturity of  in november the discount of million is recorded against long term debt on our balance sheet and will be amortized over the life of the note 
in december  we redeemed all million of senior notes due and recorded a charge of million related to the redemption of these notes  which is recorded in debt retirement costs on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
the costs were comprised of approximately million of premium paid to redeem the notes  and million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs 
net cash provided by operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  representing a decrease as compared to million generated during the million decrease in was primarily due to a decrease of million in revenues  mainly attributable to lower oil and natural gas prices as well as lower production  partially offset by lower lease operating costs and severance taxes due to lower oil and gas sales 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in revenues  mainly attributable to higher oil and natural gas prices during the first part of the year  offset in part by lower production and higher lease operating costs and severance taxes due to higher oil and gas sales 
accounts receivable 
we assess the collectability of accounts receivable  and  based on our judgment  we accrue a reserve when we believe a receivable may not be collected 
at both december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has been deducted from the total accounts receivable balances on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
existing credit facility 
we had no borrowings under our bank credit facility at december   and million in borrowings at december  our bank credit facility at december  consisted of a million credit facility with a syndicate of ten banks  and expires in october our revolving credit facility includes requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to adjusted working capital ratios and ebitdax  and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement and expect to remain in compliance with these provisions in and future periods 
our available borrowings under our line of credit facility provide us liquidity 
in light of recent credit market volatility  many financial institutions have experienced liquidity issues  and governments have intervened in these markets to create liquidity 
we have reviewed the creditworthiness of the banks that fund our credit facility 
however  if the current credit market volatility is prolonged  future extensions of our credit facility may contain terms and interest rates not as favorable as those of our current credit facility 
in november  the borrowing base and commitment amount were re set at million  a reduction from previous levels due to the issuance of our senior notes due the next scheduled borrowing base review is may  and it is possible the borrowing base and commitment amounts could be reduced due to lower oil and gas prices and the then current state of the financial and credit markets 
debt maturities 
our credit facility  which had no balance at december   extends until october  our million of senior notes mature june   and our million of senior notes mature january  working capital 
our working capital increased from a deficit of million at december   to a surplus of million at december  the increase primarily resulted from a decrease in accrued capital costs and an increase in cash and cash equivalents at december  due to proceeds received from the issuance of our new senior notes due  less the amounts used to redeem our senior notes due cash used in investing activities 
in our oil and gas property additions were million 
this amount decreased by million  as compared to additions in  primarily due to a decrease in our spending on drilling and development  predominantly in our southeast louisiana and south texas core areas 
these cash based amounts were significantly higher than accrual based capital expenditures as we paid significant accounts payable and accrued capital cost balances incurred prior to year end these expenditures were primarily funded by million of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  and million from the sale of properties and proceeds from joint ventures 
these investing activities included drilling twenty wells during four out of five development wells and one of two exploratory wells drilled in the southeast louisiana core area were completed while the one development well and one exploratory well were unsuccessful  and thirteen development wells were drilled in the south texas core area 
contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of december  are as follows thereafter total in thousands non cancelable operating leases asset retirement obligation drilling rigs  seismic services  and pipe inventory senior notes due senior notes due credit facility total our most significant office lease is in houston  texas and it extends until amounts shown by year are the net present value at december  amounts do not include the interest obligation  which is paid semiannually 
the credit facility expires in october and these amounts exclude a million standby letter of credit outstanding under this facility 
proved oil and gas reserves at year end  our proved reserves were mmboe with a pv value of billion pv is a non gaap measure  see the section titled oil and natural gas reserves in our property section for a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the closest gaap measure  the standardized measure 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent decrease of mmboe  or 
in  our proved natural gas reserves decreased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves decreased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent decrease of mmboe  or 
we added reserves over the past three years through both our drilling activity and purchases of minerals in place 
through drilling we added mmboe of proved reserves in  mmboe in  and mmboe in through acquisitions we added no reserves in  mmboe of proved reserves in and bcfe in at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end all of the mmboe of proved reserves added through drilling during were in our awp field 
these additions were primarily proved undeveloped additions based on the results of the horizontal drilling program conducted in the area during the year and would have been recorded as reserves additions under both the former and revised sec reserves regulations 
we obtained reasonable certainty regarding these reserves additions by applying the same methodologies that have been used historically in this field 
we did not record material proved reserves additions during as a result of the revised sec reserves regulations 
for financial statements issued on or after january  the sec changed its accounting guidelines for estimates of proved reserves 
estimates must now be based on either the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  or prices defined by existing contractual arrangements 
previous estimates were made using year end oil and gas sales prices that were held constant for that year s reserves calculation throughout the life of the properties 
the pv value of our domestic proved reserves at year end increased from the pv value at year end our average natural gas price used in the pv calculation for was per mcf 
this average price during was a decrease from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end our average oil price used in the pv calculation for was per bbl 
this average price during was an increase from per bbl at year end  compared to in reserves estimation 
uncertainties in this calculation stem from the estimating process related to quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and the present value of estimated future net cash flows 
proved reserves are quantities of hydrocarbons to be recovered in the future from underground oil and natural gas accumulations that cannot be directly measured in an exact way 
therefore  reserve estimates are made from gathered data of imperfect accuracy and are subject to the same uncertainties inherent in that data 
accordingly  reserves estimates may be different from the quantities of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered 
income taxes the tax laws in the jurisdictions we operate in are continuously changing and professional judgments regarding such tax laws can differ 
under guidance contained in fasb asc formerly sfas no 
 deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  given the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
we follow the recognition and disclosure provisions under guidance contained in fasb asc formerly fasb interpretation no 

under this guidance  tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more likely than not threshold  and those tax positions requiring recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
as a result of adopting this guidance on january   we reported a million decrease to our january  retained earnings balance and a corresponding increase to other long term liabilities 
during we recognized a tax benefit and reduced other long term liabilities by million to reverse an accrual for penalty and interest that was originally recorded in the fourth quarter of our current balance of unrecognized tax benefits is million 
if recognized  these tax benefits would fully impact our effective tax rate 
this benefit is likely to be recognized within the next months based on expiration of the audit statutory period 
our policy is to record interest and penalties relating to income taxes in income tax expense 
as of december   we do not have any amount accrued for interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions 
our us federal income tax returns for  and forward  our louisiana income tax returns from forward  our new zealand income tax returns after  and our texas franchise tax returns after remain subject to examination by the taxing authorities 
there are no material unresolved items related to periods previously audited by these taxing authorities 
no other state returns are significant to our financial position as of december  the company had a deferred tax asset of million for a capital loss carryforward that was fully offset by a valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of the company reversed this valuation allowance as it was able to utilize this loss carryover to offset a tax gain realized on a joint venture transaction that closed in december of critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized including internal costs incurred that are directly related to these activities and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
future development costs are estimated property by property based on current economic conditions and are amortized to expense as our capitalized oil and natural gas property costs are amortized 
we compute the provision for depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a of oil and natural gas properties using the unit of production method 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis 
the costs of unproved properties not being amortized are assessed quarterly  on a property by property basis  to determine whether such properties have been impaired 
in determining whether such costs should be impaired  we evaluate current drilling results  lease expiration dates  current oil and gas industry conditions  international economic conditions  capital availability  and available geological and geophysical information 
as these factors may change from period to period  our evaluation of these factors will change 
any impairment assessed is added to the cost of proved properties being amortized 
the calculation of the provision for dd a requires us to use estimates related to quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and estimates of unproved properties 
for both reserves estimates see discussion below and the impairment of unproved properties see discussion above  these processes are subjective  and results may change over time based on current information and industry conditions 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties including natural gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations  net of related salvage values and deferred income taxes  and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations  including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using period end prices  adjusted for the effects of hedging  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
we did not have any outstanding derivative instruments at december  that would materially affect this calculation 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
see the discussion above related to reserves estimation 
in  as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices at march   we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and gas properties 
in the fourth quarter of  we reported a non cash write down on a before tax basis of million million after tax on our oil and gas properties due to lower oil and natural gas prices at the end of given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could continue to change in the near term 
if oil and natural gas prices continue to decline from our period end prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is possible that additional non cash write downs of oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes  which also reduce our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  additional non cash write downs of our oil and natural gas properties could occur in the future 
we cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be  thus we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential future non cash write down of our oil and natural gas properties if a decrease in oil and or natural gas prices were to occur 
new accounting pronouncements 
in january  the fasb issued asu to amend oil and gas reserve accounting and disclosure guidance that aligns the oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosure requirements of topic extractive industries oil and gas with the requirements of sec release these releases are effective for financial statements issued on or after january  we have adopted this guidance for all reporting periods ending on or after december  this release changes the accounting and disclosure requirements surrounding oil and natural gas reserves and is intended to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure requirements  to align them with current industry practices and to adapt to changes in technology 
the most significant changes include changes to prices used in reserves calculations  for use in both disclosures and accounting impairment tests 
prices will no longer be based on a single day  period end price 
rather  they will be based on either the preceding months average price based on closing prices on the first day of each month  or prices defined by existing contractual arrangements 
disclosure of probable and possible reserves is allowed 
the estimation of reserves will allow the use of reliable technology that was not previously recognized by the sec 
numerous changes in reserves disclosures mandated by sec for form k 
reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped if there is a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered and they are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
the change in prices used to calculate reserves did not have a material impact upon our reserves estimation in the current period 
the new rule requiring the preceding month s average price for oil and natural gas resulted in a lower average price for our reserves calculations for than if we had used the previous method utilizing the current price at period end 
these changes could have a material impact upon our financial statements in future periods due to the uncertainty of oil and gas prices 
related party transactions we receive research  technical writing  publishing  and website related services from tec com inc  a corporation located in knoxville  tennessee  and controlled and majority owned by the aunt of the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
we paid approximately million to tec com for such services pursuant to the terms of the contract between the parties in  million in and million in the contract was renewed june   on substantially the same terms as the previous contract and expires june  we believe that the terms of this contract are consistent with third party arrangements that provide similar services 
as a matter of corporate governance policy and practice  related party transactions are presented and considered by the corporate governance committee of our board of directors 
forward looking statements the statements contained in this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements as that term is defined in section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements may pertain to  among other things  financial results  capital expenditures  drilling activity  development activities  cost savings  production efforts and volumes  hydrocarbon reserves  hydrocarbon prices  cash flows  available borrowing capacity  liquidity  acquisition plans  regulatory matters  and competition 
such forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as plan  future  estimate  expect  budget  predict  anticipate  projected  should  believe  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes 
such forward looking information is based upon management s current plans  expectations  estimates  and assumptions  upon current market conditions  and upon engineering and geologic information available at this time  and is subject to change and to a number of risks and uncertainties  and  therefore  actual results may differ materially from those projected 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are volatility in oil and natural gas prices  availability of services and supplies  disruption of operations and damages due to hurricanes or tropical storms  fluctuations of the prices received or demand for our oil and natural gas  the uncertainty of drilling results and reserve estimates  operating hazards  requirements for and availability of capital  conditions in the financial and credit markets  general economic conditions  changes in geologic or engineering information  changes in market conditions  competition and government regulations  as well as the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report and set forth from time to time in our other public reports  filings  and public statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
significant declines in oil and natural gas prices began in the last half of  and such pricing volatility has continued in with some improvement in the second half of our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
we do not utilize these agreements and financial instruments for trading and only enter into derivative agreements with banks in our credit facility 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
price collars at december  we had in place price collars in effect for the january through the march contract months for natural gas 
the natural gas price collars cover notional volumes of  mmbtu per month with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu and notional volumes of  mmbtu per month at a weighted average cap price of per mmbtu 
the fair value of these instruments at december  was an asset of less than million and is recognized on the accompanying balance sheet in other current assets 
there may be additional cash outflows for these price collars  as no cash premium was paid at inception of the hedge 
it is possible that we may recognize a loss on our statement of operations from these price collars during the first quarter of though the amount is unknown due to the variability of natural gas prices 
price floors between october and december we entered into additional price floors 
these floors cover additional natural gas production of  mmbtu from january through march and  mmbtu from april through june with strike prices ranging between and 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes and senior subordinated notes both have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had no borrowings under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows based on this same level of borrowing 
income tax carryforwards 
as of december   the company has net tax carryforwards assets of million for federal net operating losses  for federal alternative minimum tax credits and million for state tax net operating loss carryforwards which in management s judgment will more likely than not be utilized to offset future taxable earnings 
the company s new zealand subsidiaries have local income tax loss carryovers which are available if any future income is generated by these entities 
as of december  the estimated us dollar value of these loss carryover assets is million 
in management s judgment it is less than more likely than not that the remaining carryover assets will be utilized 
accordingly  these carryover assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and senior notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair value of our senior notes due  were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value  respectfully 
based upon quoted market prices as of december   the fair values of our senior notes due were million  or of face value 
based upon quoted market prices as of december   the fair values of our senior notes due were million  or of face value 
the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  and the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
continued volatility in both credit and commodity markets may reduce the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers from certain customers we also obtain letters of credit  parent company guaranties if applicable  and other collateral as considered necessary to reduce risk of loss 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
