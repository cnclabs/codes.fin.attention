msmf is licensed as a small business investment company sbic by the united states small business administration sba and the investment manager acts as msmf s manager and investment adviser 
because the investment manager  which employs all of the executive officers and other employees of mscc  is wholly owned by us  we do not pay any external investment advisory fees  but instead we incur the net operating costs associated with employing investment and portfolio management professionals through the investment manager 
the transactions discussed above were consummated in october and are collectively termed the formation transactions 
immediately following the formation transactions  main street equity interests  inc msei was formed as a wholly owned consolidated subsidiary of mscc 
msei has elected for tax purposes to be treated as a taxable entity and is taxed at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income 
on january   mscc consummated transactions the exchange offer to exchange  shares of its common stock for approximately of the total dollar value of the limited partner interests in main street capital ii  lp msc ii and  together with msmf  the funds 
pursuant to the terms of the exchange offer  of the membership interests in the general partner of msc ii  main street capital ii gp  llc msc ii gp  were also transferred to mscc for no consideration 
msc ii commenced operations in january  is an investment fund that operates as an sbic and is also managed by the investment manager 
the exchange offer and related transactions  including the transfer of the msc ii gp interests  are collectively termed the exchange offer transactions 
unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise indicates  the terms we  us  our and main street refer to mscc and its subsidiaries  including msmf and msmf gp  prior to the exchange offer transactions and mscc and its subsidiaries  including msmf  msmf gp  msc ii and msc ii gp  subsequent to the exchange offer transactions 
overview we are a principal investment firm focused on providing customized debt and equity financing to lower middle market companies  which we generally define as companies with annual revenues between million and million that operate in diverse industries 
we invest primarily in secured debt instruments  equity investments  warrants and other securities of lower middle market companies based in the united states 
our principal investment objective is to maximize our portfolio s total return by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity and equity related investments  including warrants  convertible securities and other rights to acquire equity securities in a portfolio company 
our core portfolio investments generally range in size from million to million 

table of contents our investments are generally made through mscc and the funds 
since the ipo  mscc and msmf have co invested in substantially every investment we have made 
in addition  approximately of the msc ii portfolio investments as of the date of the exchange offer represented co investments with mscc and or msmf 
mscc and the funds share the same investment strategies and criteria in the lower middle market  although they are subject to different regulatory regimes 
an investor s return in mscc will depend  in part  on the funds investment returns as msmf is a wholly owned subsidiary of mscc and msc ii is a majority owned subsidiary of mscc subsequent to the exchange offer 
we seek to fill the current financing gap for lower middle market businesses  which  historically  have had more limited access to financing from commercial banks and other traditional sources 
given the current credit environment  we believe the limited access to financing for lower middle market companies is even more pronounced 
the underserved nature of the lower middle market creates the opportunity for us to meet the financing needs of lower middle market companies while also negotiating favorable transaction terms and equity participations 
our ability to invest across a company s capital structure  from senior secured loans to equity securities  allows us to offer portfolio companies a comprehensive suite of financing solutions  or one stop financing 
providing customized  one stop financing solutions has become even more relevant to our portfolio companies in the current credit environment 
we generally seek to partner directly with entrepreneurs  management teams and business owners in making our investments 
main street believes that its core investment strategy has a lower correlation to the broader debt and equity markets 
the level of new portfolio investment activity will fluctuate from period to period based upon our view of the current economic fundamentals  our ability to identify new investment opportunities that meet our investment criteria  and our ability to consummate identified opportunities 
the level of new investment activity  and associated interest and fee income  will directly impact future investment income 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by portfolio companies and the portion of our portfolio debt investments on non accrual status will directly impact future investment income 
while we intend to grow our portfolio and our investment income over the long term  our growth and our operating results may be more limited during depressed economic periods 
however  we intend to appropriately manage our cost structure and liquidity position based on applicable economic conditions and our investment outlook 
the level of realized gains or losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation will also fluctuate depending upon portfolio activity and the performance of our individual portfolio companies 
the changes in realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation or depreciation could have a material impact on our operating results 
during  we paid monthly dividends of per share  or per share for the entire year 
for tax purposes  the monthly dividend paid in january was applied against the taxable income distribution requirements since it was declared and accrued prior to december  we generated undistributed taxable income or spillover income of approximately million  or per share  during that was carried forward toward distributions paid in for the calendar year  the dividends paid of per share represented an increase of over the total dividends of per share paid during calendar year in december  we declared monthly dividends for the first quarter of totaling per share 
in march  we declared monthly dividends for the second quarter of totaling per share 
including the dividends declared for the first and second quarters of  we will have paid approximately per share in cumulative dividends since our october initial public offering 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and idle funds investments 
in january  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
due to our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and idle funds investments  and available leverage  we expect to have sufficient cash resources to support our investment and operational activities through all of calendar year however  this projection will be impacted by  among other things  the pace of new and follow on investments  debt repayments and investment redemptions  the level of cash flow from operations and cash flow from realized gains  and the level of dividends we pay in cash 

table of contents the american recovery and reinvestment act of enacted in february the stimulus bill contains several provisions applicable to sbic funds  including the funds 
one of the key sbic related provisions included in the stimulus bill increased the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds 
the prior maximum amount of sbic leverage available to affiliated sbic funds was approximately million 
since the increase in the sbic leverage cap applies to affiliated sbic funds  main street is required to allocate such increased borrowing capacity between the funds 
subsequent to the exchange offer  main street now has access to an incremental million in sbic leverage capacity  subject to the required capitalization of each of the funds  in addition to the million of existing msc ii sbic leverage and the million of msmf sbic leverage 
a recently proposed bill  the small business financing and investment act of  or hr  would increase the total sbic leverage capacity for the funds from million to million 
if enacted  this bill would increase main street s sbic leverage capacity through the funds by an additional million 
in our view  the sbic leverage  including the increased capacity  remains a strategic advantage due to its long term  flexible structure and a low fixed cost 
the sbic leverage also provides proper matching of duration and cost compared with our core portfolio investments 
as of december   the weighted average duration of our core portfolio debt investments was approximately years compared to a weighted average duration of years for our sbic leverage 
as of december   approximately of core portfolio debt investments bear interest at fixed rates which is also appropriately matched by the long term  low cost fixed rates available through our sbic leverage 
in addition  we believe the embedded value of our sbic leverage would be significant if we adopted the fair value option provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification codification or asc  financial instruments  relating to accounting for debt obligations at their fair value 
critical accounting policies basis of presentation our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
for the years ended december  and  the consolidated financial statements of main street include the accounts of mscc  msmf  msei and msmf gp 
the investment manager is accounted for as a portfolio investment 
marketable securities and idle funds investments are classified as financial instruments and are reported separately on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated schedule of investments due to the nature of such investments 
to allow for more relevant disclosure of our core investment portfolio  core portfolio investments  as used herein  refers to all of our portfolio investments excluding the investment manager and marketable securities and idle funds investments 
main street s results of operations and cash flows for the years ended december    and  and financial positions as of december  and  are presented on a consolidated basis 
the effects of all intercompany transactions between main street and its subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation 
under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to article of regulation s x and the audit and accounting guide for investment companies issued by the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa guide  we are precluded from consolidating portfolio company investments  including those in which we have a controlling interest  unless the portfolio company is another investment company 
an exception to this general principle in the aicpa guide occurs if we own a controlled operating company that provides all or substantially all of its services directly to us  or to an investment company of ours 
none of the investments made by us qualify for this exception 
therefore  our portfolio investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value  as discussed further in note b to our consolidated financial statements  with any adjustments to fair value recognized as net change in unrealized appreciation depreciation from investments on our statement of operations until the investment is disposed of  resulting in any gain or loss on exit being recognized as a net realized gain loss from investments 

table of contents portfolio investment valuation the most significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements is the valuation of our portfolio investments and the related amounts of unrealized appreciation and depreciation 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at fair value including the investment in the investment manager 
we are required to report our investments at fair value 
we adopted the provisions of asc  fair value measurements and disclosures in the first quarter of asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the quality of inputs used to measure fair value  and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measurements 
our core business plan calls for us to invest primarily in illiquid securities issued by private companies 
these core portfolio investments may be subject to restrictions on resale and will generally have no established trading market 
as a result  we determine in good faith the fair value of our portfolio investments pursuant to a valuation policy in accordance with asc and a valuation process approved by our board of directors and in accordance with the act 
we review external events  including private mergers  sales and acquisitions involving comparable companies  and include these events in the valuation process 
our valuation policy and process are intended to provide a consistent basis for determining the fair value of the portfolio 
for valuation purposes  control investments are composed of equity and debt securities for which we have a controlling interest in the portfolio company or have the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company s board of directors 
market quotations are generally not readily available for our control investments 
as a result  we determine the fair value of control investments using a combination of market and income approaches 
under the market approach  we will typically use the enterprise value methodology to determine the fair value of these investments 
the enterprise value is the fair value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties  other than through a forced or liquidation sale 
typically  private companies are bought and sold based on multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  cash flows  net income  revenues  or in limited cases  book value 
there is no single methodology for estimating enterprise value 
for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is generally described as a range of values from which a single estimate of enterprise value is derived 
in estimating the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze various factors  including the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results 
we allocate the enterprise value to investments in order of the legal priority of the investments 
we will also use the income approach to determine the fair value of these securities  based on projections of the discounted future free cash flows that the portfolio company or the debt security will likely generate 
the valuation approaches for our control investments estimate the value of the investment if we were to sell  or exit  the investment  assuming the highest and best use of the investment by market participants 
in addition  these valuation approaches consider the value associated with our ability to control the capital structure of the portfolio company  as well as the timing of a potential exit 
for valuation purposes  non control investments are composed of debt and equity securities for which we do not have a controlling interest in the portfolio company  or the ability to nominate a majority of the portfolio company s board of directors 
market quotations for our non control investments are generally not readily available 
for our non control investments  we use a combination of the market and income approaches to value our equity investments and the income approach to value our debt instruments 
for non control debt investments  we determine the fair value primarily using a yield approach that analyzes the discounted cash flows of interest and principal for the debt security  as set forth in the associated loan agreements  as well as the financial position and credit risk of each of these portfolio investments 
our estimate of the expected repayment date of a debt security is generally the legal maturity date of the instrument  as we generally intend to hold our loans to maturity 
the yield analysis considers changes in leverage levels  credit quality  portfolio company performance and other factors 
we will use the value determined by the yield analysis as the fair value for that security  however  because of our general intent to hold our loans to maturity  the fair value will not exceed the face amount of the debt security 
a change in the assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our debt securities using the yield analysis could 
table of contents have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
if there is deterioration in credit quality or a debt security is in workout status  we may consider other factors in determining the fair value of a debt security  including the value attributable to the debt security from the enterprise value of the portfolio company or the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis 
due to the inherent uncertainty in the valuation process  our estimate of fair value may differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed 
in addition  changes in the market environment  portfolio company performance and other events that may occur over the lives of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be materially different than the valuations currently assigned 
we determine the fair value of each individual investment and record changes in fair value as unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
revenue recognition interest and dividend income we record interest and dividend income on the accrual basis to the extent amounts are expected to be collected 
dividend income is recorded as dividends are declared or at the point an obligation exists for the portfolio company to make a distribution 
in accordance with our valuation policy  we evaluate accrued interest and dividend income periodically for collectability 
when a loan or debt security becomes days or more past due  and if we otherwise do not expect the debtor to be able to service all of its debt or other obligations  we will generally place the loan or debt security on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan or debt security until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and intent to pay contractual amounts due 
if a loan or debt security s status significantly improves regarding ability to service the debt or other obligations  or if a loan or debt security is fully impaired  sold or written off  we will remove it from non accrual status 
fee income we may periodically provide services  including structuring and advisory services  to our portfolio companies 
for services that are separately identifiable and evidence exists to substantiate fair value  income is recognized as earned  which is generally when the investment or other applicable transaction closes 
fees received in connection with debt financing transactions for services that do not meet these criteria are treated as debt origination fees and are accreted into interest income over the life of the financing 
payment in kind pik interest while not significant to our total core debt investment portfolio  we currently hold several loans in our core portfolio that contain pik interest provisions 
the pik interest  computed at the contractual rate specified in each loan agreement  is added to the principal balance of the loan and recorded as interest income 
to maintain regulated investment company ric tax treatment as discussed below  this non cash source of income will need to be paid out to stockholders in the form of distributions  even though we may not have collected the pik interest in cash 
we will stop accruing pik interest and write off any accrued and uncollected interest when it is determined that pik interest is no longer collectible 
share based compensation we account for our share based compensation plans using the fair value method  as prescribed by asc  compensation stock compensation 
accordingly  for restricted stock awards  we measured the grant date fair value based upon the market price of our common stock on the date of the grant and will amortize this fair value to share based compensation expense over the requisite service period or vesting term 
income taxes mscc has elected and intends to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  and  among other things  intends to make 
table of contents the required distributions to our stockholders as specified therein 
as a ric  we generally will not pay corporate level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders as dividends 
depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year  we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and pay a excise tax on such income 
any such carryover taxable income must be distributed through a dividend declared prior to filing the final tax return related to the year which generated such taxable income 
mscc s wholly owned subsidiary  msei  is a taxable entity which holds certain of our core portfolio investments 
msei is consolidated for us gaap reporting purposes  and the core portfolio investments held by msei are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the principal purpose of msei is to permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through entities for tax purposes in order to comply with the source income requirements contained in the ric tax provisions 
msei is not consolidated with main street for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense or income tax benefit as a result of msei s ownership of certain core portfolio investments 
this income tax expense or benefit  if any  is reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
msei uses the liability method in accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  using statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
core portfolio composition core portfolio investments principally consist of secured debt  equity warrants and direct equity investments in privately held companies 
the core debt investments are secured by either a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company  generally bear interest at fixed rates  and generally mature between five and seven years from the original investment 
in most portfolio companies  we also receive nominally priced equity warrants and or make direct equity investments  usually in connection with a debt investment 
the investment manager is a wholly owned subsidiary of mscc 
however  the investment manager is accounted for as a portfolio investment of main street  since it conducts a significant portion of its investment management activities outside of mscc and its subsidiaries 
to allow for more relevant disclosure of our core investment portfolio  our investment in the investment manager has been excluded from the tables and amounts set forth below 
summaries of the composition of our core investment portfolio at cost and fair value as a percentage of total core portfolio investments are shown in the following table cost december  december  first lien debt equity second lien debt equity warrants fair value december  december  first lien debt equity equity warrants second lien debt 
table of contents the following table shows the core portfolio composition by geographic region of the united states at cost and fair value as a percentage of total core portfolio investments

table of contents fair value december  december  precast concrete manufacturing professional services health care services agricultural services industrial services retail transportation logistics electronics manufacturing restaurant industrial equipment metal fabrication information services manufacturing custom wood products health care products equipment rental governmental services distribution infrastructure products our core portfolio investments carry a number of risks including  but not limited to investing in lower middle market companies which may have a limited operating history and financial resources  holding investments that are not publicly traded and which may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale  and other risks common to investing in below investment grade debt and equity investments in private  lower middle market companies 
core portfolio asset quality we utilize an internally developed investment rating system to rate the performance of each core portfolio company 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is performing in a manner which significantly exceeds expectations and projections 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that  in general  is performing above expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is generally performing in accordance with expectations 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is underperforming expectations 
investments with such a rating require increased main street monitoring and scrutiny 
investment rating represents a portfolio company that is significantly underperforming 
investments with such a rating require heightened levels of main street monitoring and scrutiny and involve the recognition of significant unrealized depreciation on such investment 
all new core portfolio investments receive an initial rating 

table of contents the following table shows the distribution of our core investments on our to investment rating scale at fair value as of december  and december  december  investment rating investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio dollars in thousands totals based upon our investment rating system  the weighted average rating of our portfolio as of december  and was approximately as of december  and  we had three investments and one investment  respectively  on non accrual status comprising approximately and  respectively  of the total portfolio investments at fair value for each year then ended excluding main street s investment in the investment manager 
the broader fundamentals of the united states economy remain at depressed levels 
unemployment levels remain elevated and consumer fundamentals remain depressed  which has led to reductions in spending by both consumers and businesses 
in the event that the united states economy remains depressed  it is likely that the financial results of small to mid sized companies  like those in which we invest  could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in defaults 
in addition  the end markets for certain of our portfolio companies products and services have experienced negative economic trends 
we are seeing reduced operating results at several portfolio companies due to the general economic difficulties 
consequently  we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by these economic or other conditions  which could also have a negative impact on our future results

investment income for the year ended december   total investment income was million  a million  or  decrease over the million of total investment income for the year ended december  this comparable period decrease was principally attributable to i lower dividend income of million due to certain portfolio companies retaining their excess cash flow as additional cushion given reduced economic visibility and lower near term earnings expectations and ii reduced levels of fee income of million due to lower new investment originations  partially offset by higher interest income of million from core portfolio debt investments and from marketable securities and idle funds investments on higher average levels of such investments

capital resources as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and idle funds investments  and our net assets totaled million  or per share 
in january  we completed a follow on public stock offering in which we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
on october   main street entered into a million investment credit facility the investment facility with branch banking and trust company bb t and compass bank  as lenders  and bb t  as administrative agent for the lenders 
the purpose of the investment facility is to provide additional liquidity in support of future investment and operational activities 
the investment facility allows for an increase in the total size of the facility up to million  subject to certain conditions  and has a maturity date of october  borrowings under the investment facility bear interest  subject to main street s election  on a per annum basis equal to i the applicable libor rate plus or ii the applicable base rate plus 
main street pays unused commitment fees of per annum on the average unused lender commitments under the investment facility 
the investment facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants  including but not limited to i maintaining a minimum liquidity of not less than of the aggregate principal amount outstanding  ii maintaining an interest coverage ratio of at least to  and iii maintaining a minimum tangible net worth 
at december   main street had no borrowings outstanding under the investment facility  and main street was in compliance with the required financial covenants of the investment facility 
due to each of the funds status as a licensed sbic  we have the ability to issue  through the funds  debentures guaranteed by the sba at favorable interest rates 
under the regulations applicable to sbic funds  an sbic can have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba generally in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital  which effectively approximates the amount of its equity capital 
debentures guaranteed by the sba have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing year treasury note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity but may be pre paid at any time 
debentures issued prior to september were subject to pre payment penalties during their first five years 
those pre payment penalties no longer apply to debentures issued after september  on december   we  through msmf  had million of outstanding indebtedness guaranteed by the sba  which carried an average fixed interest rate of approximately 
the first maturity related to the sbic debentures does not occur until  and the weighted average duration is years as of december  the stimulus bill contains several provisions applicable to sbic funds  including the funds 
one of the key sbic related provisions included in the stimulus bill increased the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds 
the prior maximum amount of sbic leverage available to affiliated sbic funds was approximately million 
since the increase in the sbic leverage cap applies to affiliated sbic funds  main street is required to allocate such increased borrowing capacity between the funds 
subsequent to the exchange offer  main street now has access to an incremental million in sbic leverage capacity  subject to the required capitalization of each of the funds  in addition to the million of existing msc ii sbic leverage and the million of msmf sbic leverage 

table of contents a recently proposed bill  the small business financing and investment act of  or hr  would increase the total sbic leverage capacity for the funds from million to million 
if enacted  this bill would increase main street s sbic leverage capacity through the funds by an additional million 
due to our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and idle funds investments and the available borrowing capacity through both the sbic program and the investment facility  we project that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our investment and operational activities through all of calendar year however  this projection will be impacted by  among other things  the pace of new and follow on investments  debt repayments and investment redemptions  the level of cash flow from operations and cash flow from realized gains  and the level of dividends we pay in cash 
we anticipate that we will continue to fund our investment activities through existing cash and cash equivalents  the liquidation of marketable securities and idle funds investments  and a combination of future debt and equity capital 
our primary uses of funds will be investments in portfolio companies  operating expenses and cash distributions to holders of our common stock 
we periodically invest excess cash balances into marketable securities and idle funds investments 
the investment objective of marketable securities and idle funds investments is to generate incremental cash returns on excess cash balances prior to utilizing those funds for investment in our core portfolio investment strategy 
marketable securities and idle funds investments generally consist of secured debt investments  independently rated debt investments  certificates of deposit with financial institutions  and diversified bond funds 
the composition of marketable securities and idle funds investments will vary in a given period based upon  among other things  changes in market conditions  the underlying fundamentals in our marketable securities and idle funds investments  our outlook regarding future core portfolio investment needs  and any regulatory requirements applicable to main street 
if our common stock trades below our net asset value per share  we will generally not be able to issue additional common stock at the market price unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our board of directors makes certain determinations 
a proposal  approved by our stockholders at our june annual meeting of stockholders  authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share of our common stock in one or more offerings for a period of one year ending on the earlier of june  or the date of our annual meeting of stockholders 
we would need approval of a similar proposal by our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval 
in order to satisfy the code requirements applicable to a ric  we intend to distribute to our stockholders substantially all of our taxable income  but we may also elect to periodically spillover certain excess undistributed taxable income from one tax year into the next tax year 
in addition  as a bdc  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which include borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
in january  we received exemptive relief from the sec that permits us to exclude sba guaranteed debt issued by our wholly owned sbic subsidiary  msmf  from our asset coverage ratio  which  in turn  enables us to fund more investments with debt capital 
we expect to have similar relief from the sec with respect to sbic debt securities issued by msc ii  including the million of currently outstanding debt related to its participation in the sbic program 
on december   we entered into a treasury based credit facility the treasury facility with wachovia bank  national association and bb t  as administrative agent for the lenders 
the purpose of the treasury facility was to provide flexibility in the sizing of core portfolio investments and to facilitate the growth of our core investment portfolio 
however  due to the maturation of our core investment portfolio and the additional flexibility provided by the investment facility  we unilaterally terminated the treasury facility on july  in order to eliminate the unused commitment fees that would have been paid under this facility over its remaining term 

table of contents current market conditions the broader fundamentals of the united states economy remain at depressed levels 
unemployment levels remain elevated and consumer fundamentals remain depressed  which has led to significant reductions in spending by both consumers and businesses 
although we have been able to secure access to additional liquidity  including our recent public stock offering  the million investment facility  and the increase in available leverage through the sbic program as part of the stimulus bill  there is no assurance that debt or equity capital will be available to us in the future on favorable terms  or at all 
the deterioration in consumer confidence and a general reduction in spending by both consumers and businesses has had an adverse effect on a number of the industries in which some of our portfolio companies operate 
the results of some of the lower middle market companies like those in which we invest  may continue to experience deterioration  which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in their defaults 
in addition  the end markets for certain of our portfolio companies products and services have experienced negative economic trends 
we can provide no assurance that the performance of our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic or other conditions  which could have a negative impact on our future results

in october  the fasb amended asc with asc a  financial assets in a market that is not active  to provide an illustrative example of how to determine the fair value of a financial asset in an inactive market 
asc a does not change the fair value measurement principles previously set forth 
since adopting asc in january  our practices for determining the fair value of our investment portfolio and financial instruments have been  and continue to be  consistent with the guidance provided in asc a 
therefore  our adoption of the update did not affect our practices for determining the fair value of our investment portfolio and financial instruments  and our adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

the codification reorganized the literature and changed the naming mechanism by which topics are referenced 
asc was effective for us during our interim period ended september  as required  references to pre codification accounting literature have been changed throughout this annual report on form k to appropriately reference the codification 
our accounting policies and amounts presented in the financial statements were not impacted by this change 
inflation inflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations in any of the reporting periods presented in this report 
however  our portfolio companies have experienced  and may in the future experience  the impacts of inflation on their operating results  including periodic escalations in their costs for raw materials and required energy consumption 
off balance sheet arrangements we may be a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
at december   we had three outstanding commitments to fund unused revolving loans for up to  in total 
contractual obligations as of december   our future fixed commitments for cash payments on contractual obligations for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows total and thereafter dollars in thousands sbic debentures payable interest due on sbic debentures total mscc is obligated to make payments under a support services agreement with the investment manager 
subsequent to the completion of the formation transactions and the ipo  the investment manager is reimbursed for its excess cash expenses associated with providing investment management and other services to mscc and its subsidiaries  as well as msc ii and third parties 
each quarter  as part of the support services agreement  mscc makes payments to cover all cash expenses incurred by the investment manager  less the recurring management fees that the investment manager receives from msc ii pursuant to a 
table of contents long term investment advisory services agreement and any other fees received from third parties for providing external services 
related party transactions we co invested with msc ii in several existing portfolio investments prior to the formation transactions  but did not co invest with msc ii subsequent to the formation transactions and prior to june in june  we received exemptive relief from the sec to allow us to resume co investing with msc ii in accordance with the terms of such exemptive relief 
the co investments among us and msc ii have all been made at the same time and on the same terms and conditions 
the co investments were also made in accordance with the investment manager s conflicts policy and in accordance with the applicable sbic conflict of interest regulations 
msc ii is managed by the investment manager  and the investment manager is wholly owned by us 
in january  pursuant to the exchange offer transactions  we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for approximately of the total dollar value of the limited partner interests in msc ii 
as discussed further in note d to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  subsequent to the completion of the formation transactions  the investment manager is a wholly owned portfolio company of mscc 
at december  and  the investment manager had a receivable of  and  respectively  with mscc related to net cash expenses incurred by the investment manager required to support main street s business 
recent developments exchange offer transactions on january   mscc consummated the exchange offer to exchange  shares the exchange shares of its common stock for approximately of the total dollar value of the limited partner interests in msc ii 
pursuant to the terms of the exchange offer  of the membership interests in msc ii gp were also transferred to mscc for no consideration 
msc ii commenced operations in january  is an investment fund that operates as an sbic and is managed by the investment manager pursuant to a separate investment advisory services agreement 
the exchange offer was applicable to all msc ii limited partner interests except for any limited partner interests owned by affiliates of mscc  including any limited partner interests owned by officers or directors of mscc 
the exchange offer was formally approved by the sba prior to closing 
the exchange shares are subject to a one year contractual lock up from the exchange offer closing date 
an approximately minority ownership in the total dollar value of the msc ii limited partnership interests remains outstanding  including approximately owned by affiliates of mscc 
as of the closing date of the exchange offer  msc ii had million of sbic debentures outstanding  which are guaranteed by the sba and carry an average fixed interest rate of approximately 
the first principal maturity related to msc ii s sbic debentures does not occur until consummation of the exchange offer transactions provides main street with access to additional long term  low cost leverage capacity through the sbic program 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of enacted in february the stimulus bill increased the maximum amount of combined sbic leverage or sbic leverage cap to million for affiliated sbic funds from the previous sbic leverage cap of approximately million 
since the increase in the sbic leverage cap applies to affiliated sbic funds  main street is required to allocate such increased borrowing capacity between msmf and msc ii 
subsequent to the exchange offer  main street now has access to an incremental million in sbic leverage capacity  subject to the required capitalization of each of the funds  in addition to the million of existing msc ii sbic leverage and the million of sbic leverage at msmf 
at the closing of the exchange offer  main street funded approximately million in unfunded limited partner commitments for the limited partner interests it acquired in connection with the exchange offer in order to comply with sba regulatory requirements  which was funded by main street in part with approximately 
table of contents million drawn down under its million investment credit facility 
we currently project that consummation of the exchange offer transactions will be accretive to our calendar year distributable net investment income per share 
equity offering subsequent to the exchange offer in january  we completed a public stock offering consisting of the public offering and sale of  shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of the over allotment option  at a price to the public of per share  resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriters commissions and offering costs 
based upon the net proceeds from this offering and existing cash  marketable securities  and idle funds investments  we estimate that we have the required capitalization to access all of the million in incremental sbic leverage available through the sbic funds 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding debt borrowed under our million investment credit facility to fund msc ii capital commitments assumed in the exchange offer 
we intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering to make investments in lower middle market companies in accordance with our investment objective and strategies  pay operating expenses and other cash obligations and for general corporate purposes 
pending such uses  we may invest the net proceeds of this offering primarily in marketable securities and idle funds investments  which may include investments in secured intermediate term bank debt and other independently rated debt investments 
other during january  we sold our investment in quest design and production  llc quest  which was on non accrual status as of december  we had recorded unrealized depreciation as of december  on our investment in quest equal to the million loss we will realize in the first quarter of related to the exit of this investment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments  marketable securities  and idle funds investments 
our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks 
our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates  to the extent of any debt investments that include floating interest rates 
the significant majority of our debt investments are made with fixed interest rates for the term of the investment 
however  as of december   approximately of our core debt investment portfolio at cost bore interest at floating rates with of those floating rate debt investments at cost subject to contractual minimum interest rates 
the long term interest rates on our outstanding indebtedness are fixed for the year life of such debt 
as of december   we had not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements 
at december   based on our applicable levels of floating rate debt investments  a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our level of interest income from debt investments
