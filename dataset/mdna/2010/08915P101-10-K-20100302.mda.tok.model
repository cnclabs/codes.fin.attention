executive summary the economic recession and uncertainty in the financial sector have resulted in a difficult environment for retailers 
if measures implemented  or to be implemented  by the federal and state governments or private sector spending fail to stimulate an economic recovery  this economic recession could continue 
while our results for fiscal  and reflect this recession  our results improved in fiscal compared with fiscal net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal the increase was driven primarily by higher sales levels  and a decrease in selling and administrative expense and interest expense as a percent of net sales

the increase in new store sales reflected the opening of new stores  net of closures and relocations  since december  same store sales decreased for fiscal compared with fiscal our net sales were also negatively impacted by weakness in the performance of the roller shoe product category  which declined million from the prior year

the provision for income taxes was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal  reflecting our lower pre tax income 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal compared with for fiscal our lower effective tax rate for fiscal compared to the prior year primarily reflects the impact of lower pre tax income on income tax credits for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures and cash dividends 
we fund our liquidity requirements primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
we believe our cash on hand  future funds from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
we ended fiscal with million of cash and cash equivalents compared with million in fiscal we reduced our long term debt by million  or  during fiscal to million from million at the end of fiscal the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for each of the past three fiscal years fiscal year dollars in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents the seasonality of our business historically provides greater cash flow from operations during the holiday and winter selling season  with fourth fiscal quarter net sales traditionally generating the strongest profits of our fiscal year 
typically  we use operating cash flow and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund inventory increases in anticipation of the holidays and our inventory levels are at their highest in the months leading up to christmas 
as holiday sales significantly reduce inventory levels  this reduction  combined with net income  historically provides us with strong cash flow from operations at the end of our fiscal year 
our improved earnings contributed to higher cash flow from operations for fiscal compared to fiscal  which enabled us to continue to reduce our long term debt levels year over year 
because of the economic recession  in fiscal we significantly reduced our capital spending for new store openings from historical levels 
for fiscal we purchased lower quantities of inventory during the year to reduce our overall inventory levels in anticipation of weaker consumer demand resulting from the economic recession 
for fiscal we purchased larger quantities of inventory earlier in the year to insure adequate product availability for the holiday and winter selling season 
the higher inventory levels and timing of purchases combined with lower than anticipated sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal resulted in reduced operating cash flow for the year 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects higher net income for the year  lower receivables due to the timing of settlement of credit card receivables and increases in accrued expenses  offset by a reduced cash flow benefit resulting from lowered inventory levels 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects lower levels of merchandise inventory purchases to better align our inventory balances with weaker sales resulting from the economic recession  offset by lower net income in fiscal  reductions in accounts payable related to reduced inventory purchases and reduced accrued expenses primarily related to employee compensation and benefits and advertising expense 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures  excluding non cash acquisitions  represented substantially all of the net cash used in investing activities for each period 
capital expenditures were lower in fiscal due to substantially fewer new store openings 
our capital spending is primarily for new store openings  store related remodeling  distribution center and corporate headquarters costs and computer hardware and software purchases 
capital expenditures by category for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows fiscal year dollars in thousands new stores store related remodels distribution center computer hardware  software and other total capital spending in fiscal was lower than prior years as we conserved capital in response to the economic recession 
our capital expenditures for new stores included three new stores in fiscal  new stores  net of closures and relocations  in fiscal  and new stores  net of closures and relocations  in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal  and included amounts related to the implementation of computer system improvements and enhanced security measures to support our infrastructure 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal and was million and million  respectively  while net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was million 
for fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was used to pay down a significant portion of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we reduced our quarterly dividend payments to per share and did not repurchase stock in fiscal  in order to preserve capital during this economic recession 
for fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility  repurchase stock and pay dividends 
for fiscal  cash provided by borrowings under our revolving credit facility was used primarily to repurchase stock  pay dividends and fund working capital 
as of january   we had revolving credit borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our financing agreement 
these balances compare to borrowings of million and letter of credit commitments of million outstanding under our financing agreement as of december  our revolving credit facility balances have historically increased from the end of the first quarter to the end of the second quarter and from the end of the third quarter to the week of thanksgiving 
the historical increases in our revolving credit facility balances reflect the build up of inventory in anticipation of our summer and winter selling seasons 
revolving credit facility balances typically fall from the week of thanksgiving to the end of the fourth quarter  reflecting inventory sales during the holiday and winter selling season 
our revolving credit borrowings in fiscal were consistently below fiscal due primarily to improved operating results and substantially reduced cash used for new store openings in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our revolving credit facility balance declined in line with our historical trends after increasing in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to lower than anticipated sales levels 
quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid in fiscal and due to the economic recession  in the first quarter of fiscal our board of directors reduced the quarterly cash dividend to per share of outstanding common stock for an annual rate of per share  and quarterly dividend payments of per share were paid in fiscal this decision was consistent with our objective to utilize capital to maintain a healthy financial condition during the economic recession 
in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  periodically  we repurchase our common stock in the open market pursuant to programs approved by our board of directors 
depending on business conditions  we may repurchase our common stock for a variety of reasons  including the current market price of our stock  to offset dilution related to equity based compensation plans and to optimize our capital structure 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
under this program  we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock for million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  at which time the program was completed 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized an additional share repurchase program for the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
under the authorization  we may purchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the applicable rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec 
however  the timing and amount of such purchases  if any  would be at the discretion of management  and would depend upon market conditions and other considerations 
in light of the economic climate  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under this program during fiscal we repurchased  and  shares of our common stock under this program for million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
since the inception of our initial share repurchase program in may through january   we have repurchased a total of  shares for million  leaving a total of million available for share repurchases under our current share repurchase program 
we expect limited  if any  share repurchases in fiscal our dividend payments and stock repurchases are generally funded by distributions from our subsidiary  big corp 
generally  as long as there is no default or event of default under our financing agreement  big corp 
may make distributions to us of up to million per year and up to million per quarter for any purpose including dividend payments or stock repurchases and may make additional distributions for the purpose of paying our dividends or repurchasing our common stock if big corp 
will have post dividend liquidity as defined in the financing agreement of at least million 
financing agreement 
on december   we entered into a million financing agreement with the cit group business credit  inc cit and a syndicate of other lenders 
on may   we amended the financing agreement to  among other things  increase the line of credit to million 
in and the agreement was further amended to  among other things  adjust various definitions relating to borrowing availability under the agreement and revise certain covenants  including the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement 
the initial termination date of the revolving credit facility under the financing agreement is march  subject to annual extensions thereafter 
the revolving credit facility may be terminated by the lenders by giving at least days prior written notice before any anniversary date  commencing with its anniversary date on march  we may terminate the revolving credit facility by giving at least days prior written notice  provided that if we terminate prior to march   we must pay an early termination fee 
unless it is terminated  the revolving credit facility will continue on an annual basis from anniversary date to anniversary date beginning on march  under the revolving credit facility  our maximum eligible borrowing capacity is limited to of the aggregate value of eligible inventory during october  november and december and during the remainder of the year 
an annual fee of  payable monthly  is assessed on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
as of january  and december   our total remaining borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility  after subtracting letters of credit  was million and million  respectively 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at various rates based on our overall borrowings  with a floor of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate and a ceiling of libor plus or the jp morgan chase bank prime lending rate 
the following table provides information about borrowings under our revolving credit facility as of and for the periods indicated fiscal year dollars in thousands fiscal year end balance average interest rate maximum outstanding during the year average outstanding during the year our financing agreement is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our assets 
our financing agreement contains various financial and other covenants  including covenants that require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to in certain circumstances  restrict our ability to incur indebtedness or to create various liens and restrict the amount of capital expenditures that we may incur 
our financing agreement also restricts our ability to engage in mergers or acquisitions  sell assets  repurchase our stock or pay dividends 
we may repurchase our stock or declare a dividend only if  among other things  no default or event of default exists on the stock repurchase date or dividend declaration date  as applicable  and a default is not expected to result from the repurchase of stock or payment of the dividend and certain other criteria are met  as more fully described in part ii  item  market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities  of this annual report on form k 
the requirements are described in more detail in the financing agreement and the amendments thereto  which have been filed as exhibits to our previous filings with the sec 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants under our financing agreement 
if we fail to make any required payment under our financing agreement or if we otherwise default under this instrument  the lenders may i require us to agree to less favorable interest rates and other terms under the agreement in exchange for a waiver of any such default or ii accelerate our debt under this agreement 
this acceleration could also result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have outstanding at that time 
during the second half of fiscal  we intend to negotiate a new revolving credit financing agreement to replace our current financing agreement which has an initial termination date of march  we expect that our interest expense and amortization associated with financing fees will be higher in fiscal as a result of entering into a new financing agreement 
under our current financing agreement  the libor base borrowing option includes an interest rate range of libor plus to 
based on current market conditions  under a new revolving credit financing agreement the interest rate range is expected to increase by approximately basis points or more 
in addition  beginning in the first quarter of  our outstanding debt associated with our existing revolving credit facility will be classified as a current liability 
future capital requirements 
we had cash on hand of million at january  we expect capital expenditures for fiscal  excluding non cash acquisitions  to range from approximately million to million  primarily to fund the opening of new stores  store related remodeling  distribution center equipment and computer hardware and software purchases 
in light of the economic recession experienced in fiscal and fiscal  we slowed our store expansion efforts substantially in fiscal in comparison to previous years 
we anticipate opening between and net new stores in fiscal compared to three net new stores in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors reduced our quarterly cash dividend to per share of outstanding common stock  for an annual rate of per share 
in the first quarter of fiscal  our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of outstanding common stock  which will be paid on march  to stockholders of record as of march  as of february   a total of million remained available for share repurchases under our share repurchase program 
we consider several factors in determining when and if we make share repurchases including  among other things  our alternative cash requirements  existing business conditions and the market price of our stock 
due to the economic recession  we discontinued share repurchases in fiscal and expect limited  if any  share repurchases in fiscal we believe we will be able to fund our cash requirements  for at least the next twelve months  from cash on hand  operating cash flows and borrowings from our revolving credit facility 
however  our ability to satisfy our cash requirements depends upon our future performance  which in turn is subject to general economic conditions and regional risks  and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  including factors beyond our control 
there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to maintain our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our obligations and commitments  or if we are unable to maintain our ability to borrow sufficient amounts under our existing revolving credit facility  or successfully negotiate and enter into a new revolving credit facility to replace our current facility  which has an initial termination date of march   we will be required to refinance or restructure our indebtedness or raise additional debt or equity capital 
additionally  we may be required to sell material assets or operations  suspend or further reduce dividend payments or delay or forego expansion opportunities 
we might not be able to implement successful alternative strategies on satisfactory terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 
our material off balance sheet arrangements are operating lease obligations and letters of credit 
we excluded these items from the balance sheet in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap
