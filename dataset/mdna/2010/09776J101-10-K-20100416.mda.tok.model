item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general we compete in the department store segment of the us retail industry 
founded in  the company is one of the largest regional department store operators  offering a broad assortment of brand name fashion apparel and accessories for women  men and children as well as cosmetics  home furnishings and other goods 
we currently operate stores in states in the northeast  midwest and upper great plains under the bon ton  bergner s  boston store  carson pirie scott  elder beerman  herberger s and younkers nameplates and  in the detroit  michigan area  under the parisian nameplate  encompassing a total of approximately million square feet 
the company had net sales of billion in economic factors and company performance since september  the us economy has experienced  among other things  significant increases in unemployment  flat to falling consumer income levels  a tightening of credit availability and general reduction in household wealth 
the challenging credit markets and economic weakness and uncertainty have led to a substantial deterioration in consumer confidence and  we believe  consumer spending  impacting us as well as most other companies in our industry 
during  in light of the macroeconomic decline that adversely impacted our sales  we continued to focus on adjusting our cost structure and improving liquidity 
we implemented inventory management and cost reduction initiatives to appropriately size our business and improve our financial performance  benefits realized from these measures included increased gross profit dollars and decreased sg a expenses 
our improved performance contributed to increased cash flows from operations  which enabled us to significantly reduce our debt 
we are cautiously optimistic about the economic environment for we will continue to focus on sales and marketing initiatives to positively impact our sales performance  particularly when economic conditions improve  as well as assessing options to further reduce our cost structure 
assumptions in our projections include a comparable store sales performance ranging from flat to a increase  a gross margin rate of  consistent with the rate  a reduction of million to million in our sg a expenses  and an effective tax rate of 
new and amended credit facilities in an effort to provide the company with increased liquidity to support our growth  on november   we entered into a million second lien term loan credit facility the term loan facility  which will mature on november  proceeds from the transaction were used to increase liquidity by paying a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our loan and security agreement the revolving credit facility and to pay related fees and expenses 
see liquidity and capital resources  below  and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
on december   we entered into a million year senior secured amended and restated loan and security agreement the amended revolving credit facility  which will expire on june  the amended revolving credit facility replaced our existing million asset based revolving credit facility  which was scheduled to mature on march  the proceeds of the amended revolving credit facility were used to pay the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and will be used for other general corporate purposes 
see liquidity and capital resources  below  and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
results of operations the following table summarizes changes in our selected operating indicators  illustrating the relationship of various income and expense items to net sales for each year presented components may not add or subtract to totals because of rounding percent of net sales net sales other income costs and expenses costs of merchandise sold selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of lease related interests goodwill impairment other impairment charges income loss from operations interest expense  net loss income before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss income compared with net sales net sales in were  million  a decrease of from  million in comparable store sales decreased from the prior year 
we believe sales were depressed throughout the year primarily due to wavering consumer confidence and numerous economic factors that negatively impacted consumers discretionary spending 
additionally  due to inventory management efforts  there was significantly less clearance inventory throughout compared with the prior year  further challenging sales 
the best performing merchandise categories in the period were moderate sportswear included in women s apparel and accessories 
sales in moderate sportswear have benefited from what we believe is a shift in our customers spending patterns in response to the economic situation in as our moderate offerings provide the value our customers are seeking 
sales increases in accessories also reflect favorable customer response to trend right  value priced private brand and branded product 
similar success in sales of moderate goods was achieved throughout all families of business 
the poor performances of better sportswear included in women s apparel and furniture included in home also suggest our customers are spending their limited discretionary dollars on more moderately priced merchandise 
better sportswear was the most difficult business in women s apparel in  as economic conditions and the loss of several key branded vendors challenged sales 
furniture sales continue to be adversely impacted by the difficult housing market and continued deterioration in consumer spending for bigger ticket items 
other income other income  which includes income from revenues received under our credit card program agreement with hsbc  leased departments and other customer revenues  was million  or of net sales  in as compared with million  or of net sales  in the decrease was primarily due to reduced sales volume and reduced income associated with our proprietary credit card program 
proprietary credit card income decreased as a result of lower sales volume as well as an amendment to the credit card program agreement with hsbc 
other income was reduced by million in pursuant to the amended agreement with hsbc which revises the compensation the company receives for certain types of credit sales and provides that the company and hsbc will share certain losses associated with the credit card program 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
costs and expenses despite the decrease in sales volume  we effectively managed our inventory throughout the year such that gross margin dollars increased million to  million in  compared with  million in the increase in gross margin dollars reflects an improvement in the gross margin rate of basis points  primarily due to a reduction in the net markdown rate 
gross margin as a percentage of sales increased to in the current year from in the prior year 
sg a expense decreased million to million in as compared with  million in  reflecting the successful execution of our cost savings initiatives 
the decrease primarily resulted from expense reductions in payroll and advertising in response to our sales trend 
the expense rate in decreased basis points to of net sales  compared with in depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of lease related interests decreased million  to million in from million in  primarily due to the reduced asset base resulting from significant asset impairment charges recorded in the fourth quarter of and reduced capital expenditures 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of million to fully impair our goodwill 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we recorded million of non cash asset impairment charges which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store and distribution center properties 
we recorded charges of million for similar asset impairments in see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  we recorded non cash impairment charges of million related to the reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names

income loss from operations income from operations in was million  or of net sales  as compared with a loss from operations of million  or of net sales  in interest expense  net net interest expense in was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  in the million increase primarily reflects interest expense associated with interest rate swaps and the new term loan  deferred fees as a result of the amended and new credit facilities and the ineffectiveness of the interest rate swaps  partially offset by decreased borrowing levels and reduced interest rates in the first three quarters of income tax benefit provision an income tax benefit of million was recorded in  primarily due to deferred tax asset valuation allowance releases associated with implementation of the carry back provisions of the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of this compares favorably with an income tax provision of million in the income tax provision includes an unfavorable million tax expense adjustment in the fourth quarter of pursuant to establishment of an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and a favorable million tax benefit adjustment in the third quarter of related to expiration of certain exposures 
net loss the net loss in was million  or of net sales  as compared with a net loss of million  or of net sales  in compared with net sales net sales in decreased to  million from  million in comparable store sales decreased from the prior year 
we believe the comparable store sales decline reflects a confluence of factors that created an adverse economic environment throughout the year  particularly the last quarter of  which weakened consumer sentiment and pressured spending 
the best performing merchandise category in the period was children s apparel 
sales increases in this category primarily reflect expanded and improved product selection in branded playwear and outerwear 
the poorest performing categories in the period were furniture included in home and moderate sportswear and dresses both included in women s apparel 
furniture sales were impacted by the difficult housing market in new construction and existing home sales  and continued deterioration in consumer spending for more expensive items 
moderate sportswear and dresses have been impacted by the challenging economic environment  which has resulted in reduced consumer spending on discretionary items 
sales in moderate sportswear were also affected by the decision made in by certain of our key vendors to exit the moderate sportswear business 
it was not until the fall of that we began receiving merchandise from new  replacement vendors 
other income other income  which includes income from revenues received under our credit card program agreement with hsbc  leased departments and other customer revenues  was million  or of net sales  in as compared with million  or of net sales  in the decrease primarily reflects reduced sales volume in costs and expenses gross margin dollars in were  million as compared with  million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in gross margin dollars reflects the reduced sales volume and a decrease in the gross margin rate 
gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased basis points to in from in the decrease in the gross margin rate primarily reflects an increased net markdown rate in response to the challenging economic environment 
sg a expense in was  million as compared with  million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease primarily resulted from expense reductions in payroll  benefits and advertising in response to our sales trend 
other expense reductions were due to increased efficiencies in operations and store closing expenses 
despite the expense savings  the expense rate in increased basis points to of net sales  compared with in  due to the reduced sales volume 
in  depreciation and amortization expense and amortization of lease related interests increased million  to million  from million in we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of based upon our review  the fair value of our single reporting unit  estimated using a combination of our common stock trading value as of the end of the second quarter of  a discounted cash flow analysis and other generally accepted valuation methodologies  was less than the carrying amount 
there was no such charge in see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of non cash asset impairment charges which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store properties 
we recorded charges of million for asset impairments in see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  a review was completed of the value of certain intangible assets 
as a result of our assessment  we recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million related to the reduction in the value of four indefinite lived trade names and two indefinite lived private label brand names

loss income from operations the loss from operations in was million  or of net sales  as compared with income from operations of million  or of net sales  in interest expense  net net interest expense in was million  or of net sales  as compared with million  or of net sales  in the million decrease primarily reflects decreased borrowing levels and reduced interest rates in and million of expense incurred for the early extinguishment of debt in income tax provision the income tax provision reflects an effective tax rate of in  compared with in the income tax provision includes an unfavorable million tax expense adjustment in the fourth quarter of pursuant to establishment of an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and a favorable million tax benefit adjustment in the third quarter of related to expiration of certain exposures 
net loss income net loss in was million  or of net sales  as compared with net income of million  or of net sales  in liquidity and capital resources at january   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under our amended revolving credit facility before taking into account the minimum borrowing availability of million 
we generated significant operating cash flow in  allowing us to reduce our debt by million  or  and invest in business initiatives 
in anticipation of economic uncertainty in  we will continue our focus on effective cash management and maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity 
we have identified further opportunities for expense reductions and will continue to control inventory levels in order to benefit our working capital needs 
we anticipate these actions will positively impact our cash flow 
typically  cash flows from operations are impacted by consumer confidence  weather in the geographic markets served by the company  and economic and competitive conditions existing in the retail industry  a downturn in any single factor or a combination of factors could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to operate our business 
while the current economic uncertainty affects our assessment of short term liquidity  we consider our resources cash flows from operations supplemented by borrowings under the credit facility adequate to satisfy our cash needs 
while there can be no assurances  management believes there should be sufficient liquidity to cover our short term funding needs 
the following table summarizes material measures of our liquidity and capital resources january  january  february  dollars in millions working capital current ratio debt to total capitalization unused availability under lines of credit debt includes obligations under capital leases 
total capitalization includes shareholders equity and debt 
subject to a minimum borrowing availability covenant of million 
our primary sources of working capital are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our business follows a seasonal pattern  working capital fluctuates with seasonal variations  reaching its highest level in october or november to fund the purchase of merchandise inventories prior to the holiday season 
the seasonality of our business historically provides greatest cash flow from operations during the holiday season  with fourth fiscal quarter net sales generating the strongest profits of our fiscal year 
as holiday sales significantly reduce inventory levels  this reduction  combined with net income  historically provides us with strong cash flow from operations at the end of our fiscal year 
decreases in working capital and the current ratio in  as compared with  largely reflect a prior year federal income tax receivable of million included within prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as current year increases in accounts payable as a result of the timing of merchandise receipts and accrued payroll and benefits due to accruals for performance incentives and company matching retirement contributions 
the decrease in debt to total capitalization reflects cash flow generated in utilized to reduce debt levels 
the increase in unused availability under lines of credit as compared with the prior year primarily reflects decreases in direct borrowings and letters of credit 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility have decreased due to our improved operating performance  reduced capital expenditures and the impact of the term loan facility entered into in  which enabled us to increase liquidity by paying a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
working capital levels decreased minimally between and the increase in the current ratio in  as compared with  primarily reflects proportionately larger decreases in current liabilities as compared with current assets  principally due to reduced accrued liabilities relating to benefits 
the increase in debt to total capitalization is largely due to the significant decrease in shareholders equity in  the result of the net loss for the period and a decline in the funded status of the company s defined benefit pension plans 
the decrease in unused availability under lines of credit as compared with reflects decreased availability primarily due to reduced inventory levels and increased documentary letters of credit to support the purchasing of inventory 
cash provided by used in our operating  investing and financing activities is summarized as follows dollars in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects improvement in our business performance  resulting in the significant reduction to the current year loss  partially offset by decreased non cash charges 
additionally  analysis of working capital changes in the periods is impacted by the current year cash receipt of a prior year million income tax receivable 
the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in  as compared with  largely reflects a decrease in business performance  resulting in the loss compared with income  partially offset by increased non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization  impairment charges for long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  and the increase in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we invested million  million and million in capital expenditures not reduced by landlord contributions in  and  respectively 
these investments were for the opening  expanding and remodeling of stores and investments in information technology 
in and  we significantly reduced our capital expenditures in response to economic conditions 
in light of the continued uncertainty about the extent or continuation of these conditions  we remain focused on limiting capital expenditures to those projects that are either necessary for business operations or have an attractive expected rate of return 
we expect capital expenditures to total approximately million net of approximately million of landlord contributions in continued investment in information technology represents a significant portion of our planned capital expenditures 
the increase in net cash used in financing activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects utilization of cash flow to reduce debt in the decrease in net cash used in financing activities in  as compared with  primarily reflects net payments made to reduce debt in  the result of increased operating cash flows in that year

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and judgments that affected reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to merchandise returns  bad debts  inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  financings  contingencies  insurance reserves  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially lead to materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as described below 
for a discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margin is derived by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail inventory method is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
use of the retail inventory method will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are taken timely as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the retail inventory method calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markups  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly impact both the ending inventory valuation at cost and the resulting gross margin 
these significant estimates  coupled with the fact that the retail inventory method is an averaging process  can  under certain circumstances  result in individual inventory components with cost above related net realizable value 
factors that can lead to this result include applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that is not fairly uniform in terms of its cost  selling price relationship and turnover  or applying the retail inventory method to transactions that include different rates of gross profit  such as those relating to seasonal merchandise 
in addition  failure to take timely markdowns can result in an overstatement of inventory under the lower of cost or market principle 
we believe that the retail inventory method we use provides an inventory valuation that approximates cost and results in carrying inventory in the aggregate at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record an adjustment for excess or old inventory based primarily on an estimated forecast of merchandise demand for the selling season 
demand for merchandise can fluctuate greatly 
a significant increase in the demand for merchandise could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future merchandise demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the adjustment required for excess or old inventory 
if our inventory is determined to be overvalued in the future  we would be required to recognize such costs in costs of goods sold and reduce operating income at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is later determined to be undervalued  we may have overstated the costs of goods sold in previous periods and would recognize additional operating income when such inventory is sold 
therefore  although every effort is made to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of merchandise demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or in economic conditions within our markets could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
as of january  and january   approximately of our inventories were valued using a first in  first out cost basis and approximately of our inventories were valued using a last in  first out lifo cost basis 
as is currently the case with many companies in the retail industry  our lifo calculations yielded inventory increases due to deflation reflected in price indices used 
the lifo method values merchandise sold at the cost of more recent inventory purchases which the deflationary indices indicated to be lower  resulting in the general inventory on hand being carried at the older  higher costs 
given these higher values and the promotional retail environment  we have reduced the carrying value of our lifo inventories to an estimated realizable value 
these reductions totaled million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
inherent in the valuation of inventories are significant management judgments and estimates regarding future merchandise selling costs and pricing 
should these estimates prove to be inaccurate  we may have overstated or understated our inventory carrying value 
in such cases  operating results would ultimately be impacted 
vendor allowances as is standard industry practice  allowances from merchandise vendors are received as reimbursement for charges incurred on marked down merchandise 
vendor allowances are generally credited to costs of goods sold  provided the allowance is collectable  for merchandise either permanently marked down or sold  not predicated on a future purchase  not predicated on a future increase in the purchase price from the vendor  and authorized by internal management 
if the aforementioned criteria are not met  the allowances are recorded as an adjustment to the cost of merchandise capitalized in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
additionally  allowances are received from vendors in connection with cooperative advertising programs and for reimbursement of certain payroll expenses 
these allowances are reviewed to ensure reimbursements are for specific  incremental and identifiable advertising or payroll costs incurred to sell the vendor s products 
if a vendor reimbursement exceeds the costs incurred  the excess reimbursement is recorded as a reduction of cost purchases from the vendor and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold 
all other amounts are recognized as a reduction of the related advertising or payroll costs that have been incurred and reflected in sg a expense 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the process involves summarizing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  we are required to assess whether valuation allowances should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period  an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the statement of operations 
we reported net deferred tax liabilities of million at january  and net deferred tax assets of million at january  in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized based upon all available evidence  including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical operating results  projected future operating results  tax carry back availability and limitations pursuant to section of the internal revenue code  among others 
significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result  current or previous losses are given more weight than any projected future taxable income 
in addition  a recent three year historical cumulative loss is considered a significant element of negative evidence that is difficult to overcome 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets each reporting period  including assessment of the company s cumulative income or loss over the prior three year period  to determine if valuation allowances are required 
with respect to our review for the fourth quarter of  a significant element of negative evidence considered was our three year historical cumulative loss as of the fourth quarter of this  combined with uncertain near term economic conditions  impeded our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in establishing the deferred tax assets valuation allowance at january  accordingly  a nearly full valuation allowance was established on our net deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of with respect to our reviews during  our three year historical cumulative loss and the continuation of uncertain near term economic conditions again impeded our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in assessing valuation allowance requirements 
as such  we concluded that it was necessary to maintain a full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax asset valuation allowance totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
if actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
if sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard  the valuation allowance would be reversed accordingly in the period that such a conclusion is reached 
we recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained 
recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized 
changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time  and changes to our assumptions and judgments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
long lived assets property  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in our business model or capital strategy can result in the actual useful lives differing from estimates 
in cases where we determined that the useful life of property  fixtures and equipment should be shortened  we depreciated the net book value in excess of the salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby increasing depreciation expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or leasehold improvements could also result in shortened useful lives 
our net property  fixtures and equipment amounted to million and million at january  and january   respectively 
we are required to test a long lived asset for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance of stores relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends for a sustained period 
if the undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are insufficient to support the recorded asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results  adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
estimates of fair value are calculated based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
should cash flow estimates differ significantly from actual results  an impairment could arise and materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
given the seasonality of operations  impairment is not conclusive  in many cases  until after the holiday period in the fourth quarter is concluded 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type  store location  current marketplace awareness of private label brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results 
if conditions prove to be substantially different from expectations  the carrying value of new stores long lived assets may ultimately become impaired 
we evaluated the recoverability of our long lived assets and  as a result  in we recognized a million asset impairment charge which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store and distribution center properties 
these analyses anticipate continued difficult economic conditions 
should economic conditions be worse than anticipated  additional impairment charges could result 
in and  we recorded asset impairment charges which resulted in a reduction in the carrying amount of certain store properties of million and million  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets net intangible assets totaled million and million at january  and january   respectively 
our intangible assets at january  are principally comprised of million of lease interests that relate to below market rate leases and million associated with trade names  private label brand names and customer lists 
the lease related interests are being amortized using a straight line method 
the customer lists are being amortized using a declining balance method 
at january   lease related interests and customer lists had average remaining lives of thirteen years and nine years  respectively  for amortization purposes 
at january   trade names and private label brand names of million have been deemed as having indefinite lives 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually or when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values 
fair value is determined using quoted market prices and or a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires certain assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors 
our policy is to conduct impairment testing based on our most current business plans  which reflect anticipated changes in the economy and the industry 
we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of based upon our review  the fair value of our single reporting unit  estimated using a combination of our common stock trading value as of the end of the second quarter of  a discounted cash flow analysis and other generally accepted valuation methodologies  was less than the carrying amount 
the charge reduced the balance of goodwill to zero at january  no such charge was recorded in as a result of our review of the carrying amount of intangible assets in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to a reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names 
in  we recognized asset impairment charges of million and million on indefinite lived trade names and private label brand names  respectively 
in  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to the reduction in the value of two indefinite lived private label brand names 
while the carrying value of intangible assets has been substantially reduced  should future results or economic events cause a change in our projected cash flows  future estimates of fair value may not support the carrying amount of these assets 
if actual results prove inconsistent with our assumptions and judgments  we could be exposed to a material impairment charge 
insurance reserve estimates we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks  including workers compensation  general liability and employee related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by our associates 
we determine the estimates for the liabilities associated with these risks by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
a change in claims frequency and severity of claims from historical experience as well as changes in state statutes and the mix of states in which we operate could result in a change to the required reserve levels 
pension and supplementary retirement plans we provide an unfunded supplementary pension plan to certain key executives 
through acquisitions  we acquired a defined benefit pension plan and assumed the liabilities of three supplementary pension plans and a postretirement benefit plan 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the defined benefit plan s assets 
the discount rate assumption is evaluated annually 
we utilize the citibank pension discount curve cpdc to develop the discount rate assumption 
the cpdc is developed from a us treasury par curve that reflects the treasury coupon and strips market 
option adjusted spreads drawn from the double a corporate bond sector are layered in to develop a double a corporate par curve  from which the cpdc spot rates are developed 
the cpdc spot rates are applied to expected benefit payments  from which a single constant discount rate can then be developed based on the expected timing of these benefit payments 
we base our asset return assumption on current and expected allocations of assets  as well as a long term view of expected returns on the plan asset categories 
we assess the appropriateness of the expected rate of return on an annual basis and  when necessary  revise the assumption 
our target pension plan asset allocation of equity securities  fixed income and real estate at january  and january  was  and  respectively 
changes in the assumptions regarding the discount rate and expected return on plan assets may result in materially different expense and liability amounts 
actuarial estimations may differ materially from actual results  reflecting many factors including changing market and economic conditions  changes in investment strategies  higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
in addition  while we are not required to make any mandatory contributions to the defined benefit pension plan in  the funded status of this plan and the related cost reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  particularly in the current economic environment 
under the pension protection act of  losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the defined benefit pension plan in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements 
downward pressure on the asset values of the defined benefit pension plan may require us to fund obligations earlier than we forecasted  which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations 
in the first quarter of  we paid million pursuant to the termination of one of our unfunded supplemental pension plans 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asu  which requires new disclosures regarding recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements 
entities will be required to separately disclose significant transfers into and out of level and level measurements in the fair value hierarchy and the reasons for the transfers and provide information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
in addition  entities must provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities and  for level or level measurements  disclose the valuation technique and inputs used in determining fair value for each class 
the enhanced fair value measurement disclosures required by asu are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not anticipate the adoption of the disclosure requirements of asu will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued asu no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures topic measuring liabilities at fair value asu  which provides amendments to accounting standards codification asc subtopic  fair value measurements and disclosures overall  for the fair value measurement of liabilities 
asu provides clarification on measuring liabilities at fair value when a quoted price in an active market is not available 
the amendments are intended to reduce potential ambiguity in financial reporting when measuring the fair value of liabilities 
the company adopted the provisions of this update  as required  in the adoption of asu did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
asc subtopic  compensation retirement benefits defined benefit plans asc  requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about investment allocation decisions  the major categories of plan assets  the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value of plan assets  the effect of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in plan assets for the period and significant concentrations of risk within plan assets 
the enhanced disclosures required by asc are provided in note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk and financial instruments we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
to provide some protection against potential rate increases associated with our variable rate facilities  we enter into derivative financial transactions in the form of interest rate swaps 
the interest rate swaps are used to reduce or eliminate the variability of interest payments on the underlying variable rate facilities 
the swaps interest rate differential is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the swaps 
at january   we held two variable to fixed rate swaps with a notional amount of million each 
the notional amount does not represent amounts exchanged by the parties  rather  it is used as the basis to calculate amounts due and to be received under the rate swap 
during and  we did not enter into or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the following table provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including debt obligations and the interest rate swaps 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at january  for the interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amount and weighted average pay and receive interest rates by expected maturity date 
for additional discussion of our interest rate swaps  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements

see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the company s quarterly results for and due to the fixed nature of certain costs  sg a expense is typically higher as a percentage of net sales during the first half of each year 
working capital requirements fluctuate during the year as well and generally reach their highest levels during the third and fourth quarters 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for a full year 
in addition  quarterly operating results are impacted by the timing and amount of revenues and costs associated with the opening of new stores and the closing and remodeling of existing stores 
although we cannot determine the precise effects of inflation on our business  we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on operating results during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by material inflationary adjustments in the future
