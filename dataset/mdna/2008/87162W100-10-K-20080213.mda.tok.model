table of contents the it distribution and contract assembly industries in which we operate are characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
as well  the market for it products and services is generally characterized by declining unit prices and short product life cycles 
we set our sales price based on the market supply and demand characteristics for each particular product or bundle of products we distribute and services we provide 
our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for it products and services 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products  overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it industry and increased price based competition 
revenue and cost of revenue we derive our revenue primarily through the distribution of it systems  peripherals  system components  software  networking equipment  assembly services and business process outsourcing services  or bpo 
we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse

from time to time  we also participate in the incentive and rebate programs of our oem suppliers 
these programs are important determinants of the final sales price we charge to our reseller customers 
to mitigate the risk of declining prices and obsolescence of our distribution inventory  our oem suppliers generally offer us limited price protection and return rights for products that are marked down or discontinued by them 
we carefully manage our inventory to maximize the benefit to us of these supplier provided protections 
a significant portion of our cost of revenue is the purchase price we pay our oem suppliers for the products we sell  net of any rebates and purchase discounts received from our oem suppliers 
cost of product distribution revenue also consists of provisions for inventory losses and write downs  and freight expenses associated with the receipt in and shipment out of our inventory 
in addition  cost of revenue includes the cost of materials  labor and overhead for our contract assembly and bpo services 
margins the it product industry in which we operate is characterized by low gross profit as a percentage of revenue  or gross margin  and low income from operations as a percentage of revenue  or operating margin 
our gross margin has fluctuated between and annually over the past three years due to changes in the mix of 
table of contents products and services we offer  customers we sell to  competition  seasonality  replacing less profitable business with investments in higher margin  more profitable lines such as supplies  technology solutions and consumer electronics and the general economic environment 
increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for it products may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margin 
generally  when our revenue becomes more concentrated on limited products or customers  our gross margin tends to decrease due to increased pricing pressure from oem suppliers or reseller customers 
our operating margin has also fluctuated between and annually over the past three years  based primarily on our ability to achieve economies of scale  the management of our operating expenses  changes in the relative mix of our distribution and contract assembly revenue and the timing of our acquisitions and investments

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the net book value of the property was million at november  economic and industry trends our revenue is highly dependent on the end market demand for it products 
this end market demand is influenced by many factors including the introduction of new it products and software by oems  replacement cycles for existing it products and overall economic growth and general business activity 
a difficult and challenging economic environment may also lead to consolidation or decline in the it distribution industry and increased price based competition 
the bpo industry is extremely competitive 
the customers performance measures are based on competitive pricing terms and quality of services 
accordingly  we could be subject to pricing pressure and may experience a decline in our average selling prices for our services 
seasonality our operating results are affected by the seasonality of the it products industry 
we have historically experienced higher sales in our fourth fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting  federal government spending and purchasing cycles of our customers and end users 
these patterns may not be repeated in subsequent periods 
deferred compensation plan we have a deferred compensation plan for a limited number of our directors and employees 
we maintain a liability on our balance sheet for salary and bonus amounts deferred by participants and we accrue interest expense on unpaid amounts 
interest expense on the deferred amounts is classified in interest expense and finance charges  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
the plan allows for the participants to direct investments of deferred amounts in equity securities and other investments 
the equity securities are classified as trading securities

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussions and analyses of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we review and evaluate our estimates and assumptions  including those that relate to accounts receivable  vendor programs  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  share based compensation  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
our estimates are based on our historical experience and a variety of other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making our judgment about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our judgment  estimates and or assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue generally as products are shipped  if a purchase order exists  the sale price is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured  risk of loss and title have transferred and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipping terms are typically fob our warehouse 
provisions for sales returns are estimated based on historical data and are recorded concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
these provisions are reviewed and adjusted periodically by us 
revenue is reduced for early payment discounts and volume incentive rebates offered to customers 
we purchase licensed software products from original oem vendors and distribute them to customers 
revenue is recognized upon shipment of software products when a purchase order exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
subsequent to the sale of software products  we generally have no obligation to provide any modification  customization  upgrades  enhancements  or any other post contract customer support 
our mexico operation entered into a multi year contract to sell equipment to a contractor that provides equipment and services to the mexican government 
under the agreement  the mexican government makes payments into our account 
the payments on this contract by the mexican government are generally due on a monthly basis and are contingent upon the contractor continuing to provide services to the government 
we recognize product revenue and cost of revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
we provide our bpo services to clients under contracts that typically consist of a master services agreement or statement of work  which contains the terms and conditions of each program and service we offer 
revenue is generally recognized over the terms and duration of the contract if the service has already been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide allowances for doubtful accounts on our accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for outstanding balances 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the accounts receivable  credit evaluations of customers financial condition and existence of credit insurance 
we also evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable based on specific customer circumstances  current economic trends  historical experience with collections and value and adequacy of collateral received from customers 
oem supplier programs 
we receive funds from oem suppliers for inventory price protection  product rebates  marketing and infrastructure reimbursement  and promotion programs 
product rebates are recorded as a reduction of cost of revenue 
marketing  infrastructure and promotion programs are recorded  net of direct costs  in selling  general and administrative expense 
any excess funds associated with these programs are recorded in cost of revenue 
we accrue rebates based on the terms of the program and sales of qualifying products 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
amounts received or receivable from oem suppliers that are not yet earned are deferred on our balance sheet 
actual rebates may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued 
in addition  if market conditions were to deteriorate due to an economic downturn  oem suppliers may change the terms of some or all of these programs or cease them altogether 
any such change could lower our gross margins on products we sell or revenue earned 
we also provide reserves for receivables on oem supplier programs for estimated losses resulting from oem suppliers inability to pay  or rejections of such claims by oem suppliers 
inventories 
our inventory levels are based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can cause us to have excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our inventories to their estimated net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
these write downs are reflected in our cost of revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturns  rapid product improvements and technological changes  our ability to return to oem suppliers a certain percentage of our purchases  and protection from loss in value of inventory under our oem supplier agreements 

table of contents goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely 
we also assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets on an annual basis 
if indicators of impairment were present in intangible assets used in operations and future cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
factors we consider important  which may cause an impairment include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses  for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimating foreign tax credits 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the indicated periods  data as percentages of revenue fiscal years ended november  statements of operations data revenue cost of revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from continuing operations before non operating items and income taxes interest expense and finance charges  net other income  net income from operations before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest in a subsidiary income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax net income 
table of contents fiscal years ended november   and revenue 
year ended november  percent change to to in thousands in thousands in thousands revenue the increase in our revenue year over year was primarily attributable to continued growth in our business in the united states and canada  overall increased demand for our products and services  increased selling and marketing efforts and the contribution from our acquisitions made during fiscal years and the fiscal increase in revenue from fiscal is due to our focus on our enterprise solutions and consumer electronics divisions  partially offset by a decline in revenue from our contract assembly services 
these increases were somewhat mitigated by continued significant competition in the it distribution marketplace  vendor direct sales models  and our desire to focus on operating income growth before revenue growth 
gross profit 
year ended november  percent change to to in thousands in thousands in thousands gross profit percentage of revenue our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including competition  the mix and average selling prices of products and services we sell  the mix of customers to whom we sell  our sources of revenue by division  rebate and discount programs from our suppliers  freight costs  reserves for inventory losses  fluctuations in revenue and overhead costs of our contract assembly and bpo services 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue in fiscal over fiscal and  respectively  was mainly due to the continued focus on improving all aspects of gross profit within our business  customer and product mix  gross margin contributions from our acquisitions over the past year  and our increased value added service offerings 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
year ended november  percent change to to in thousands in thousands in thousands selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of revenue our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  bonuses  and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  product marketing  business process services operations and administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include share based compensation expense  deferred compensation expense or income  temporary personnel fees  costs of our facilities  utility expense  professional fees  depreciation expense on our capital equipment  bad debt expense  amortization expense on our intangible assets and marketing expenses  offset by reimbursements from oem suppliers 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal  both on a dollar basis as well as percentage of revenue due to additional expense incurred from our recent acquisitions  the costs to integrate these acquisitions into our business  the duplicative costs of operating multiple overlapping facilities in canada during consolidation of these facilities  restructuring charges of million in connection with the acquisition of rgc and increased share based compensation expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from the prior year both on a dollar basis as well as percentage of revenue  primarily as a result of incremental expenses associated with our increased revenue  an increase in headcount for new and existing business initiatives  share based compensation expense and additional expenses associated with our acquisitions and integration of telpar  azerty and concentrix 
these increases were partially offset by a million restructuring charge that was incurred in fiscal income from continuing operations before non operating items  income taxes and minority interest 
year ended november  percent change to to in thousands in thousands in thousands income from continuing operations before non operating items and income taxes percentage of revenue our income from operations before non operating items  income taxes and minority interest as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal from and in fiscal and  respectively  primarily due to the increase in revenue as well as the increase in gross margin slightly offset by increases in selling  general and administrative expenses 
interest expense and finance charges  net 
year ended november  percent change to to in thousands in thousands in thousands interest expense and finance charges  net amounts recorded in interest expense and finance charges  net  are primarily due to interest expense paid on our lines of credit  other debt  fees associated with third party accounts receivable flooring arrangements and the sale of accounts receivable through our securitization facility  offset by income earned on our excess cash investments and financing income from our mexico operation 
the decrease in interest expense and finance charges  net  in fiscal from fiscal and  was due to long term project business we engaged in with one of our customers in mexico 
the primary return from this business is interest income resulting from long term financing of computer hardware sold to our customer and is reflected in our net financing cost for the year 
this income amount was partially offset by an increase in finance charges and interest expenses due to an overall higher interest rate environment  higher borrowings due to increased business and increased long term debt due to the long term project in mexico 

table of contents other income  net 
year ended november  percent change to to in thousands in thousands in thousands other income  net amounts recorded in other income  net  include foreign currency transaction gains and losses  investment gains and losses  including those in our deferred compensation plan and other non operating gains and losses 
the increase in other income  net in fiscal from fiscal is due to net foreign exchange gains of million in compared to a million loss in the decrease in other income  net  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to a decrease in marketable securities income of million and foreign exchange loss of million 
provision for income taxes 
income taxes consist of our current and deferred tax expense resulting from our income earned in domestic and foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared with an effective tax rate of in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was slightly higher than in fiscal  primarily due to usage of all net operating loss carry forwards at our mexico operation and profit mix from various geographies offset by a million one time tax credit resulting from conclusion of a canadian tax audit 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared with effective tax rate of in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than fiscal  primarily due to higher profit in lower tax jurisdictions and the utilization of previously unrecognized net operating loss carry forwards at our mexico operation due to its profitability in fiscal minority interest 
on april   we acquired a controlling interest in china civilink cayman  which operates in china as hichina web solutions 
minority interest is the portion of earnings from operations from hichina web solutions  attributable to others 
minority interest in fiscal and  respectively  was the portion of earnings from operations from our subsidiary in mexico attributable to others 
in november  we purchased the remaining interest in our mexico operation from our minority shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our business is working capital intensive 
our working capital needs are primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we rely heavily on debt  accounts receivable flooring programs and the sale of our accounts receivable under our securitization programs for our working capital needs 
we have financed our growth and cash needs to date primarily through working capital financing facilities  bank credit lines and cash generated from operations 
the primary uses of cash have been to fund increases in inventory and accounts receivable resulting from increased sales  and for acquisitions 

table of contents to increase our market share and better serve our customers  we may further expand our operations through investments or acquisitions 
we expect that such expansion would require an initial investment in personnel  facilities and operations  which may be more costly than similar investments in current operations 
as a result of these investments  we may experience an increase in cost of sales and operating expenses that is disproportionate to revenue from those operations 
these investments or acquisitions would likely be funded primarily by incurring additional debt or issuing common stock 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in deferred liabilities of million and an decrease in payable to affiliates of million offset by an increase in accounts payables of million  a decrease in other assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and net income of million 
the increase in accounts receivable of million is primarily due to a change in terms in our us securitization arrangement during the first quarter of fiscal which resulted in accounts receivable transacted in our us securitization arrangement being classified as on balance sheet transactions versus the prior quarter when they were classified as off balance sheet 
net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal cash used in operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to the net increase in other assets of million  increase in inventories of million offset by increase in deferred liabilities of million  net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  share based compensation of million and excess tax benefits from stock options of million 
the increase in deferred liabilities and assets was a result of our multi year contract from our mexico contract from our mexico operation 
prior to adopting sfas no 
r  we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r  requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  million and million of excess of tax benefits for the years ended november  and  respectively  have been reported as a cash inflow from financing activities
