item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document 
general overview and trends we are a genetics focused personalized health company that develops preventive consumer products and genetic tests for sale to the emerging personalized health market 
our vision is to build a leading personalized health and wellness company using the science of applied genetics to empower consumers to personalize their health 
we currently have two primary business segments that include personalized health segment phs this segment researches and develops genetic tests that leverage and target the role that genetically determined variations in the inflammatory response have on health and disease consumer products segment cps comprising the alan james group ajg business  which we purchased on august   this segment is focused on developing  selling and marketing nutritional supplements and products into retail consumer channels 
these two segments contribute toward our overall mission of developing tests and products that can help individuals improve and maintain their health through preventive measures 
we plan to pursue this by developing genetic risk assessment tests for use in multiple indications  countries and various demographics in our phs  processing genetic risk assessment tests in our clinical laboratory improvement act of clia certified lab or in those of sublicensees in our phs  developing and acquiring nutritional products to be distributed in multiple consumer channels in our cps  and conducting research and development of personalized preventive and therapeutic botanicals based on individuals genetic information in our cps 
the consumer products segment sells branded nutritional products  including ginsana  ginkoba  and venastat through the nation s largest food  drug and mass retailers 
the addition of ajg added substantial revenues to our business and in the year ended december   ajg represented over of our consolidated revenues 
customer concentration in our cps segment is high and our largest customer accounted for approximately of revenues in that segment 
also in  sales of our personalized health products phs began under marketing and other business arrangements with alticor 
for  alticor represents a significant customer representing virtually all of our phs revenues and over of consolidated revenues 
in  the addition of ajg also added to the selling general and administrative costs necessary to run a consumer products business and it added substantial amortization of intangible assets acquired in the purchase 
in the year ended december   amortization of intangible assets was approximately million compared to less than thousand in the year prior to the acquisition 
such amortization expense will continue in and beyond as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have traditionally spent approximately to million annually on research and development 
we currently anticipate that range of spending to continue into our current development programs focus on heart disease  osteoporosis  osteoarthritis  gastric cancer  skin appearance  sports nutrition and weight management genetic risk assessment tests as well as new proprietary supplements for distribution through the cps 
we expect that these programs will also lead to the personalized selection of nutritional and therapeutic products  and provide consumers and healthcare professionals with better preventive product alternatives 
in march  we entered into a research agreement with alticor to develop genetic tests and software to assess personalized risk and develop and use screening technologies to validate the effectiveness of the nutrigenomic consumables alticor is developing 
in march and in march  we entered into new agreements with alticor to continue the research being performed 
in june  we entered into another research agreement with alticor to conduct research into the development of a test to identify individuals with specific genetic variations that affect how people gain and maintain weight 
this project was completed during in june  we entered into another research agreement with alticor to perform association studies on composite genotypes to skin inflammatory response 
as of december   the research agreements described above have been completed 
see financial statement footnote for a discussion of our strategic alliance with alticor 
on february   we entered into a new research agreement with access business group international llc abg  a subsidiary of alticor inc the research agreement encompasses four primary areas osteoporosis  cardiovascular disease  nutrigenomics  and dermagenomics 
we will be conducting various clinical studies  which shall be fully funded by alticor 
some of these studies aim to correlate snp gene variations to the risk of osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease in asian populations 
other studies conducted in north american populations will seek to identify genetic factors that influence athletic performance nutrigenomics and skin health  such as wrinkles  elasticity  aging dermagenomics  for the purpose of developing products to enhance healthy aging 
under the terms of the agreement  abg will pay us million during for the research 
in addition  we will recognize approximately thousand of deferred receipts which were unused from prior research agreements with alticor 
in the cps segment  the nutritional products and supplement industry is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in demand for products and new product introductions 
the success of new product offerings depends upon a number of factors  including accurately anticipating customer needs  innovating and developing new products  successfully commercializing new products in a timely manner  pricing our products competitively  manufacturing and delivering our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner  and differentiating our product offerings from those of our competitors 
in  the aggregate sales of our brand name nutritional products  including ginkoba  ginsana  and venastat demonstrated a slight decline from the prior year which we believe is consistent with a general decline in this segment of the industry year over year 
we face competition with private label offerings as well as other branded product introductions 
further  our opportunities for new distribution on the existing product lines are limited 
as a result  we do not expect sales growth of our existing nutritional products and may even experience declines in the future 
we believe that  our growth will be more dependent on our ability to adapt to changing consumer trends with the introduction of new products or improvements to existing products 
in our phs  the competition is defined  but the markets and customer base are not well established 
adoption of such technologies by consumers requires substantial market development 
we have placed a significant focus of this effort in our relationship with our primary customer  alticor  a significant direct marketing company 
alticor has begun to develop the direct to consumer market  however  the overall market is unproven and our challenge in and beyond will be to work to develop this market 
since alticor has not previously sold a product similar to the genetic risk assessment tests  we cannot predict any fluctuations we may experience in our test revenues or whether revenues derived from alticor related to the heart health and general nutrition genetic tests will be sustained in future periods 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and borrowings available under our credit facilities of million  expiring on august  net cash used in operating activities was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was thousand and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in august  we acquired the assets and business of the alan james group as described above 
we paid initial consideration at the closing consisting of approximately million in cash and the obligation to place in escrow thousand and  shares of common stock 
capital additions and increases in other assets were thousand and thousand for the year ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was thousand for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  during  we received thousand from the exercise of stock options  stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan and from our rights offering completed in january in august  we issued and sold to alticor  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  or per share 
in addition  during  we received million of research funding from our strategic alliance with alticor  million from the exercise of stock options and warrants and thousand from stock purchases through the employee stock purchase plan 
these amounts were offset by thousand of payments of our capital lease obligations 
we currently do not have any commitments for any material capital expenditures 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is included in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations   operating lease obligations    total    based on our current operating and capital expenditure forecasts  we believe that the combination of funds currently available and our available lines of credit will be adequate to finance our ongoing operations for at least the next twelve months 
there is adequate capital to meet our current needs per our overall strategic plan 
going forward there will be investment in new product development for genetic testing and ajg products  improving our distribution channels  strategic marketing of tests  which may require raising additional capital 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase of million was due largely to inclusion of the consumer products segment for the full year whereas in that segment was only included since its acquisition on august  the phs resulted in an increase of thousand in over revenue from our segments consisted of the following year ended december  change change personalized health genetic testing    contract research and development   other   segment total    consumer products    total    we have two significant customers 
in our phs  our significant customer  alticor  which is the company s majority shareholder  represented approximately of the revenues of that segment and in our cps segment  our significant customer represented approximately of the revenues of that segment 
together  these two customers account for approximately of revenues 
gross profit was approximately million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  gross profit from the phs was approximately million  or of its revenue compared to approximately million and in the year ended december  gross profit from the cps was approximately million  or of its revenue compared to approximately  and in the period from acquisition through december  research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of thousand or 
funded research and development expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately thousand or 
between march and march  we entered into various research agreements with alticor as described above in general overview and trends 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
approximately million of this increase results from the inclusion of our cps for the full year and only since its acquisition in august in the prior year 
amortization of intangible assets was approximately million for year ended december  compared to approximately thousand during the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to amortization expense associated with acquisition related intangible assets for the full year in and only since acquisition in august  in the year ended december  other expense  net  decreased by approximately thousand to approximately thousand principally as a result of increased interest income 
revenue  gross profit  operating and other expenses contributed to a net loss of approximately million  or per share  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of approximately million  or per share for comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  revenue for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to approximately thousand for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million 
the largest increase was due to revenues of approximately million from our phs  including approximately million from alticor for the heart health genetic test and the general nutrition genetic test  both of which were launched by alticor during the first quarter of additionally  approximately million was generated from our cps since its acquisition on august  gross profit was approximately million  or of revenue  for the year ended december  gross profit from personalized health testing  including fixed overhead costs associated with laboratory operations  was approximately million  or of revenue 
gross profit from consumer products revenue was approximately thousand for the period from august  the date of our acquisition of that business to december   or approximately of revenue 
this lower than normal gross profit was primarily due to the sale of inventory revalued at the date of acquisition and sold through to customers during the period 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million for year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or 
this increase was largely attributable to costs of approximately thousand incurred by the consumer products group since its acquisition august  and the recording of approximately thousand of stock based compensation expense for year ended december  as a result of adopting sfas no 
r 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  includes approximately thousand of costs associated with the termination of employees as a result of cost cutting efforts 
this increase in costs in was partially offset by non recurring professional fees incurred in associated with the implementation of sarbanes oxley section amortization of intangible assets was approximately thousand for year ended december  compared to approximately thousand during the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to amortization expense associated with the august acquisition of the consumer products segment and their related intangible assets 
other expense  net  decreased by approximately thousand primarily as a result of an increase in net interest income net of interest expense of approximately that amount 
revenue  gross profit  operating and other expenses for the year ended december  contributed to a net loss of million  or per share  compared to a loss of million  or per share for critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are the following strategic alliance with alticor we account for our strategic alliance with alticor in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for convertible instruments granted or issued to a nonemployee for goods or services or a combination of goods or services and cash eitf no 

under eitf no 
 the proceeds received from alticor in connection with the march  transaction must first be allocated to the fair value of the convertible instruments issued 
as of march   the fair value of the convertible instruments issued was million  therefore proceeds received from alticor in connection with the march  transaction  up to million  have been recorded as equity 
revenue recognition revenue from genetic testing services is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  service has been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service is deemed to be rendered when the results have been reported to the individual who ordered the test 
revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred and title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have no consignment sales 
product revenue is reduced for allowances and adjustments  including returns  discontinued items  discounts  trade promotions and slotting fees 
revenue from contract research and development is recognized over the term of the contract as we perform our obligations under the contract 
allowance for sales returns our recognition of revenue from sales to retailers is impacted by giving them rights to return damaged and outdated products as well as the fact that as a practical business matter  our sales force  along with our customers  is constantly working to ensure profitability of our products within retailers by rotating slow moving items out of stores and replacing those products with what we and the retailer expect will be more profitable  faster selling items 
for product sales  we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate future returns  we recognize revenue at the time of sale 
for product sales which we cannot estimate future returns  particularly new products  we defer revenue recognition until the return privilege has substantially expired or the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated 
an adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional sales returns 
we analyze sales returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
we are able to make reasonable and reliable estimates based on history 
we also monitor the buying patterns of the end users of our products based on sales data received 
we review our estimated product returns based on expected data communicated by our customers 
we also monitor the levels of inventory at our largest customers to avoid excessive customer stocking of merchandise 
we believe we have sufficient interaction and knowledge of our customers and of the industry trends and conditions to adjust the accrual for returns when necessary 
we believe that this analysis creates appropriate estimates of expected future returns 
there is no guarantee that future returns will not increase to  or exceed  the levels experienced in the past 
furthermore  the possibility exists that should we lose a major account  we may agree to accept a substantial amount of returns 
trade promotions we use objective procedures for estimating our allowance for trade promotions 
the allowance for trade promotions offered to customers is based on contracted terms or other arrangements agreed in advance 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we monitor our inventory and analyze it on a regular basis 
cycle counts are taken periodically to verify inventory levels 
in addition  we analyze the movement of items within our inventory in an effort to determine the likelihood that inventory will be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
we provide an allowance against that portion of inventory that we believe is unlikely to be sold or used before expiration dates are reached 
an adverse change in any of these factors may result in the need for additional inventory allowance 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective basis 
sfas no 
r addresses all forms of share based payment sbp awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense sbp awards with compensation cost for sbp transactions measured at fair value 
sfas no 
r applies to new equity awards and to equity awards modified  repurchased or canceled after the effective date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the effective date shall be recognized as the requisite service is rendered on or after the effective date 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards shall be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated from the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
additionally  common stock purchased pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan will be expensed based upon the fair market value in excess of purchase price 
intangible assets purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed 
we have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
values were assigned to intangible assets based on third party independent valuations  as well as management s forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenue and cash flows generated from the acquired assets 
income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states  which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in january  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes how a company should recognize  measure  present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that a company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
at december   we reviewed all material tax positions for all years open to statute and for all tax jurisdictions open to statute to determine whether it was more likely than not that the positions taken would be sustained based upon the technical merits of those positions 
based on our analysis  we concluded that a tax reserve for uncertain tax positions does not need to be established as a result of our adoption of fin contingencies estimated losses from contingencies are accrued by management based upon the likelihood of a loss and the ability to reasonably estimate the amount of the loss 
estimating potential losses  or even a range of losses  is difficult and involves a great deal of judgment 
management relies primarily on assessments made by its external legal counsel to make our determination as to whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be recorded or disclosed 
should the resolution of a contingency result in a loss that we did not accrue because management did not believe a loss was probable or capable of being reasonably estimated  then this loss would result in a charge to income in the period the contingency was resolved 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
was issued to provide consistency and comparability in determining fair value measurements and to provide for expanded disclosures about fair measurements 
the definition about of fair value maintains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value but focuses on the exit price of the asset or liability 
the exit price is the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability adjusted for certain inherent risks and restrictions 
expanded disclosures are also required about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the effective date is for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this statement on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we have not yet determined the impact  if any  of adopting this statement on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf clarifies the accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research and development activities 
eitf states that such payments should be capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or the services rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect of eitf on our financial statements but do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on our financial position or the results of our operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations  which establishes principles for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in a business combination  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of a business combination 
we are required to apply this statement prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  earlier application is not permitted 
in december  the fasb ratified a consensus opinion reached by the eitf on eitf issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf 
the guidance in eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes presentation and disclosure requirements for transactions within a collaborative arrangement both with third parties and between participants in the arrangement 
the consensus in eitf is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  the consensus requires retrospective application to all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date  unless retrospective application is impracticable 
the impracticability evaluation and exception should be performed on an arrangement by arrangement basis 
we are evaluating the impact of eitf will have on its financial statements 
we currently do not believe that the adoption of eitf will have a significant effect on the financial statements 
in december  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab  share based payment sab which amends sab  share based payment  to permit public companies  under certain circumstances  to use the simplified method in sab for employee option grants after december  use of the simplified method after december is permitted only for companies whose historical data about their employees exercise behavior does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating the expected term of the options 
we currently use the simplified method to estimate the expected term for employee option grants  as adequate historical experience is not available to provide a reasonable estimate 
sab is effective for employee options granted after december  we intend to adopt sab effective january  and continue applying the simplified method until enough historical experience is readily available to provide a reasonable estimate of the expected term for employee option grants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of december   the only financial instruments we carried were cash and cash equivalents 
we believe the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is immaterial 
some of our sales and some of our costs occur outside the united states and are transacted in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
at this time we do not believe this risk is material and we do not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency fluctuation risk 
however  if foreign sales increase and the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation increases  we may in the future consider utilizing derivative instruments to mitigate these risks
