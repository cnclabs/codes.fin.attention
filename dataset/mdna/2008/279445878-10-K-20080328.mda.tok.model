item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations revenues for our gross product sales by geographical regions for the years ended december   and  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
product safety independent toxicology studies  in house laboratory tests and prior field testing demonstrate that our home and garden products are nontoxic to humans and the environment 
the following is a summary of the human health and environmental safety attributes of our products negligible human dietary and environmental exposure 
there is no human dietary or environmental exposure to messenger products resulting from application of the products 
product residues on treated plants are rapidly degraded by sunlight  rain and microorganisms and are undetectable within three to ten days following application  even when applied at rates far above our recommended application rates 
safe for animals 
the us environmental protection agency epa requires that toxicology studies be conducted to evaluate the impact of products on selected animals 
the epa required mammalian toxicology testing placed messenger products in the epa s toxicity category iii or iv  designations reserved for materials with lower hazard potential 
unlike many plant protection and yield enhancement products  messenger products require no label warnings or special use restrictions to protect animals 
nontoxic to plants 
messenger products have not been observed to cause phytotoxicity or any other adverse effects in plants during the course of thousands of field trials conducted on a variety of plants under a wide range of environmental conditions 
also  we have not observed any adverse effects attributable to messenger products in numerous controlled laboratory studies to evaluate their effects on seedling germination and emergence 
sales  marketing and distribution we began a limited marketing of messenger to the home and garden market in march  with the introduction of messenger  primarily for use on roses 
at that time  our home and garden business was an insignificant portion of our overall operations 
in  we created an expanded marketing plan concentrating our home and garden efforts in the pacific northwest and the northeastern regions of the united states  and introduced our mightyplant product in a test market 
at that time  we also began concentrating on acquiring endorsements of our home and garden products from leading authorities that test and advise gardeners regarding the use and expected results from new product introductions 
in  we significantly increased resources allocated to the home and garden market and expanded our efforts to include the southeastern us in our target areas 
this increase in advertising and marketing did result in additional home and garden product revenues  however  such revenues were significantly below our expectations 
in  we reduced resources allocated to the home and garden business and concentrated our efforts on radio advertising  society endorsements and the introduction of messenger seed treatment in the home and garden market 
during  we implemented a limited radio and print advertising and public relations program 
our radio campaign targeted well recognized gardening programs broadcasting in larger markets  such as ralph snodsmith s garden program in new york  which is nationally syndicated  paul parent s garden program in new england  and mallory gwynn s garden program the pacific northwest 
our print advertising program targeted specialty growers affiliated with organizations such as the american rose society  the american dahlia society  the american hemerocallis society and the national garden club 
we also initiated advertising and public relations programs in three new markets texas  florida and wisconsin to build on existing positive word of mouth momentum 
in  we plan to continue these limited radio and print advertising and public relations programs 
we currently have one part time employee fully focused  and one full time employee partially focused  on sales and marketing our home and garden products 
sales of our products in the home and garden market to date have been primarily generated through distributors  retailers and our website based on positive word of mouth from current users 
we do not intend to significantly increase our investment toward the development of our home and garden business and expect that a significant portion of our sales in the home and garden market will continue to be from distributors  retailers and our website and generated through word of mouth 
we work with several independent distributors and retailers for the distribution and sale of our home and garden products and are continuing to develop our distribution network 
we currently have approximately ten key distributors of our home and garden products 
two of these ten distributors each accounted for more than of our net revenues during  and one of the two accounted for more than of our net revenues during phc  who accounted for more than of our net revenues during and  will no longer be one of our distributors due to its acquisition of the harpin protein technology in february we extend credit to certain of the distributors and retailers of our home and garden products 
the failure of any of these distributors and retailers  or any other distributor or retailer to which we extend a significant amount of credit in the future  to pay its account now or in the future may harm our operating results 
seasonality sales of home and garden products depend on planting and growing seasons  climatic conditions and economic and other variables  which we expect to result in substantial fluctuations in our quarterly sales and earnings 
based on the recommended application timing  we expect the second quarter to be the most significant period of use 
our home and garden product sales to distributors are also expected to be seasonal 
however  actual timing of orders received from distributors will depend on many factors  including the amounts of our products in distributors inventories 
product supply  license and supply agreement with phc as of february  and in connection with the sale of our harpin protein technology  we ceased all product development and manufacturing activities 
we believe that our current inventories of messenger  messenger seed treatment and mightyplant with messenger gold are sufficient to support our anticipated sales of those products through thereafter  we expect to acquire all harpin proteins and harpin protein based products for our home and garden business from phc pursuant to our exclusive license and supply agreement with phc 
under this agreement  phc granted us an exclusive worldwide right and license to sell harpin protein based products in the home and garden market  as well as a royalty free  exclusive non transferable worldwide license to use the messenger  mightyplant and harp n tek trademarks in connection with our advertising  promotion  distribution and sale of such products 
the agreement provides that phc will supply us with harpin proteins and harpin protein based products in quantities requested by us through purchase orders submitted pursuant to the license and supply agreement  at a price equal to of phc s actual us agricultural distributor price 
we did not purchase any materials from phc in  and we do not expect to purchase any material from phc in phc warrants that the products supplied under the license and supply agreement will comply with our specifications and applicable laws and regulations and are free of defects in workmanship and materials 
subject to certain conditions  phc must replace or credit us for any products that do not comply with the warranty  which is our sole remedy for any such breach of warranty 
in the event that phc is unable or unwilling to provide us with requested products  we may declare a failure of supply as defined in the license and supply agreement and select and qualify a second source to provide us harpin proteins and harpin protein based products 
phc has granted us a license in the license and supply agreement to use its intellectual property and regulatory approvals solely to make or have made by a second source for us  and to use  distribute  sell or otherwise commercialize  harpin proteins and protein based products for our home and garden business after the occurrence of a failure of supply 
both parties agree to take commercially reasonable efforts to prevent disclosure of confidential information exchanged pursuant to the license and supply agreement 
both parties agree to indemnify and hold harmless the other party for any claims arising from its own actions or omissions  excluding payment of consequential or punitive damages 
subject to certain exceptions  the parties liability to each other will not exceed the aggregate fees paid by us to phc in the six months preceding the event giving rise to the liability 
the license and supply agreement continues until expiration of the last us or foreign patent relating to the products held or acquired by phc in connection with the sale 
the exact date of expiration of these patents and any patents that issue on patent applications will vary depending on when such patents issue and other factors  but is currently projected to occur in or about thereafter  the license and supply agreement will automatically extend for consecutive additional five year periods  unless we elect to terminate the license and supply agreement at our sole option 
we may assign the license and supply agreement to any party that acquires the home and garden business if such party agrees to assume our obligations under the license and supply agreement 
phc may also assign its obligations under the license and supply agreement  however  if phc assigns any part of its business or obligations under the agreement in a manner that prevents us from having an adequate supply of harpin proteins or harpin protein based products  such event will be deemed a failure of supply under the license and supply agreement 
as we no longer develop or manufacture our home and garden products  we rely entirely on phc to manufacture and provide sufficient quantities and quality of our harpin proteins and harpin protein based products on a timely basis for sale in the home and garden market 
for discussion of the risks relating to the license and supply agreement  our sole source of supply and our home and garden business generally  see item a of this annual report entitled risk factors 
patents and proprietary rights as part of the sale of our assets  we transferred to phc all of our patents  patent applications  trademarks  license agreements and other intellectual property relating to the harpin protein technology 
we also transferred to phc all of our rights under our license agreement with the cornell research foundation  pursuant to which we had been granted worldwide exclusive rights to cornell university s technology relating to harpin proteins and related genes 
our home and garden products are now covered by us and foreign patents and patent applications owned by phc or cornell university 
these patents include claims for the harpin family of proteins generally  for various specific harpins  and for the use of harpin proteins to impart disease or insect resistance or to enhance plant growth or improve yields 
patent applications of phc and cornell university include claims to several specific harpin proteins  methods to apply harpin proteins to seeds and the use of harpin proteins to prevent post harvest disease in fruits and vegetables and desiccation in ornamental cuttings 
as described above  phc has granted us an exclusive worldwide right and license to sell harpin protein based products for the protection of plants and seeds and the promotion of overall plant health in the home and garden market 
we believe these rights and licenses preclude our competitors and other entities  including phc  from using or selling harpin protein based products covered under the patents  as they are now issued or may issue in the future  in the home and garden market to impart disease or insect resistance or enhance plant growth 
see product supply  license and supply agreement with phc above for more information on the license  including its duration 
patent law is still evolving relative to the scope and enforceability of claims in the field in which we operate 
the protection of our license or the underlying patents and patent applications that have been licensed to us is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which legal principles are not firmly established 
our license and supply agreement and the patents and patent applications belonging to phc and cornell university may be insufficient to protect the technology underlying our products in the home and garden market 
messenger  mightyplant and harp n tek are registered trademarks of phc in the united states and other foreign countries 
we have been granted  pursuant to the license and supply agreement described above  a royalty free  exclusive non transferable license to use the messenger  mightyplant and harp n tek trademarks in connection with our advertising  promotion  distribution and sale of such products in the home and garden market 
government regulation and registration messenger products that are labeled for use as pesticides are regulated by the epa under the federal insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act fifra and under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca 
the epa has determined that these products are biochemical pesticides  a subset of biopesticides 
compared to traditional chemical pesticides  biopesticides are generally subjected to significantly fewer data requirements to support registration under fifra 
epa granted registration for the full commercial use of several harpin protein based products  including messenger  messenger seed treatment  mighty plant with messenger gold  and other alternate brand name products and formulations 
now that these products are registered by the epa  the food and drug administration is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the exemption from tolerance 
we are required to obtain regulatory approval from certain state and foreign regulatory authorities before we market our home and garden products in those jurisdictions 
prior to our sale of the harpin protein technology  we obtained authorization to manufacture and sell messenger for home and garden use in all states 
in california  we obtained authorization to manufacture and sell messenger for the home and garden market for use on strawberries  grapes and fruiting vegetables for disease management 
all epa federal registrations were transferred to phc in connection with the sale of our harpin protein technology  while state registrations and permits are not transferable 
we currently sell our home and garden products under an month grace period during which we may continue to sell our home and garden products in those jurisdictions for which we previously had obtained authorization 
we obtained our own regulatory approvals under the epa s me too registration process and intend to subsequently register our home and garden products in the states and other jurisdictions  as necessary 
our home and garden products are not registered for sales in any foreign jurisdictions 
our home and garden products are subject to continuing review by the epa  state and or foreign jurisdictions and extensive regulatory requirements 
the epa or the applicable regulatory body in any of these jurisdictions could at any time revoke these registrations  fail to grant us additional registrations  or impose limitations on the use of harpin protein based products upon receipt of newly discovered information  including a failure or inability to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with the product 
pursuant to the license and supply agreement  phc has agreed to maintain in certain jurisdictions  as specified within the license and supply agreement  all regulatory approvals with the epa relating to our home and garden products 
failure of phc to secure and maintain applicable epa approvals or otherwise comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect or interrupt our sole source of supply of home and garden products 
for further discussion of risks associated with our license and supply agreement and our home and garden business generally  see item a of this annual report entitled risk factors 
competition the market for home and garden plant protection and plant health products is intensely competitive  rapidly changing and undergoing consolidation 
the plant health industry is dominated by multinational chemical and pharmaceutical companies  including the scotts miracle grow company  syngenta ag  basf ag and bayer ag 
all of these companies have substantially greater financial  technical  distribution and marketing resources than we do 
competition is based primarily on price and efficacy 
in addition  attracting and retaining qualified personnel  developing production and marketing expertise  developing proprietary products or processes and obtaining regulatory approvals on a timely basis are essential to establishing a competitive market position 
many of the large chemical pesticide companies are also developing products that they believe are less environmentally harmful than traditional chemical pesticides and that may directly compete with our current or any future home and garden products 
syngenta ag  a large multinational company  manufactures a product that is designed to induce disease resistant systems in plants 
other small companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery  research  development and marketing of products similar to ours 
we expect competition within the plant protection and plant health industry to intensify as regulatory pressures on traditional chemical solutions increase 
we believe this will occur as advances in plant protection and disease resistance technologies become more widely known 
many of our current and prospective future competitors have significantly more capital  research and development  regulatory  manufacturing  distribution  sales  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products  receive greater resources and support from independent distributors  initiate or withstand substantial price competition or take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily 
furthermore  large chemical and pharmaceutical companies have a more diversified product offering than we do  which may give them an advantage in meeting customer needs by enabling them to offer integrated solutions to plant protection and plant health in the home and garden market

item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the risk factors described below  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional considerations not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially and adversely affected  the value of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our home and garden business our business is dependent on the success of our home and garden business  which has a limited operating history  has generated only limited revenue to date and in which we do not currently expect to substantially increase our investment 
on february   we completed the sale of all of our harpin protein technology to phc 
following the sale  we retained only our cash  accounts receivable  tax attributes and assets related to our home and garden business  primarily our inventory of harpin protein based products designated for the home and garden market 
in connection with the sale  phc granted us the exclusive license and right to sell harpin protein based products in the home and garden market 
in selling our harpin protein technology  we sold all of our technology and our most significant source of revenue 
the harpin protein technology represented approximately of our total net revenue in each of the years ended december  and our future operations are dependent upon the success of our home and garden business 
our home and garden business has a limited operating history and has had only limited revenues to date 
we generated revenue from our home and garden business of  in   in and  in due to our limited experience operating our home and garden business  we have limited ability to forecast future demand for home and garden products and limited financial data upon which you may evaluate our home and garden business and its prospects 
the gross margins in our home and garden business may be reduced  as compared to margins prior to the sale  due to the cost of purchasing harpin protein based products from phc under the terms of the license and supply agreement described above 
we do not currently intend to significantly increase our investment toward the development of our home and garden business  and we cannot provide any assurance that our home and garden products will achieve greater market acceptance 
moreover  although we may invest in other businesses or technologies in the future  we have no current specific plans to do so at this time 
if we are not successful in operating our home and garden business  our results of operations and financial condition  as well as our ability to explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards  will be adversely affected and ultimately may be unsuccessful 
we may not be able to become profitable unless we identify and acquire other businesses on favorable terms 
we believe that our ability to achieve profitability may depend in substantial part on our ability to identify and acquire suitable acquisitions on favorable terms  so that we can increase our revenues and generate new income 
if we are unable to complete acquisitions on favorable terms  our business will be very limited and may not generate sufficient revenue to cover our expenses 
there is no assurance that we will be able to complete any future acquisitions or that such transactions  if completed  will contribute positively to our operations and financial results and condition 
if we issue stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for stock in connection with any acquisition  our shareholders may experience substantial dilution and new shareholders could have rights superior to current shareholders 
in addition  as further noted below  the provisions of the internal revenue code the code and certain applicable internal revenue service irs regulations will limit the number of shares of stock we can sell from time to time without causing a limitation on our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards 
management could spend or invest the net proceeds from the sale of our harpin protein technology in ways with which our shareholders may not agree 
we received cash proceeds from the sale of our harpin protein technology in the amount of  we have been and plan to continue to use these proceeds to fund the working capital requirements of our home and garden business while we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
however  management will have ultimate discretion as to the specific uses of the proceeds and could spend or invest the proceeds from the sale in ways with which our shareholders may not agree 
the investment of these proceeds may not yield a favorable return 
furthermore  because our home and garden business is evolving  in the future  we may discover new opportunities that are more attractive 
our overall business objective is to become profitable and realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
strategies for attaining this objective may include pursuing acquisitions intended to increase revenues and generate net income 
although we do not currently have specific plans to do so  we may in the future commit resources to such acquisitions or other alternative opportunities 
if we change our business focus  we may face risks that are different from the risks currently associated with our home and garden business 
we will continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flow  and we may never be profitable 
we were required to spend significant funds to complete the transaction with phc  and will be required to spend funds to continue the operations of our home and garden business and to explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses and negative cash flow and have never achieved profitability 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to continue to experience operating losses in our home and garden business for the foreseeable future 
to achieve operating profitability in our home and garden business  we will need to substantially grow the customer base for our home and garden business  however  as noted above  we do not currently intend to significantly increase our investment toward the development of our home and garden business 
we may not be able to increase our revenue in this manner 
the future prospects of our home and garden business must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development 
some of these risks relate to our potential inability to obtain timely access to adequate and cost effective supply of harpin proteins and harpin protein based products  attract and retain customers  particularly in light of uncertain economic conditions and the seasonality of our product use  establish awareness of our home and garden business and home and garden products  expand current and develop new distribution channels to sell products in the home and garden market  obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals  develop additional strategic partnerships to facilitate our marketing and sales efforts  and respond to the rapidly changing market for plant protection and yield enhancement products 
we may not successfully address some or all of these risks 
if we do not successfully address these risks  we may not realize sufficient revenue or net income to reach or sustain profitability or continue operations 
if we are unable to achieve and sustain profitability  we will eventually not have the resources to explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
even if we were to achieve profitability  there are significant material uncertainties about our ability to effectively utilize or otherwise realize potential value from our tax loss carryforwards 
some of these risks and uncertainties are described below under the heading risks related to our business plan to utilize tax loss carryforwards 
as a result of the sale of our harpin protein technology  we are dependent on phc for the manufacture and supply of harpin proteins and harpin protein based products for our home and garden business  and any failure of phc to provide timely delivery of high quality products could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
upon depletion or expiration of our existing home and garden inventory  we expect to acquire all harpin proteins and harpin protein based products for our home and garden business from phc pursuant to a license and supply agreement with phc 
under this agreement  phc has granted us an exclusive worldwide right and license to sell harpin protein based products in the home and garden market  as well as a royalty free  worldwide exclusive non transferable license to use the messenger  mightyplant and harp n tek trademarks in connection with our advertising  promotion  distribution and sale of such products 
the agreement provides that phc will supply us with harpin proteins and harpin protein based products in quantities requested by us through purchase orders submitted pursuant to the supply and license agreement  at a price equal to of phc s actual us agricultural distributor price 
in the event that phc is unable or unwilling to provide us with requested products  we may declare a failure of supply as defined in the license and supply agreement and select and qualify a second source to provide us harpin proteins and harpin protein based products  which may not be available 
the license and supply agreement will continue until expiration of the last us or foreign patent relating to the products held or acquired by phc in connection with the sale 
thereafter  the license and supply agreement will automatically extend for consecutive five year periods  unless we elect to terminate the license and supply agreement at our sole option 
we have no assurance that phc will be able to manufacture and provide sufficient quantities or quality of harpin proteins and harpin protein based products on a timely basis  or at all  or otherwise perform its obligations under the license and supply agreement 
if phc is unwilling or unable to perform such obligations  our home and garden business and results of operations could be materially adversely impaired 
among other things  we may suffer delays in  or be prevented from  fulfilling customer orders and may incur substantial legal and other expenses in enforcing our rights under the license and supply agreement  including identifying and qualifying a second source of supply  if one is even available 
in addition  phc has agreed to maintain in certain jurisdictions  as specified within the license and supply agreement  all regulatory approvals with the epa relating to our home and garden products 
failure of phc to secure and maintain applicable epa approvals or otherwise comply with applicable regulations could adversely affect or interrupt our sole source of supply of home and garden products 
if our sole source of supply is interrupted  our home and garden business and results of operations could be materially adversely impaired 
our home and garden business is relatively new and has limited market awareness  and we may not be successful in building greater market awareness and increasing sales 
our home and garden products are not well known in the market 
our sales of home and garden products to date have come primarily through independent distributors  retailers and our website and we believe have been driven by word of mouth recommendations from current customers 
our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to generate demand for harpin protein based products in the home and garden market  specifically among the general public  resellers or businesses that sell the products to the general public and businesses that incorporate harpin protein based products into existing or new products to be sold to the general public 
to this end  our direct and indirect sales operations must increase market awareness of our home and garden business and our products to generate increased revenue 
however  as noted above  we have not invested significant resources in  and do not currently intend to significantly increase our investment toward the development of our home and garden business 
at march   we had only one part time employee fully focused  and one full time employee partially focused  on sales and marketing our home and garden products 
we have no current plans to increase our sales and marketing capabilities in the home and garden market  and we expect to continue to generate a substantial portion of our sales through our website based on positive word of mouth 
our sales and marketing personnel may not successfully compete against the sales and marketing operations of our current and future competitors that have greater resources and more established relationships with distributors  retailers and growers 
if we are not successful in building greater market awareness and generating increased sales  our future results of operations will be adversely affected 
if we fail to generate sufficient sales from our home and garden business to cover our operating costs  our business operations and prospects  including our ability to explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards  will be adversely affected  creating substantial doubt about our ability to stay in business 
we may be unable to establish or maintain successful relationships with independent distributors and retailers  which could adversely affect our sales and our ability to generate revenue from our home and garden business 
our ability to sell our home and garden products will be significantly impaired if we fail to develop and maintain our distribution channels 
we will need to increase sales to independent distributors and retailers in the home and garden market to expand sales of our products 
we have engaged several independent distributors and retailers for the distribution and sale of our home and garden products 
our future revenue growth will depend in large part on our success in establishing and maintaining these sales and distribution channels 
we are continuing to develop our distribution network and we may be unable to establish or maintain these relationships in a timely or cost effective manner 
moreover  we cannot assure you that the distributors and retailers on which we rely will focus adequate resources on selling these products or will be successful in selling them 
many of our potential distributors and retailers are in the business of distributing and sometimes manufacturing other  possibly competing  plant health products for the home and garden market and may perceive our products as a threat to various product lines currently being manufactured or distributed by them 
in addition  the distributors and retailers may earn higher margins by selling competing products or combinations of competing products 
if we are unable to establish or maintain successful relationships with independent distributors and retailers  we may need to further develop our own distribution and sales and marketing capabilities  which would be expensive and time consuming and the success of which would be uncertain 
we currently have approximately ten key distributors of our home and garden products 
if any distributor or retailer that purchases a significant amount of our home and garden products were to discontinue purchasing our products any time  our sales would be adversely affected 
see item business sales  marketing and distribution 
in addition  the failure of any of these distributors and retailers  or any other distributor or retailer to which we extend a significant amount of credit  to pay its account now or in the future may harm our operating results 
the market for home and garden products is competitive and we may not have the resources required to compete effectively 
the high level of competition in these markets may result in price reductions  reduced margins or the inability of our products to achieve market acceptance 
the market for home and garden plant protection and plant health products is intensely competitive  rapidly changing and undergoing consolidation 
we may be unable to compete successfully against our current or future competitors  which may result in price reductions  reduced margins or the inability to achieve market acceptance of our current or any future products 
we expect competition within the plant protection and plant health industry to intensify as regulatory pressures on traditional chemical solutions increase 
this may occur as advances in plant protection and disease resistance technologies become more widely known 
the plant health industry is dominated by multinational chemical and pharmaceutical companies  including the scotts miracle grow company  syngenta ag  basf ag  and bayer ag 
many of the large chemical pesticide companies are also developing products that they believe are less environmentally harmful than traditional chemical pesticides and that may directly compete with our current or future home and garden products 
syngenta ag  a large multinational company  manufactures a product that is designed to induce disease resistant systems in plants 
other small companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research  seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery  research  development and marketing of products similar to ours 
many of our current and potential future competitors have significantly more capital  research and development  regulatory  manufacturing  distribution  sales  marketing  human and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products  receive greater resources and support from independent distributors  initiate or withstand substantial price competition or take advantage of acquisition or other opportunities more readily 
furthermore  large chemical and pharmaceutical companies have a more diversified product offering than we do  which may give them an advantage in meeting customer needs by enabling them to offer integrated solutions to plant protection and plant health in the home and garden market 
we are unable to compete with phc s harpin protein technology business until after february  pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  we have agreed that we will not engage in or own or control any interest except as a passive investor of less than of the outstanding equity interests of a public company in any entity that directly competes with phc s harpin protein technology business until after february  the asset purchase agreement specifically provides that our home and garden business is not deemed to compete with phc s harpin protein technology business 
the noncompetition covenant also does not apply to any future activities undertaken by us relating to the development  testing  manufacture  sale and or distribution of synthetic chemistry pesticides for or in the worldwide agricultural  horticultural and retail markets 
however  this noncompetition covenant may limit our ability to pursue businesses opportunities  including  for example  the sale of our remaining business or the acquisition of other businesses that might otherwise improve our financial results or enable us to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
our home and garden business currently depends on products that are based on the same new technology  and our commercialization of those products may not be successful 
for the immediately foreseeable future  we will be dependent on the successful commercialization in the home and garden market of three products messenger  messenger seed treatment and mightyplant with messenger gold  the latter of which was introduced into the home and garden market in the second quarter of which are based on the same new technology 
substantially all of our sales in the home and garden market have come from our first harpin protein and from a single product  messenger 
these sales have been limited and quite small in comparison to the size of the overall home and garden market 
our current and any new home and garden products we develop may not be commercially successful and may not prove effective or economically viable 
in addition  because our home and garden products have not been put to widespread use over significant periods of time  no assurance can be given that adverse consequences might not result from their use  such as soil or other environmental degradation  the development of negative effects on animals or plants or reduced benefits in terms of plant health or protection 
a variety of factors will determine the success of our market development and commercialization efforts and the rate and extent of acceptance of our current or any future home and garden products  including our ability to implement and maintain an appropriate pricing policy and general economic conditions in the home and garden market  including weather conditions and the extent to which the general public and regulatory authorities accept new plant and seed protection and plant health products developed through biotechnology 
our inability to obtain regulatory approvals  or to comply with ongoing and changing regulatory requirements  could delay or prevent sales of our current or any future home and garden products 
the sale and use of plant health products containing harpin proteins are extensively regulated by the epa and or state  local and foreign governmental authorities 
these regulations substantially increase the cost and time associated with bringing our current and any future home and garden products to market 
all epa federal registrations were transferred to phc in connection with the sale of our harpin protein technology while state registrations and permits are not transferable 
we currently sell our home and garden products pursuant to an month grace period during which we may continue to sell our home and garden products in those jurisdictions for which we previously had obtained authorization 
we registered our own regulatory approvals under the epa s me too registration process and will subsequently register our home and garden products in the states and other jurisdictions  as necessary 
if we do not continue to receive the necessary governmental approvals to market these products  obtain required approvals in the future  or if the regulatory authorities revoke our approvals or grant them subject to restrictions on their use  we may be unable to sell our home and garden products and our business may fail 
we are required to obtain regulatory approval from certain state and foreign regulatory authorities before we market our products in those jurisdictions 
some of these jurisdictions may apply different criteria than the epa in connection with their approval processes 
although we are currently authorized to sell messenger for virtually all home and garden uses in states  and in california for disease management use on strawberries  grapes and fruiting vegetables  we may not be able to obtain future registrations for current or future products or maintain these registrations 
even if we obtain all necessary regulatory approvals to market and sell our current and any future products  these products will be subject to continuing review and extensive regulatory requirements 
the epa  as well as state and foreign governmental authorities  could withdraw a previously approved product from the market upon discovery of new information  including an inability or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unanticipated problems with the product  or for other reasons 
in addition  federal  state and foreign regulations relating to plant protection products developed through biotechnology are subject to public concerns and political circumstances and  as a result  regulations have changed and may change substantially in the future 
these changes may result in limitations on the manufacturing  marketing or use of our current and any future home and garden products 
we may be exposed to product liability claims  which could adversely affect our operations 
we may be held liable or incur costs to settle product liability claims if the products we sell cause injury or are found unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing  sale or use 
these risks exist even with respect to any products that have received  or may in the future receive  regulatory approval  registration or clearance for commercial use 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to avoid product liability exposure 
we currently maintain product liability insurance at levels we believe are sufficient and consistent with industry standards for companies at our stage of development 
our product liability insurance may not be adequate  and  at any time  it is possible that such insurance coverage may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
a product liability claim could result in liability to us greater than our assets and insurance coverage 
moreover  even if we have adequate insurance coverage  product liability claims or recalls could result in negative publicity or force us to devote significant time and attention to matters other than those that arise in the normal course of business 
rapid changes in technology could render our current or any future products we may develop unmarketable or obsolete 
we are engaged in an industry characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological development 
our competitors  which generally have substantially greater technological and financial resources than we do  may develop plant protection and plant health technologies and products that are more effective than ours or that render harpin protein based technology and our home and garden products obsolete or uncompetitive 
to be successful  we will need to continually enhance our current and any future products and develop and market new products that keep pace with new technological and industry developments 
if we are unable to retain our existing personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
we are highly dependent on the efforts and abilities of bradley s 
powell  our president and chief financial officer 
our failure to retain mr 
powell would seriously disrupt our operations and our ability to explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards  and increase our costs by forcing us to use more expensive outside consultants and impair our ability to generate revenue 
if our customer base and revenue grow  we may need to hire additional qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  and we may not be able to attract  train  integrate or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel if we need to do so in the future 
risks related to our business plan to utilize tax loss carryforwards our business objective of realizing potential value from our tax loss carryforwards is highly speculative and subject to numerous material uncertainties 
our business strategy is to use the proceeds from the sale of our harpin protein technology to fund the working capital requirements of our home and garden business while we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
the strategy is extremely speculative and subject to a large number of risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in this section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we have conducted only limited analysis of our ability to utilize our tax loss carryforwards and have drawn no final conclusions about the viability of this strategy 
in order to confirm whether there are opportunities to realize potential value from our tax loss carryforwards  we have engaged legal and investment banking professionals to validate the underlying assumptions related to our tax loss carryforwards and analyze and provide advice on the options that may be available to preserve and maximize the potential use of our deferred tax assets  as well as on potential limitations and risks of such utilization strategy 
this will continue to be an expensive and time consuming process  and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from our home and garden business or otherwise attract sufficient capital to support the process for its duration 
additionally  we may conclude that the potential utilization of our tax loss carryforwards is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders 
a business plan for the utilization of our tax loss carryforwards may not be successfully implemented or may not result in any increase in shareholder value 
we may not be able to realize value from our tax loss carryforwards 
our total us federal tax net operating loss carryforwards were approximately million at december  and expire between and the company s total foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards were approximately million at december  of which million expires between and and does not expire 
we have total net operating loss carryforwards in states that range between million to  per state and expire between and our total general business credit carryforwards were approximately million at december  and expire between and in the event we were to undergo an ownership change as defined in section of the code  our net tax loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations  which could reduce  eliminate  or defer the utilization of these losses 
based upon an analysis completed during the third quarter of of past changes in the company s ownership  the company believes that it has experienced ownership changes as defined under section on march  and october  and absent any other ownership changes in the future  there are no significant limitations on our future ability to use tax loss carryforwards generated prior to those dates 
we do not believe that the sale to phc resulted in another ownership change that would further limit our future ability to use tax loss carryforwards generated after october because it was a sale of assets 
however  the irs or some other taxing authority may disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced other such ownership changes or that the sale of assets resulted in an ownership change 
in such case  our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be severely limited 
if the sale of assets to phc results in an ownership change as defined in section of the code  our tax loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income could be severely limited and the tax loss carryforwards may expire as a result of the limitation 
if an ownership change does not occur as a result of the sale to phc  there is still the potential for an ownership change to occur under section as a result of future changes in stock ownership 
generally  an ownership change occurs if one or more shareholders  each of whom owns or more in value of a corporation s stock  increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders at any time during the preceding three year period 
for example  if a single shareholder owning of our stock acquired an additional of our stock in a three year period  a change of ownership would occur 
similarly  if ten persons  none of whom owned our stock  each acquired slightly over of our stock within a three year period so that such persons own  in the aggregate  more than an ownership change would occur 
ownership of stock is determined by certain constructive ownership rules which can attribute ownership of stock owned by entities such as estates  trusts  corporations  and partnerships to the ultimate indirect owner 
for purposes of this rule  all holders who each own less than of a corporation s stock are generally treated together as one or  in certain cases  more than one shareholder 
transactions in the public markets among shareholders owning less than of the equity securities generally are not included in the calculation 
special rules can result in the treatment of options including warrants or other similar interests as having been exercised if such treatment would result in an ownership change 
as we explore whether there may be opportunities to utilize our tax loss carryforwards  due to the importance of avoiding a future ownership change under the tax laws  we will be limited in our ability to issue additional stock in the future to provide capital for our business 
we would only be able to issue such additional stock in a manner that would not cause an ownership change  for purposes of these rules  and thus our ability to access the equity markets could be restricted 
finally  in addition to section  certain other statutory provisions and common law doctrine could limit our opportunities to realize potential value from  or otherwise adversely affect our ability to preserve and utilize  our tax loss carryforwards 
we may not be able to use our tax loss carryforwards because we may not generate taxable income 
the use of our tax loss carryforwards is subject to uncertainty because it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income we generate 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income  if any  in future years to use the tax loss carryforwards before they expire 
we believe that our ability to achieve profitability may depend in substantial part on our ability to identify and acquire suitable businesses on favorable terms  so that we can increase our revenues and generate new income 
we may be unable to identify or complete any such future acquisitions or such transactions may not be successful or enable us to utilize our tax loss carryforwards 
we may seek additional capital from time to time  including through the sale of stock or other securities  which may result in dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  as noted above  the provisions of the code and certain applicable irs regulations will limit the number of shares of stock we can sell from time to time without causing a limitation on our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax obligations 
the irs could challenge the amount of our tax loss carryforwards 
the amount of our tax loss carryforwards has not been audited or otherwise validated by the irs 
the irs could challenge the amount of our tax loss carryforwards  which could significantly reduce our tax loss carryforwards 
in addition  calculating whether an ownership change has occurred is subject to uncertainty  both because of the complexity and ambiguity of section of the code and because of limitations on a publicly traded company s knowledge as to the ownership of  and transactions in  its securities 
finally  certain other statutory provisions and common law doctrine could limit our opportunities to realize potential value from  or otherwise adversely affect our ability to preserve and utilize  our tax loss carryforwards 
therefore  the calculation of the amount of our tax loss carryforwards may be changed as a result of a challenge by a governmental authority or our learning of new information about the ownership of  and transactions in  our securities 
possible changes in legislation could negatively affect our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our tax loss carryforwards 
the rules relating to us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the us treasury department  resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes 
revisions in us federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely impair our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our tax loss carryforwards 
limits on ownership of our common stock and our shareholder rights plan could have an adverse consequence to you and could limit your opportunity to receive a premium on our stock 
as noted above  we must avoid an ownership change under section of the code in order to potentially retain the ability to use our tax loss carryforwards to offset future income 
this means that a potential buyer of our stock might be deterred from acquiring our common stock while we still have significant tax losses being carried forward  because such an acquisition might trigger an ownership change and severely impair our ability to use our tax losses against future income 
thus  this potential tax situation could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control and  therefore  could adversely affect our shareholders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for our common stock in connection with a change in control 
to further deter a potential buyer of our stock from accumulating an ownership position that could jeopardize our ability to utilize our net operating tax loss carryforwards  in june  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock 
this shareholder rights plan is described in more detail below under the risk factor titled certain provisions in our charter document and washington law  as well as our shareholder rights plan  could discourage a change of control or make it difficult to change the composition of directors and management 
the shareholder rights plan may make it more difficult for other persons or entities  without the approval of our board of directors  to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock  or to launch other takeover attempts that a shareholder might consider to be in such shareholder s best interests 
the shareholder rights plan also may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
the shareholder rights plan could also result in an ownership change under section of the code which may severely impair our ability to use our tax losses against future income 
risks related to our common stock we may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market if we do not satisfy continued listing requirements 
our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq capital market 
on march   the closing sales price of our common stock was 
if we fail to meet any of the continued listing standards of the nasdaq capital market  our common stock will be delisted 
nasdaq s continued listing standards include specifically enumerated criteria  such as a minimum closing bid price  shareholders equity of million or market value of publicly held shares of million and  shares of common stock publicly held and market value of publicly held shares of at least million  as well as additional or more stringent criteria that may be applied in the exercise of nasdaq s discretionary authority to maintain the quality of and public confidence in the nasdaq market  prevent fraudulent and manipulative practices  promote just and equitable principles of trade  and protect investors and the public interest 
for example  we failed to satisfy nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement on more than one occasion over the past few years 
if we were unable to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement  our common stock would have been delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
each time we were able to cure the failure to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement and avert having our common stock delisted 
however  we have no assurance that nasdaq will not in the future seek to delist us for our failure to meet the enumerated conditions for continued listing 
if our common stock were delisted from the nasdaq capital market  you may find it difficult to dispose of your shares 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq capital market  trading of our common stock most likely will be conducted in the over the counter market on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the pink sheets or the otc bulletin board 
such trading will reduce the market liquidity of our common stock 
as a result  an investor would find it more difficult to dispose of  or obtain accurate quotations for the price of  our common stock 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq capital market and the trading price remains below per share  trading in our common stock might also become subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of  which require additional disclosure by broker dealers in connection with any trade involving a stock defined as a penny stock generally  any equity security not listed on a national securities exchange or quoted on nasdaq that has a market price of less than per share  subject to certain exceptions 
many brokerage firms are reluctant to recommend low priced stocks to their clients 
moreover  various regulations and policies restrict the ability of shareholders to borrow against or margin low priced stocks  and declines in the stock price below certain levels may trigger unexpected margin calls 
additionally  because brokers commissions on low priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher priced stocks  the current price of the common stock can result in an individual shareholder paying transaction costs that represent a higher percentage of total share value than would be the case if our share price were higher 
this factor may also limit the willingness of institutions to purchase our common stock 
finally  the additional burdens imposed upon broker dealers by these requirements could discourage broker dealers from facilitating trades in our common stock  which could severely limit the market liquidity of the stock and the ability of investors to trade our common stock 
our financial results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
numerous factors will contribute to the unpredictability of our operating results 
in particular  our sales are expected to be highly seasonal 
sales of home and garden products depend on planting and growing seasons  climatic conditions and economic and other variables  which we expect to result in substantial fluctuations in our quarterly sales and earnings 
for example  weather related events such as droughts and floods  severe heat and frost  hail  tornadoes and hurricanes could decrease demand for our current and any future products  and have an adverse impact on our operating results from quarter to quarter 
in addition  most of our expenses  such as employee compensation  are relatively fixed 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales 
as a result  any shortfall in sales relative to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
other factors may also contribute to the unpredictability of our operating results  including the amount of our home and garden products carried in inventory by distributors and retailers  the amount of free product to be given to retailers  the size and timing of significant customer transactions and the delay or deferral of customer use of our products 
for example  customers may purchase large quantities of our products under a promotion in a particular quarter to store and use over long periods of time  or time their purchases to coincide with the availability of capital  either of which may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results for a particular quarter or year 
due to these and other factors  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one period as an indication of our future performance 
in future periods  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
certain provisions in our charter documents and washington law  as well as our shareholder rights plan  could discourage a change of control or make it difficult to change the composition of directors and management 
provisions of our charter documents and washington law  as well as our shareholders rights plan  may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change of control  even if this change would be beneficial to our shareholders 
in addition  some of these provisions may make it difficult for shareholders to remover or replace our current directors and management in the event our shareholders believe this would be in the best interests of the company and our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors  stagger our board of directors  making it more difficult to elect a majority of the directors on our board and preventing our directors from being removed without cause  limit who may call special meetings of shareholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by shareholders at shareholder meetings 
washington law imposes restrictions on certain transactions between a corporation and significant shareholders 
chapter b 
of the washington business corporation act prohibits a target corporation  with some exceptions  from engaging in particular significant business transactions with an acquiring person  which is defined as a person or group of persons that beneficially owns or more of the voting securities of the target corporation  for a period of five years after the date the acquiring person first became a beneficial owner of voting securities of the target corporation  unless the business transaction or the acquisition of shares is approved by a majority of the members of the target corporation s board of directors prior to the time the acquiring person first became a beneficial owner of the target corporation s voting securities 
prohibited business transactions include  among other things a merger or consolidation with  disposition of assets to  or issuance or redemption of stock to or from the acquiring person  termination of or more of the employees of the target corporation  or receipt by the acquiring person of any disproportionate benefit as a shareholder 
after the five year period  a significant business transaction may occur if it complies with fair price provisions specified in the statute 
a corporation may not opt out of this statute 
this provision may have an antitakeover effect with respect to transactions that our board does not approve in advance 
in june  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of our common stock 
in addition to helping to protect the utilization of our net operating tax loss carryforwards by deterring a potential buyer of our stock from accumulating an ownership position that could jeopardize our ability to utilize our net operarting tax loss carryforwards  the shareholder rights plan is also designed to ensure that our board of directors has adequate time to consider any proposed transaction involving eden bioscience and that all of our shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of a proposed takeover of eden bioscience 
the rights will be exercisable only if a person or group acquires  or in the case of any person or group that owned beneficially more than of our outstanding common stock on june   or in the case of sf holding corp  an existing investor that owned in excess of of our outstanding common stock on june  or more of our outstanding common stock or launches or announces an intent to launch a tender or exchange offer that could result in the offeror becoming the beneficial owner of  or  as the case may be  or more of our common stock 
each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one hundredth of a share of a series of preferred stock called series r participating cumulative preferred stock at an exercise price of if a person or group acquires  or  as the case may be  or more of our outstanding common stock  each right will entitle its holder other than the acquiring person or group to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  the number of shares of our common stock having a market value of twice the exercise price 
in addition  if we are acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction after a person has acquired or  as the case may be  or more of our outstanding common stock  each right will entitle its holder to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value of twice the exercise price 
following the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of or  as the case may be  or more of our outstanding common stock and before the acquisition of or more of this common stock  our board of directors may exchange all or part of the rights other than rights owned by the acquiring person or group for a consideration per right consisting of one half of the common stock that would be issuable upon the exercise of one right 
alternatively  the rights are redeemable for one cent per right at the option of the board of directors  prior to the acquisition by a person or group of beneficial ownership of or  as the case may be  or more of our outstanding common stock 
the shareholder rights plan may make it more difficult for other persons or entities  without the approval of our board of directors  to make a tender offer or otherwise acquire substantial amounts of our common stock  or to launch other takeover attempts that a shareholder might consider to be in such shareholder s best interests 
the shareholder rights plan also may limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

market information our common stock has been listed on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol eden since october  from our initial public offering on september  through october   our stock was listed on the nasdaq global market formerly the nasdaq national market under the symbol eden 
prior to that time  there was no public market for our common stock 
on april   we amended our restated articles of incorporation to reduce the number of authorized shares of common stock from  to  and to effect a for reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock 
the reverse stock split was effective at pm  pacific time  on april  and our common stock began trading as adjusted for the reverse stock split on april  as a result of the reverse stock split  each three outstanding shares of common stock were exchanged for one share of common stock  with cash issued for any fractional shares  and the total number of shares outstanding was reduced from approximately million shares to approximately million shares

unless otherwise indicated  we have retroactively adjusted all common stock related amounts in this report to reflect our one for three reverse stock split effective april  and an additional one for three reverse stock split effective february  overview we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in  and million in on february   we sold our proprietary harpin protein based technology and substantially all of our assets used in our worldwide agricultural and horticultural markets to phc for million and assumption of certain liabilities by phc  including all of our obligations under our office and manufacturing facility lease  under the license agreement with cornell research foundation crf and under our change in control agreement with dr 
zhongmin wei 
we believe that this sale will enable us to reduce our future operating losses and liabilities  generate cash for our home and garden business and preserve the potential future value of our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
as described in more detail below  we retained the right to our cash  accounts receivable and assets relating to our home and garden business 
as part of the closing  we entered into a license and supply agreement with phc  pursuant to which phc granted us an exclusive worldwide right and license to sell harpin protein based products for the protection of plants and seed and the promotion of overall plant health in the home and garden market and a royalty free  exclusive worldwide license to use the messenger  mightyplant and harp n tek trademarks in connection with the sale of our home and garden products 
under the license and supply agreement  phc will supply us harpin proteins and harpin protein based products for our home and garden business 
we retained all liabilities associated with the home and garden business and all liabilities associated with the harpin protein technology that occurred or existed prior to february  that were not specifically assumed by phc 
our business strategy following the sale is to use any revenue generated by our home and garden business to support our continued operations while we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
we expect to incur additional net losses as we proceed with our home and garden business and as we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets 
sale of harpin protein technology to plant health care on february   under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  we sold our harpin protein technology to phc for  in cash  net of transaction costs incurred after january  totaling  a promissory note in the principal amount of  payable on december  and the assumption by phc of certain of the liabilities relating to or arising out of our harpin protein technology totaling  the promissory note had an interest rate of per annum and was paid in full on december  harpin protein technology includes substantially all of our assets used in the creation of plant health technology incorporating harpin proteins and the manufacture of biopesticide  plant health and nutrient products utilizing the harpin protein technology 
these assets include all intellectual property  contracts including our license agreement with the crf and our office and manufacturing facility lease  equipment and inventory related to our worldwide agricultural and horticultural markets 
as a result of the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc  we believe that the discussion below regarding our results of operations for each of the two years ended december  and  except as it relates to our home and garden business  is not indicative of or relevant to an understanding of our future financial results and operations 
with respect to our financial condition and results of operations in  the sale of our harpin protein technology had the following effects net product sales to the agricultural and horticultural markets decreased to  in from  in cost of goods sold decreased significantly as a result of the decrease in product sales and the elimination of idle capacity charges after february  research and development expenses decreased to  in from  in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased significantly in compared to cash and cash equivalents increased by  on february  this increase was offset by the payment of transaction costs totaling  incurred and recorded in the first three months of approximately  of transaction costs were incurred and recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in 
cash and cash equivalents also increased and other long term assets decreased by  for the release of restricted cash and return of deposit by the facility lease landlord 
on june   cash and cash equivalents increased and note receivable decreased by  as a result of collecting a portion of the note receivable from phc 
on december   cash and cash equivalents increased and note receivable decreased by  as a result of collecting the remaining portion of the note receivable and interest from phc 
current inventory decreased by  for inventory sold to phc 
we also sold  of finished goods to phc under our independent distribution agreement with phc 
the remaining inventory consists of raw materials and finished goods used for our home and garden business 
other current assets decreased by  for equipment classified as held for sale and sold to phc 
property and equipment decreased by  for assets sold to phc 
current accrued liabilities decreased by  due to phc s assumption of these liabilities 
other long term liabilities decreased to zero due to phc s assumption of our office and manufacturing facility lease liabilities recorded for rent expense in excess of rent payments totaling  and asset retirement obligation of  and our  liability to crf 
as of february   the cumulative translation adjustment related to our european subsidiary totaling  was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and reported as part of the gain on sale of harpin protein technology as this subsidiary was substantially liquidated as a result of the sale to phc 
the sale of harpin protein technology to phc resulted in a gain calculated as follows cash portion of purchase price promissory note portion of purchase price less transaction costs incurred after january  assets sold to phc inventory equipment held for sale property and equipment held and used liabilities assumed by phc accrued liabilities other long term liabilities recognition of cumulative translation adjustment gain on sale of assets to phc additionally  future minimum lease payments under the non cancelable office and manufacturing facility lease totaling  in   in and  in were assumed by phc as of february  all of our rights  liabilities and obligations under the exclusive worldwide license agreement with crf for certain patents  patent applications and biological material relating to harpin proteins and related technology have been assigned to phc 
the license agreement required funding of certain research and development activities at cornell university and payment of a royalty on net sales of products that incorporate the licensed technology  subject to a  minimum annual royalty payment 
effective july   the license agreement was amended to establish a development fund at crf to advance harpin technology and reduced the minimum obligation required to maintain the rights under the license agreement to contributions to the development fund of  in each of the  and license years 
results of operations revenues product sales revenue through resulted primarily from sales of messenger sts  n hibit  proact  mightyplant and other related products hereafter referred to collectively as harp n tek products primarily to distributors in the agricultural markets in the united states and spain 
revenues from product sales are recognized when a the product is delivered to independent distributors  b we have satisfied all of our significant obligations and c any acceptance provisions or other contingencies or arrangements have been satisfied  including whether collection is reasonably assured 
if acceptance provisions or contingencies exist  revenue is recognized after such provisions or contingencies have been satisfied 
as part of the analysis of whether all of our significant obligations have been satisfied or situations where acceptance provisions or other contingencies or arrangements exist  we consider the following elements  among others sales terms and arrangements  historical experience and current incentive programs 
our distributor arrangements provided no price protection or product return rights 
gross product sales by geographical region were year ended december  united states spain other regions product sales as a result of the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc in february  we have ceased selling products to customers in the agricultural and horticultural markets and our gross product sales revenue from distributors in these markets were  in  a decrease of  from  in gross product sales revenues were  in  which decreased  from  in the decrease in is a result primarily of a significant decline in sales of messenger sts in spain offset by an increase in sales of proact in the united states 
we believe the cause of lower sales in spain is the higher than expected levels of product in the distribution channel 
sales of new products produced over of total gross revenue in sales in were made to distributors  three of which accounted for an aggregate of of net product sales 
sales in were made to distributors  five of which accounted for an aggregate of of net product sales 
we sell our home and garden products to distributors  retailers and directly to consumers over the internet 
sales to consumers in the home and garden market in the united states totaled  of gross product sales in   of gross product sales in and  of gross product sales in we believe the decrease in sales volume compared to was due to lower spending on personnel  marketing and advertising  higher levels of product inventory in the distribution channel and poor weather conditions in the first half of our only two full time employees in home and garden sales and marketing resigned effective on july  and august  although we intend to continue to operate our home and garden business with our remaining one full time and two part time employees  we do not currently intend to fill these positions at this time and do not intend to significantly increase our investment toward the development of this business 
we expect this to negatively impact our sales during in february  we received approval to sell messenger in spain 
we initiated marketing activities in march  but the approval was not received in time to meet initial sales activity 
in order to ensure that an adequate supply of messenger was quickly disbursed in the new distribution channel and to limit the amount of working capital required by our new distributors at this early stage of introduction  we granted flexible and or extended payment terms to distributors in this new market 
because of this combination of factors  revenues from product deliveries to certain distributors were deferred and are recognized as payment is received 
we recognized net revenue of  in   in and  in from product deliveries when payment was received 
gross revenues of approximately  was deferred at december  and will be recognized if payment is received 
due to the growing seasons in the united states  we expect usage of our home and garden products to be highly seasonal 
based on the recommended application timing  we expect the second quarter to be the most significant period of use 
our home and garden product sales to distributors are also expected to be seasonal 
however  actual timing of orders received from distributors will depend on many factors  including the amounts of our products in distributors inventories 
sales allowances product sales revenues are reported net of applicable sales allowances  as follows year ended december  gross product sales sales allowances elimination of previously recorded sales allowance liabilities product sales  net of sales allowances sales allowances represent allowances granted to independent distributors for sales and marketing support and are based on the terms of the distribution agreements or other arrangements 
sales allowances are estimated and accrued when the related product sales are recognized or when services are provided and are paid in accordance with the terms of the then current distributor program agreements or other arrangements 
distributor program agreements expire annually  generally on december sales allowances for were zero due to the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc 
sales allowances related to sales totaled  a decrease of  from  in sales allowances as a percentage of gross product sales revenue were in and in sales allowances also included the reductions by in   in and  in of sales allowance liabilities recognized in prior periods that were not paid because actual amounts earned by distributors were less than amounts previously estimated 
as a result of the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc  we expect sales allowances to be less than of sales in cost of goods sold cost of goods sold includes the cost of products sold  idle capacity charges  royalty expense  shipping and handling and other costs necessary to deliver products to customers  and the cost of products used for promotional purposes 
cost of goods sold was  in  a decrease of  from  in  which decreased  from  in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to lower sales volumes in our home and garden business and lower sales volumes  idle capacity charges  royalty expense  shipping and handling costs and products used for promotional purposes as a result of the sale of harpin protein technology to phc 
royalty expenses and idle capacity charges ceased as of february  the decrease in compared to is a result of less product waste from manufacturing activities  lower idle capacity charges and fewer products used for promotions 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  field trial  laboratory  regulatory  patent and facility expenses 
research and development expenses totaled  in  a decrease of  from  in  which decreased  from  in the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc 
the decrease in compared to was primarily a result of lower personnel  facility  depreciation and field trial costs 
as a result of the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc  we do not expect to incur any research and development expenses in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related expenses for sales and marketing  executive and administrative personnel  advertising  marketing and professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled  in  a decrease of  from  in  which decreased  from  in the decrease in compared to resulted primarily from reductions in personnel  advertising and marketing expenses  facility costs and the sale of harpin protein technology to phc and was partially offset by supplemental payment compensation to bradley s 
powell  our president and chief financial officer  totaling  and a  payment made to stephens inc to act as our exclusive financial advisor in connection with our efforts to effect one or more business combinations 
the decrease in compared to resulted primarily from reductions in personnel  advertising and marketing expenses and facility costs  offset by an increase in legal fees associated with sale of our harpin protein technology to phc totaling approximately  our business strategy moving forward is to use any revenues generated by our home and garden business to support our operations while we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
as described below  we engaged legal professionals to validate the underlying assumptions related to our tax loss carryforwards and analyze and provide advice on the options that may be available to preserve and maximize the potential use of our deferred tax assets  as well as on potential limitations and risks of such utilization strategy 
we expect this to be an expensive and time consuming process  and we may not generate revenue from our home and garden business or otherwise attract capital to support the process for its duration 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense was recognized in the consolidated financial statements for granted stock options 
compensation expense recognized included stock options granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  and the portion vesting in the period for options granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas as of december   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to nonvested stock options was  and we expected to recognize this amount in total stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and was  and  respectively 
prior to the january  adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  because the stock option exercise price equaled the market price on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized for stock based compensation 
results for prior periods have not been restated  as provided for under the modified prospective method 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
options generally become exercisable over a three or four year period and  if not exercised or earlier terminated  expire ten years after the grant date 
the majority of our employees participate in our stock option program 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of our stock 
for the year ended december   the expected term of each award granted was calculated using the simplified method in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
no stock options were granted in prior to january   the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
loss on impairment of equipment and leasehold improvements we periodically review the carrying values of our property and equipment to determine whether such assets have been impaired 
an impairment loss must be recorded pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the use of such assets are less than their carrying value 
the determination of expected undiscounted net cash flows requires us to make many estimates  projections and assumptions  including the lives of the assets  future sales and expense levels  additional capital investments or expenditures necessary to maintain the assets  industry market trends and general and industry economic conditions 
our property and equipment consisted primarily of assets used to manufacture and sell our products and assets used in our research and administration 
for the purpose of assessing asset impairment  we grouped all of these assets together in one asset group because our administration and research supported our manufacturing and sales activities and do not have a separate identifiable cash flow 
in the first half of  we continued to incur losses from operations and actual sales  and growth rates for the first half of were significantly lower than expected 
in reviewing our assets for impairment in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended june   we compared the carrying value of such assets to updated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of this asset group 
as a result of continuing operating losses and lower sales and growth rates in the first half of compared to forecasts  the carrying value of the group of assets exceeded undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of this asset group 
consequently  we concluded on july   that a charge for impairment to our equipment and leasehold improvements was required and a  impairment loss was recognized at june  we estimated the fair value of equipment using an orderly liquidation method and leasehold improvements were estimated to have zero fair value 
the impairment charge did not result in future cash expenditures 
in december  we completed an efficiency analysis of our manufacturing processes  including an assessment of all manufacturing equipment and its usefulness in future manufacturing operations 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a loss of  on equipment that we determined would not be used in future manufacturing operations and would be sold or disposed 
the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell of the equipment to be sold totaled  at december   and is included in other current assets on the balance sheet 
loss on write down of inventory in reviewing the impact of the sale of our harpin technology for potential asset impairments  we compared the carrying value at december  of assets sold to consideration received from phc and recorded liabilities assumed by phc on february  based on this review  the carrying value of inventory sold to phc exceeded the consideration received from phc and recorded liabilities assumed by phc and we recorded a  write down of inventory as of december  lease termination loss on september   we entered into an amendment of lease and termination agreement with the landlord to terminate the lease of  square feet of research and office space in bothell  washington 
the lease originally expired january  average annual rent and operating costs under the lease were approximately million 
the termination was effective as of august  approximately  square feet of the space subject to the lease was subleased 
the sublease had an initial term that expired in december average annual rent and operating costs under the sublease were approximately million 
in connection with the amendment of lease and termination agreement  the existing sublease was transferred to the landlord 
the lease termination resulted in a loss totaling  the lease termination loss is comprised of a termination fee totaling  consisting of  cash and the forfeiture of a  security deposit  other costs  and an asset impairment loss on leasehold improvements and equipment at the leased facility totaling approximately  offset by the write off of liabilities recorded for accrued losses on facility subleases and rent expense in excess of rent payments totaling approximately  gain on property and equipment gain on sale of property and equipment represents the amount of sales proceeds over the recorded value of property and equipment at the time of sale 
gain on sale of investment in the first quarter of  we sold a minority stock investment for  that resulted in a gain of  interest income interest income consists primarily of earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and note receivable from phc 
interest income totaled  in  an increase of  from  in  which decreased  from  in the increase in over was primarily due to higher average cash balances available for investment as a result of proceeds from the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc in and interest income on the promissory note from phc 
the decrease in compared to was due to significantly lower average cash balances available for investment offset by slightly higher interest rates in income taxes we have generated a net loss from operations for each period since we began doing business 
as of december   we had accumulated approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for us federal income tax purposes  which expire between and  and net operating loss carryforwards in us states that range between million to  per state and expire between and our total us general business credit carryforwards were approximately million and expire between and we have also accumulated approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards in mexico that expire between and and approximately million in france  of which  expires in and million does not expire 
we have provided a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets because of the significant uncertainty surrounding our ability to realize value on such assets 
our business strategy is to use any revenue generated by our home and garden business to support our continued operations while we explore whether there may be opportunities to realize potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
the strategy is extremely speculative and subject to a large number of risks and uncertainties including those set forth under the heading risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
we have conducted limited analysis of our ability to utilize our tax loss carryforwards and have drawn no final conclusions about the viability of this strategy 
in order to confirm whether there are opportunities to realize potential value from our tax loss carryforwards  we engaged legal and investment banking professionals during to validate the underlying assumptions related to our tax loss carryforwards and analyze and provide advice on the options that may be available to preserve and maximize the potential use of our tax loss carryforwards  as well as on potential limitations and risks of such utilization strategy 
during the third quarter of  we completed an analysis of past changes in our ownership 
we believe that eden bioscience has experienced ownership changes as defined under section of the irs code on march  and october  and  absent any other ownership changes in the future  there are no significant limitations on our future ability to use us tax loss carryforwards generated prior to those dates 
in september  we engaged stephens inc to act as our exclusive financial advisor in connection with our efforts to effect one or more business combinations 
this will continue to be an expensive and time consuming process  and we may not generate sufficient revenue from our home and garden business or otherwise attract sufficient capital to support the process for its duration 
if we were to undergo an ownership change as defined in section of the code  our net tax loss and general business credit carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations  which could reduce  eliminate  or defer the utilization of these losses 
based upon an analysis completed during the third quarter of of past changes in our ownership  we believe we have experienced ownership changes as defined under section on march  and october  and absent any other ownership changes in the future  there are no significant limitations on our future ability to use tax loss carryforwards generated prior to those dates 
we do not believe that the sale to phc resulted in another ownership change that would further limit our future ability to use tax loss carryforwards generated after october because it was a sale of assets 
however  the irs or some other taxing authority may disagree with our position and contend that we have already experienced other such ownership changes or that the sale of assets resulted in an ownership change 
in such case  our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income would be severely limited 
if the sale of assets to phc results in an ownership change as defined in section of the code  our tax loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income could be severely limited and the tax loss carryforwards may expire as a result of the limitation 
if an ownership change does not occur as a result of the sale to phc  there is still the potential for an ownership change to occur under section as a result of future changes in stock ownership 
net operating loss carryforwards may expire if we do not generate sufficient income to utilize the losses before their normal expiration 
generally  an ownership change occurs if one or more shareholders  each of whom owns or more in value of a corporation s stock  increase their aggregate percentage ownership by more than over the lowest percentage of stock owned by such shareholders at any time during the preceding three year period 
for example  if a single shareholder owning of our stock acquired an additional of our stock in a three year period  a change of ownership would occur 
similarly  if ten persons  none of whom owned our stock  each acquired slightly over of our stock within a three year period so that such persons own  in the aggregate  more than an ownership change would occur 
ownership of stock is determined by certain constructive ownership rules which can attribute ownership of stock owned by entities such as estates  trusts  corporations  and partnerships to the ultimate indirect owner 
for purposes of this rule  all holders who each own less than of a corporation s stock are generally treated together as one or  in certain cases  more than one shareholder 
transactions in the public markets among shareholders owning less than of the equity securities generally are not included in the calculation 
special rules can result in the treatment of options including warrants or other similar interests as having been exercised if such treatment would result in an ownership change 
as we explore whether there may be opportunities to utilize our tax loss carryforwards  due to the importance of avoiding a future ownership change under the tax laws  we will be limited in our ability to issue additional stock in the future to provide capital for our business 
we would only be able to issue such additional stock in a manner that would not cause an ownership change  for purposes of these rules  and thus our ability to access the equity markets could be restricted 
finally  in addition to section  certain other statutory provisions and common law doctrine could limit our opportunities to realize potential value from  or otherwise adversely affect our ability to preserve and utilize  our tax loss carryforwards 
the use of our tax loss carryforwards is subject to uncertainty because it is dependent upon the amount of taxable income we generate 
we have no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use the tax loss carryforwards before they expire 
we believe that our ability to achieve profitability may depend in substantial part on our ability to identify and acquire suitable acquisitions on favorable terms  so that we can increase our revenues and generate new income 
we may seek additional capital from time to time  including through the sale of stock or other securities  which may result in dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  as noted above  the provisions of the code and certain applicable irs regulations will limit the number of shares of stock we can sell from time to time without causing a limitation on our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax obligations 
liquidity and capital resources our operating expenditures have been significant since our inception 
we currently anticipate that our operating expenses in  although less than our operating expenses in  will significantly exceed net home and garden product sales and that net losses and working capital requirements will consume a material amount of our cash resources in as described above  our future capital requirements will depend on the success of our home and garden business and our ability to successfully implement our strategy of realizing potential value from our remaining business assets  primarily our tax loss carryforwards 
we have no current intention to make substantial investments to grow our home and garden business 
we believe that the balance of our cash and cash equivalents at december  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for net losses  working capital and capital expenditures for more than the next months  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled  an increase of  from the balance of  at december  in the first quarter of  we received  in net proceeds after transaction costs incurred after january  from the sale of the harpin protein technology to phc and on june  we collected  from phc as a partial payment of the promissory note 
we collected the remaining principal balance of  on december  prior to october  we financed our operations primarily through the private sale of our equity securities  resulting in net proceeds of million through september  in october  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock 
to a lesser extent  we have financed our equipment acquisitions through lease financings 
we plan to finance our operations in using existing cash and cash equivalents 
as discussed in detail above and in the section entitled risk factors risks related to our business plan to utilize tax loss carryforwards  our business strategy of exploring whether there may be opportunities to utilize our remaining business assets  including our tax loss carryforwards  will  due to the importance of avoiding a future ownership change under the tax laws  limit us in our ability to issue additional stock to provide capital for our business 
the sale of our harpin protein technology had the following effects on our cash used in operations and cash resources in cash and cash equivalents increased by  on february  this increase was offset by the payment of transaction costs totaling  incurred and recorded in the first three months of approximately  was incurred and recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in 
cash and cash equivalents also increased and other long term assets decreased by  for the release of restricted cash and return of deposit by the facility lease landlord 
on june   cash and cash equivalents increased and note receivable decreased by  as a result of collecting a portion of the note receivable from phc 
the remaining principal balance of  was collected on december  current inventory decreased by  for inventory sold to phc 
we also sold  of finished goods to phc under our independent distribution agreement with phc 
the remaining inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods used for our home and garden business 
other current assets decreased by  for equipment classified as held for sale and sold to phc 
property and equipment decreased by  for assets sold to phc 
current accrued liabilities decreased by  due to phc s assumption of these liabilities 
other long term liabilities decreased to zero at february  due to phc s assumption of our office and manufacturing facility lease liabilities recorded for rent expense in excess of rent payments totaling  and asset retirement obligation of  and our  liability to crf 
product sales  cost of goods sold  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses decreased significantly in compared to additionally  future minimum lease payments under the non cancelable office and manufacturing facility lease totaling  in   in and  in were assumed by phc as of february  we currently have no contractual obligations associated with capital and operating lease obligations 
net cash used in operations totaled  in  a decrease of  from  in  which decreased  from  in net cash used in operations of  in resulted primarily from net loss of  which includes loss on impairment of equipment  leasehold improvements and inventory  depreciation and amortization  deferred rent payable  gain on property and equipment  gain on sale of investment and stock compensation expense totaling  and fluctuations in various asset and liability balances totaling  net cash used in operations of  in resulted primarily from net loss of  which includes depreciation and amortization  loss on termination of lease and loss on property and equipment totaling  and fluctuations in various asset and liability balances totaling  we expect that cash used in operations in will continue to be significant 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled  in as a result of proceeds from the sale of our harpin protein technology and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled  in and  in and resulted primarily from proceeds from the sale of equipment  and in  the sale of an investment 
net cash provided by financing activities in totaled  and represents proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash used in financing activities totaled  in as a result of paying down the principal on capital leases  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
historically  we conducted our operations in three primary functional currencies the us dollar  the euro and  until december   the mexican peso 
historically  neither fluctuations in foreign exchange rates nor changes in foreign economic conditions have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we currently do not hedge our foreign currency exposures and are  therefore  subject to the risk of exchange rates 
we may invoice our international customers in us dollars or euros  as the case may be 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as of february   the cumulative translation adjustment related to our european subsidiary totaling  was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and reported as part of the gain on sale of harpin protein technology as this subsidiary was substantially liquidated as a result of the sale to phc 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on our financial results in  or employment agreement on july   we entered into an employment agreement with bradley s 
powell  our president and chief financial officer to help ensure the retention of his services during the critical period following the sale of our harpin protein technology 
under the terms of the employment agreement  we agreed to pay mr

critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our critical accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices  information provided by our customers and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include revenue recognition prior to the sale of our harpin protein technology assets on february   we sold the majority of our products to independent  third party distributors in the agricultural and horticultural markets 
our arrangements with those distributors provide no price protection or product return rights 
we recognize revenue from product sales  net of sales allowances  when product is delivered to our distributors and all of our significant obligations have been satisfied  unless acceptance provisions or other contingencies or arrangements exist  including whether collection is reasonably assured 
if acceptance provisions or contingencies exist  revenue is recognized after such provisions or contingencies have been satisfied 
as part of the analysis of whether all of our significant obligations have been satisfied or situations where acceptance provisions or other contingencies or arrangements exist  we consider the following elements  among others sales terms and arrangements  including customer payment terms  historical experience and current incentive programs 
sales allowances represent allowances granted to independent distributors for sales and marketing support and are based on the terms of the distribution agreements or other arrangements 
sales allowances are estimated and accrued when the related product sales are recognized or when services are provided and are paid in accordance with the terms of the then current distributor program agreements or other arrangements 
inventory valuation and classification our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market on an average cost basis 
we regularly review inventory balances to determine whether a write down is necessary 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions  general economic conditions  the age of our inventory and recent quality control data 
changes in the factors above or other factors could result in significant inventory cost reductions and write offs 
in reviewing for asset impairment in connection with the sale of our harpin protein technology to phc  we compared the carrying value at february  of assets sold to consideration received from phc and recorded liabilities assumed by phc 
based on this review  the carrying value of inventory sold to phc exceeded the consideration received from phc and recorded liabilities assumed by phc 
accordingly  we recorded a  charge for impairment to inventory as of december  we also review our inventory to determine inventory classification 
inventory expected to be utilized in the next twelve month period is classified as current and inventory expected to be utilized beyond that period is classified as non current 
in determining the classification of inventory  we consider a number of factors  including historical sales experience and trends  existing distributor inventory  expansion into new markets  introduction of new products and estimates of future sales growth 
valuation of property and equipment we periodically review the carrying values of our property and equipment to determine whether such assets have been impaired 
an impairment loss must be recorded pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the use of such assets are less than their carrying value 
the determination of undiscounted net cash flows expected requires us to make many estimates  projections and assumptions  including the lives of the assets  future sales and expense levels  additional capital investments or expenditures necessary to maintain the assets  industry market trends and general and industry economic conditions 
prior to the sale of our harpin protein technology assets on february   our property and equipment consisted primarily of assets used to manufacture and sell our products and assets used in our research and administration 
for the purpose of assessing asset impairment  we have grouped all of these assets together in one asset group because our administration and research support our manufacturing and sales activities and do not have a separate identifiable cash flow 
we continued to incur losses from operations and actual sales and growth rates for the first half of were significantly lower than expected 
in reviewing for impairment in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended june   we compared the carrying value of such assets to updated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset group 
as a result of continuing operating losses and lower sales and growth rates in the first half of compared to forecasts  the carrying value of the group of assets exceeded undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of this asset group 
consequently  we concluded on july  that a charge for impairment to our equipment and leasehold improvements was required and a  impairment loss was recognized at june  we estimated the fair value of equipment using an orderly liquidation method and leasehold improvements were estimated to have zero fair value 
in december  we completed an efficiency analysis of our manufacturing processes  including an assessment of all manufacturing equipment and its usefulness in future manufacturing operations 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a loss of  on equipment that we determined would not be used in future manufacturing operations and would be sold or disposed 
the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell equipment to be sold totaled  at december  and was included in other current assets on the balance sheet 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning with fiscal year the impact of adopting sfas no 
is not expected to be significant to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
 which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
is not expected to be significant to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently hold any derivative instruments and we do not engage in hedging activities 
also  we do not have any outstanding variable interest rate debt and currently do not enter into any material transactions denominated in foreign currency 
because of the relatively short term average maturity of our investment funds  such investments are sensitive to interest rate movements 
therefore  our future interest income may be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from our cash equivalents is not material
