item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
business overview we generate our revenues primarily from sales of admission to our parks  food  merchandise and games inside our parks  and hotel rooms  food and other attractions outside our parks 
our principal costs and expenses  which include salaries and wages  advertising  maintenance  operating supplies  utilities and insurance  are relatively fixed and do not vary significantly with attendance 
in order to efficiently manage our properties since the ppi acquisition in  we created regional designations for our parks 
the northern region  which is the largest  includes cedar point and the adjacent soak city water park  kings island  canada s wonderland  dorney park  valleyfair  geauga lake and michigan s adventure 
the southern region includes kings dominion  carowinds  worlds of fun and oceans of fun 
finally  our western region includes knott s berry farm  great america and the soak city water parks located in palm springs  san diego and adjacent to knott s berry farm 
this region also includes star trek the experience  an interactive adventure in las vegas and the management contract with gilroy gardens family theme park in gilroy  california

for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda  including a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to operating income the most comparable financial measure  see note in item  selected financial data  on page critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions during the normal course of business that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results or involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity see note to our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
application of the critical accounting policies described below involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates and assumptions  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to similar businesses 
accounting for business combinations business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by management  taking into consideration information obtained during the due diligence process  valuations supplied by independent appraisal experts and other relevant information 
the valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value 
the determination of fair values requires significant judgment both by management and outside experts engaged to assist in this process 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
expenditures made to maintain such assets in their original operating condition are expensed as incurred  and improvements and upgrades are capitalized 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the composite method is used for the group of assets acquired as a whole in  as well as for the groups of like assets of each subsequent business acquisition 
the unit method is used for all individual assets purchased 
impairment of long lived assets the carrying values of long lived assets  including property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  including disposition  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
the measurement of the impairment loss to be recognized is based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying amounts of the assets 
fair value is generally determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
in order to determine if an asset has been impaired  assets are grouped and tested at the lowest level for which identifiable  independent cash flows are available 
the determination of both undiscounted and discounted cash flows requires management to make significant estimates and consider an anticipated course of action as of the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated actions could impact the determination of whether impairment exists  the amount of the impairment charge recorded and whether the effects could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
self insurance reserves reserves are recorded for the estimated amounts of guest and employee claims and expenses incurred each period that are not covered by insurance 
these estimates are established based upon historical claims data and third party estimates of settlement costs for incurred claims 
these reserves are periodically reviewed for changes in these factors and adjustments are made as needed 
revenue recognition revenues on multi day admission tickets are recognized over the estimated number of visits expected for each type of ticket  and are adjusted at the end of each seasonal period 
all other revenues are recognized on a daily basis based on actual guest spending at our facilities  or over the park operating season in the case of certain marina dockage revenues and certain sponsorship revenues 
derivative financial instruments derivative financial instruments are only used within our overall risk management program to manage certain interest rate and foreign currency risks from time to time 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the use of derivative financial instruments is accounted for according to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and related amendments 
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
derivative financial instruments used in hedging transactions are assessed both at inception and quarterly thereafter to ensure they are effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the related underlying exposures 
results of operations vs 
our results are not directly comparable to the prior year due to the acquisition of ppi on june  since material changes to our statements of operations are primarily due to this acquisition  we will also discuss operating results for on a same park basis compared to the following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended december  and all properties a same park comparison b increase decrease amounts in thousands except per capita spending attendance per capita spending out of park revenues net revenues cash operating costs and expenses adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization equity based compensation impairment loss on fixed assets operating income a includes results for all owned and or managed properties as of december  b same park comparison includes properties owned and operated for the full periods in and and excludes the newly acquired parks and corporate costs 
for same park comparisons in previous filings  corporate costs were included as a reduction of operating income 
for the current and future filings  comparisons will be made on a park level basis and will exclude all corporate costs 
same park comparison consolidated net revenues in on a same park basis increased to million from million in the increase in net revenues was the result of a increase in average in park guest per capita spending and a increase in out of park revenues  partially offset by a decline in combined attendance 
average per capita spending and out of park revenues  including hotels  increased steadily across all regions during the year 
the northern region produced increases in average per capita spending and out of park revenues  in large part due to the introduction of world class roller coasters at both cedar point and valleyfair 
this more than offset a slight decrease in attendance in the region 
excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  total cash operating costs and expenses  on a same park basis  decreased slightly to million from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced cash operating costs at geauga lake in as a result of the restructuring  offset somewhat by higher operating costs at knott s berry farm 
on september  we announced plans to operate geauga lake exclusively as a water park beginning in after four years of operation  we determined that the market demand was not sufficient to support the park as it was structured 
we plan to market the excess property and have identified assets to be relocated to other locations and to be sold and or disposed 
in connection with this restructuring  we incurred losses associated with non cash charges for impairment of fixed assets totaling million for the year 
although this restructuring was done to ultimately improve ebitda at this location  the impact of this decision on future levels of revenues and adjusted ebitda will not be material 
further discussion of this transaction can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the period  depreciation and amortization expense on a same park basis increased million  or  due primarily to the accelerated depreciation on certain geauga lake assets in after higher depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  operating income for the year on a same park basis decreased to million from million a year ago 
because we strongly emphasize generating cash flow for distributions to our unitholders  a meaningful measure of our operating results is adjusted ebitda  which represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and other non cash charges and credits for additional information regarding adjusted ebitda and a reconciliation to net income  see note in item  selected financial data  on page 
in  adjusted ebitda on a same park basis increased  or million  to million  due primarily to strong increases in operating profits at most of our northern region parks  including cedar point  dorney park and valleyfair 
additionally  this increase in operating profits includes the settlement of a management contract dispute of approximately million 
based on these results  our consolidated adjusted ebitda margin on a same park basis increased to in from in all properties on a combined basis  including the newly acquired parks  consolidated net revenues totaled million in compared to million in excluding depreciation and other non cash charges  combined operating costs and expenses were million versus million a year ago 
in  combined adjusted ebitda increased million to million  while our adjusted ebitda margin decreased to from in the decrease in margin in was primarily due to the timing of the acquisition in june  when combined results for the full year benefited from operating the new parks only during their peak months and avoided the operating costs of the first six months of the year 
included in the increase in adjusted ebitda of million was the settlement of a management contract dispute of approximately million 
after depreciation  amortization and the million impairment loss from the geauga lake restructuring  operating income for the year  on a combined basis  was million compared with million in interest expense and other expense  net  for the year increased million to million  primarily due to a full year of interest expense on the acquisition financing compared to only six months in a provision for taxes of million was recorded to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries million and publicly traded partnership ptp taxes million 
this compares with a provision for taxes of for after interest expense and provision for taxes  combined net loss for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with net income of million  or per unit  a year ago 
vs 
our results for are not directly comparable to the prior year due to the acquisition of ppi on june  since material changes to our statements of operations are primarily due to this acquisition  we will also discuss operating results for on a same park basis compared to the following table presents key operating and financial information for the years ended december  and all properties a same park comparison b increase decrease amounts in thousands except per capita spending attendance per capita spending out of park revenues net revenues cash operating costs and expenses adjusted ebitda depreciation and amortization equity based compensation operating income a includes results for all owned and or managed properties as of december  b same park comparison includes properties owned and operated for the full periods in and and excludes the newly acquired parks and corporate costs 
for same park comparisons in previous filings  corporate costs were included as a reduction of operating income 
for the current and future filings  comparisons will be made on a park level basis and will exclude all corporate costs 
same park comparison consolidated net revenues in on a same park basis decreased slightly to million from million in the decrease in net revenues was the result of a decrease in combined attendance  a increase in out of park revenues and average guest per capita spending which increased slightly 
the small decrease in attendance and revenues is primarily due to performance at several of our northern region parks 
the region was impacted by a continued soft economy coupled with higher gas prices throughout the operating season 
these soft spots were partially offset by increased attendance and per capita spending at other parks within the region 
the southern region  which benefited from a world class roller coaster introduced at worlds of fun  produced attendance and revenues increases of more than  while the western region parks increased their in park and out of park revenues on relatively steady attendance 
excluding depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges  total cash operating costs and expenses  on a same park basis  decreased slightly to million from million in the decrease was attributable to lower operating costs at our northern region parks  offset slightly by higher operating costs in our southern region due in part to higher attendance 
after higher depreciation  offset by lower non cash charge for unit options  operating income for on a same park basis decreased to million from million a year ago 
in  adjusted ebitda on a same park basis increased one percent  or million  to million  in part due to slightly improved results at several of our northern region parks  our southern region parks  where a new world class roller coaster was introduced at worlds of fun  and our western parks  where in park and out of park spending increased year over year 
these improved results were slightly offset by decreases in operating profits from some of our northern region parks 
based on these results  our consolidated adjusted ebitda margin in on a same park basis increased to from in all properties on a combined basis  including the newly acquired parks  consolidated net revenues for were million 
excluding depreciation and other non cash charges  combined operating costs and expenses were million 
after depreciation  amortization and a small non cash charge for unit options  operating income for was million compared with million in interest expense for the year increased million to million  due to the acquisition financing and refinancing of existing debt 
as part of the refinancing of existing debt  we recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of million 
a provision for taxes of million was recorded to account for the tax attributes of our corporate subsidiaries million and publicly traded partnership ptp taxes million 
this compares with a benefit for taxes of for  when we reversed million of contingent liabilities related to ptp taxes 
after interest expense and provision for taxes  combined net income for the period totaled million  or per diluted limited partner unit  compared with net income of million  or per unit  a year ago 
financial condition we ended in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow 
the negative working capital ratio current liabilities divided by current assets of at december  is the result of our highly seasonal business 
receivables and inventories are at normally low seasonal levels and credit facilities are in place to fund current liabilities  capital expenditures and pre opening expenses as required 
operating activities net cash from operating activities in increased million to million compared with million in the increase in operating cash flows between years is primarily attributable to the improved operating results of our legacy parks  largely offset by higher cash interest payments 
net cash from operating activities in increased million to million compared with million in the increase in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to the operation of the newly acquired parks  substantially offset by higher cash interest payments 
investing activities investing activities consist principally of acquisitions and capital investments we make in our parks and resort properties 
during  cash used for investing activities totaled million  compared to  million in and million in the significant increase in cash for investing activities in was attributable to the acquisition of ppi 
historically  we have been able to improve our revenues and profitability by continuing to make substantial investments in our park and resort facilities 
this has enabled us to maintain or increase attendance levels  as well as generate increases in guest per capita spending and revenues from guest accommodations  while carefully controlling operating and administrative expenses 
for the operating season  we are investing million in capital improvements at our properties  including the addition of world class roller coasters at canada s wonderland  kings dominion  dorney park  knott s berry farm  and michigan s adventure 
the program will also include the introduction of new water attractions at carowinds and a new spinning ride at great america 
in addition to adding great new thrill rides  we are also investing in other capital improvements across our parks  including additional rides and attractions  restaurant renovations  new games and other general improvements 
we believe the combination of a strong capital program  our second full year of operating the newly acquired parks  and our continued focus on guest service  will improve attendance  guest per capita spending and operating results company wide in however  stable population trends in the parks market areas and uncontrollable factors  such as weather  the economy  and competition for leisure time and spending  preclude us from anticipating significant long term increases in attendance 
financing activities net cash utilized for financing activities totaled million in  compared to net cash from financing activities of  million in and net cash utilized for financing activities of million in the significant increase in cash from financing activities in was attributable to higher borrowings to fund the ppi acquisition 
capital resources in june  and as amended in august  in connection with the acquisition of ppi we entered into a new  million credit agreement with several banks and certain lenders party thereto the credit agreement 
in february  we took advantage of favorable market conditions and amended the credit agreement the amended agreement  reducing interest rate spreads on the term borrowings by basis points bps 
the credit facilities provided under the february  amended and restated credit agreement include a  million us term loan  million in us revolving loan commitments  a million canadian term loan and million in canadian revolving loan commitments 
under the amended agreement  us denominated loans made under the us and canadian revolving loan commitments currently bear interest at a rate based on libor plus bps 
canadian denominated loans made under the canadian revolving commitments currently bear interest at a rate based on bankers acceptance plus bps or canadian prime plus bps 
all term debt currently bears interest at either a rate based on libor plus bps or a rate based on a prime rate plus bps 
the us term loan matures on august  and amortizes at a rate of million per year 
the canadian term loan matures on february  and amortizes at a rate of million per year 
the us revolving commitment and the canadian revolving commitment expire on august  the credit agreement also provides for the issuance of documentary and standby letters of credit 
at december   we had  million of variable rate term debt and million in borrowings under the revolving credit facilities 
after letters of credit  which totaled million at december   we had million of available borrowings under our revolving credit agreements 
during  we entered into several interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted billion of our us variable rate debt to a fixed rate of  after taking into account the february amendment to the credit agreement 
in january  we entered into several additional interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert another million of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate of 
during we also entered into two cross currency swap agreements to manage our foreign currency risk exposure on term debt borrowings related to our wholly owned canadian subsidiary 
in february  we terminated the two cross currency swaps and received million in cash upon termination 
we replaced these swaps with two new cross currency swap agreements  which effectively converted million of term debt  and the associated interest payments  from us dollar denominated debt at a rate of libor plus bps to fixed rate canadian dollar denominated debt 
of the total term debt  million is scheduled to mature in based on interest rates in effect at year end for variable rate debt  we expect our aggregate average cost of debt to be in the to range for and cash interest payments for would total approximately million versus actual interest paid of million in in addition  cash distributions in  at the current rate of per unit  would total approximately million  higher than the distributions paid in credit facilities and cash flow from operations are expected to be adequate to meet working capital needs  debt service  planned capital expenditures and regular quarterly cash distributions for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes certain obligations on an undiscounted basis at december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital expenditures lease other obligations total represents maturities on long term debt obligations  plus contractual interest payments on all debt 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
represents contractual obligations in place at year end for the purchase of new rides and attractions 
obligations not denominated in us dollars have been converted based on the exchange rates existing on december  represents contractual lease and purchase obligations in place at year end 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet financing arrangements 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  and to a lesser extent on currency exchange rates on our operations in canada and  from time to time  on imported rides and equipment 
the objective of our financial risk management is to reduce the potential negative impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to acceptable levels 
we do not acquire market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of interest rate swaps  which fix a portion of our variable rate long term debt  and variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit loans 
we mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exposure from the canadian dollar through the use of foreign currency denominated debt 
hedging of the us dollar denominated debt  used to fund a substantial portion of our net investment in our canadian operations  is accomplished through the use of cross currency swaps 
any gain or loss on the hedging instrument offsets the gain or loss on the underlying debt 
translation exposures with regard to our canadian operations are not hedged 
after considering the impact of interest rate swap agreements  at december    million of our outstanding long term debt represented fixed rate debt and million represented variable rate debt 
in january of we hedged an additional million of our long term debt through the use of several new interest rate swaps agreements 
further discussion on these swaps can be found in note in item assuming an average balance on our revolving credit borrowings  the cash flow impact of a hypothetical one percentage point change in the applicable interest rates on our variable rate debt  after the january rate swap agreements  would be approximately million as of december  a uniform strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a  decrease in annual operating income 
impact of inflation substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent such increases could possibly not be passed along to our guests 
in particular  increases in labor  supplies  taxes and utility expenses could have an impact on our operating results 
the majority of our employees are seasonal and are paid hourly rates  which although not tied directly to federal and state minimum wage laws  do follow those wage trends 
historically  we have been able to pass along cost increases to guests through increases in admission  food  merchandise and other prices  and we believe that we will continue to have the ability to do so over the long term 
we believe that the effects of inflation  if any  on our operating results and financial condition have been and will continue to be minor
