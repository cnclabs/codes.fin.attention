the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the leading independent provider of enterprise data integration software 
we generate revenues from sales of software licenses for our enterprise data integration software products and from sales of services  which consist of maintenance  consulting  and education services 
we receive revenues from licensing our products under perpetual licenses directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors  and oems in the united states and internationally 
we also receive a small amount of revenues under subscription based licenses for on demand offerings from customers and partners 
our software license revenues also include software upgrades  which are not part of post contract services 
most of our international sales have been in europe  and revenue outside of europe and north america has comprised or less of total consolidated revenues during the last three 
table of contents years 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services  and education services that we perform for customers that license our products either directly or indirectly 
we license our software and provide services to many industry sectors  including  but not limited to  energy and utilities  financial services  insurance  government and public sector  healthcare  high technology  manufacturing  retail  services  telecommunications  and transportation in  our total revenues grew to million and we generated net income of million  or per diluted share 
the increase in license revenues was a result primarily of an increase in the average size of our transactions and  to a lesser extent  an increase in volume of transactions and an increase in international license revenues 
the increase in service revenues was primarily from increased maintenance revenues driven by our expanding customer base 
on january   we acquired similarity systems limited similarity  a provider of a software product suite that includes data profiling  data standardization  data cleansing  data matching  and data quality monitoring 
we have extended our enterprise data integration platform by working to incorporate certain components of similarity s product suite  including its patented data quality technology 
on march   we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due in notes 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the purchase of shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the notes  and we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or additional purchases of common stock 
on december   we acquired itemfield  inc itemfield 
itemfield s data transformation technologies enable near universal access to unstructured and semi structured data 
incorporation of this technology extends our data integration platform to allow customers to integrate these data sources with traditional structured data sources 
due to our dynamic market  we face both significant opportunities and challenges  and as such  we focus on the following key factors competition inherent in our industry are risks arising from competition with existing software solutions  including solutions from ibm  oracle  and sap  technological advances from other vendors  and the perception of cost savings by solving data integration challenges through customer hand coded development resources 
our prospective customers may view these alternative solutions as more attractive than our offerings 
additionally  the consolidation activity in our industry including business objects acquisition of firstlogic  oracle s acquisition of sunopsis and hyperion solutions  ibm s acquisition of datamirror and cognos  sap s acquisition of business objects  and oracle s agreement to acquire bea systems could pose challenges as competitors market a broader suite of software products or solutions to our prospective customers 
new product introductions to address the expanding data integration and data integrity needs of our customers and prospective customers  we continue to introduce new products and technology enhancements on a regular basis 
for example  in march  we launched informatica on demand data replicator  a multi tenant  on demand service for cross enterprise data integration 
in september  we announced a new informatica on demand service informatica data quality assessment for salesforce 
com which uses pre defined rules to identify missing  invalid  and duplicate data 
in october  we delivered the generally available release of powercenter  powerexchange  and informatica data quality  a version upgrade to our entire data integration platform 
new product introductions and or enhancements have inherent risks including  but not limited to  product availability  product quality and interoperability  and customer adoption or the delay in customer purchases 
given the risks and new nature of the products  we cannot predict their impact on our overall sales and revenues 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations historically  purchasing patterns in the software industry have followed quarterly and seasonal trends and are likely to do so in the future 
specifically  it is normal for us to recognize a substantial portion of our new license orders in the last month of each quarter and sometimes in the last few weeks of each quarter  though such fluctuations are mitigated somewhat by recognition of backlog orders 
in recent years  the fourth quarter has had the highest level of license revenue and order backlog  and we have generally had weaker demand for our software products and services in the first and third quarters 

table of contents to address these potential risks  we have focused on a number of key initiatives  including the strengthening of our partnerships  the broadening of our distribution capability worldwide  and the targeting of our sales force and distribution channel on new products 
in april  we established business units for three key solutions data integration  data quality  and on demand 
this initiative closely aligns our marketing resources with product development 
we are concentrating on maintaining and strengthening our relationships with our existing strategic partners and building relationships with additional strategic partners 
these partners include systems integrators  resellers and distributors  and strategic technology partners  including enterprise application providers  database vendors  and enterprise information integration vendors  in the united states and internationally 
in  we signed oem agreements with cognos acquired by ibm  fast which recently received an acquisition offer from microsoft  sap and other vendors 
these are in addition to our global oem partnerships with oracle hyperion solutions and siebel  and our partnership with salesforce 
com 
see risk factors we rely on our relationships with our strategic partners 
if we do not maintain and strengthen these relationships  our ability to generate revenue and control expenses could be adversely affected  which could cause a decline in the price of our common stock in part i  item a 
we have also broadened our distribution efforts 
in  we continued to expand our sales both in terms of selling data warehouse products to the enterprise level and of selling more strategic data integration solutions beyond data warehousing  including data quality  data migrations  data consolidations  data synchronizations  data hubs  and cross enterprise data integration to our customers enterprise architects and chief information officers 
we have also expanded our international sales presence by opening new offices and increasing headcount 
this included opening sales offices in brazil  china  india  italy  japan  mexico  south korea  and taiwan in   and we also established training partnerships in late in india  latin america  and the united states to provide hands on product training for customers and partners 
as a result of this international expansion  as well as the increase in our direct sales headcount in the united states  our sales and marketing expenses have increased accordingly during   and we expect these investments to result in increased revenues and productivity and ultimately higher profitability 
however  if we experience an increase in sales personnel turnover  do not achieve expected increases in our sales pipeline  experience a decline in our sales pipeline conversion ratio  or do not achieve increases in sales productivity and efficiencies from our new sales personnel as they gain more experience  then it is unlikely that we will achieve our expected increases in revenue  sales productivity  or profitability 
we have experienced some increases in revenues and sales productivity in the united states in the past few years 
during the past year  we have experienced increases in revenues and sales productivity internationally  but we have not yet achieved the same level of sales productivity internationally as domestically 
to address the risks of introducing new products  we have continued to invest in programs to help train our internal sales force and our external distribution channel on new product functionalities  key differentiations  and key business values 
these programs include informatica world for customers and partners  our annual sales kickoff conference for all sales and key marketing personnel in january  webinars for our direct sales force and indirect distribution channel  in person technical seminars for our pre sales consultants  the building of product demonstrations  and creation and distribution of targeted marketing collateral 
we have also invested in partner enablement programs  including product specific briefings to partners and the inclusion of several partners in our beta programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments  and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments  and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments  and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments  and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  facilities restructuring charges  income taxes  impairment of goodwill  acquisitions  and share based payments have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
we discuss below the critical accounting estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments  and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see the discussion in note summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 

table of contents revenue recognition we follow detailed revenue recognition guidelines  which are discussed below 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states that have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules  which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments  such as determining if collectibility is probable 
we derive revenues from software license fees  maintenance fees which entitle the customer to receive product support and unspecified software updates  and professional services  consisting of consulting and education services 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
the basis for recognizing software license revenue is determined by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  together with other authoritative literature the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab sab  revenue recognition  and other authoritative literature  see the subsection revenue recognition in note summary of significant accounting policies  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
substantially all of our software licenses are perpetual licenses under which the customer acquires the perpetual right to use the software as provided and subject to the conditions of the license agreement 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of software  maintenance  and professional services revenue to be recognized each period 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer contracts and exercise judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
we consider factors including extended payment terms  financing arrangements  the category of customer end user customer or reseller  rights of return or refund  and our history of enforcing the terms and conditions of customer contracts 
if the fee due from a customer is not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized when payment becomes due or upon cash receipt  whichever is earlier 
if we determine that a fee due from a reseller is not fixed or determinable upon shipment to the reseller  we do not recognize the revenue until the reseller provides us with evidence of sell through to an end user customer and or upon cash receipt 
further  we make judgment in determining the collectibility of the amounts due from our customers that could possibly impact the timing of revenue recognition 
we assess credit worthiness and collectibility  and  when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
our software license arrangements include the following multiple elements license fees from our core software products and or product upgrades that are not part of post contract services  maintenance fees  consulting  and or education services 
we use the residual method to recognize license revenue upon delivery when the arrangement includes elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vsoe is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered software product element of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered  or vsoe is established 
if vsoe does not exist for any undelivered services elements of the arrangement  all revenue is recognized ratably over the period that the services are expected to be performed 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining if vsoe exists for each undelivered element 
consulting services  if included as part of the software arrangement  generally do not require significant modification or customization of the software 
if  in our judgment  the software arrangement includes significant modification or customization of the software  then software license revenue is recognized as the consulting services revenue is recognized 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services and product configurations 
these services are performed on a time and materials basis and  occasionally  on a fixed fee basis 
revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed 
if uncertainty exists about our ability to complete the project  our ability to collect the amounts due  or in the case of fixed fee consulting arrangements  our ability to estimate the remaining costs to be incurred to complete the project  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
multiple contracts with a single counterparty executed within close proximity of each other are evaluated to determine if the contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single arrangement 
we recognize revenues net of applicable sales taxes  financing charges absorbed by informatica  and amounts retained by our resellers and distributors  if any 
our agreements do not permit for returns  and historically we have not had any significant returns or refunds  therefore  we have not established a sales return reserve at this time 

table of contents facilities restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded significant charges restructuring plan related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters to take advantage of more favorable lease terms and reduced operating expenses 
in addition  we significantly increased the restructuring charges restructuring plan in the third and fourth quarters of due to changes in our assumptions used to calculate the original charges as a result of our decision to relocate our corporate headquarters 
the accrued restructuring charges represent gross lease obligations and estimated commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by actual and estimated gross sublease income  which is net of estimated broker commissions and tenant improvement allowances  expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
inherent in the assessment of the costs related to our restructuring efforts are estimates related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions periodically to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
currently  we have subleased our excess facilities in connection with our and facilities restructuring but for durations that are generally less than the remaining lease terms 
if we determine that there is a change in the estimated sublease rates or in the expected time it will take us to sublease our vacant space  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future and our cash position could be adversely affected 
see note facilities restructuring charges  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
future adjustments to the charges could result from a change in the time period that the buildings will be vacant  expected sublease rates  expected sublease terms  and the expected time it will take to sublease 
we will periodically assess the need to update the original restructuring charges based on current real estate market information  trend analysis  and executed sublease agreements 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainties in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin to account for any income tax contingencies 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realizable and to the extent we believe that realizability is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our historical levels of income  expectations of future taxable income  and ongoing tax planning strategies 
we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of our analysis of all available evidence at september  and december   it was considered more likely than not that our non stock option related deferred tax assets would be realized 
the release of the remaining valuation allowance resulted in a million tax benefit recorded to the income statement and a million benefit recorded to goodwill 
the remaining deferred tax assets subject to valuation allowance are related to stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be 
table of contents recorded in stockholders equity when realized 
these deferred tax assets will not provide a reduction in the company s effective tax rate 
as of december   we believed that the amount of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet as a result of the release of valuation allowance during the fiscal year would ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets 
accounting for impairment of goodwill we assess goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas no 
consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit 
goodwill was tested for impairment in our annual impairment tests on october in each of the years   and using the two step process required by sfas no 
first  we reviewed the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock 
if such comparison reflected potential impairment  we would then prepare the discounted cash flow analyses 
such analyses are based on cash flow assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the business 
an excess carrying value compared to fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
finally  if we determined that goodwill may be impaired  then we would compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas no 
 to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
based on these estimates  we determined in our annual impairment tests as of october of each year that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount and  accordingly  goodwill was not impaired 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including such external factors as industry and economic trends and such internal factors as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
acquisitions we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as purchased in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
share based payments we account for share based payments related to share based transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over its requisite service period 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected life 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our current estimate of volatility was based upon a blend of average historical and market based implied volatilities of our stock price that we have used consistently since the adoption of sfas no 
r 
our 
table of contents historical volatility rates decreased in from and primarily due to more stable stock prices in recent quarters and exclusion of more volatile years from the calculation of our historical volatility rates 
our implied volatility rates remained relatively unchanged 
our volatility rates were at in down from in to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing share based payments in future periods 
for instance  an estimate in volatility percentage points higher would have resulted in a million increase in the fair value of options granted during the year ended december  our expected life of options granted was derived from the historical option exercises  post vesting cancellations  and estimates concerning future exercises and cancellations for vested and unvested options that remain outstanding 
we lowered our expected life estimate from years in to years in the first quarter of 
a reduction in the expected life from years to years reduces the expense by approximately through the life of the options 
the lower expected life of options was mainly due to a reduction in contractual term of our grants from years to years in april  and also higher exercise volume due to higher stock prices in recent quarters 
we assumed expected life of years in valuing the option grants made throughout and anticipate to continue using the same expected life throughout in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate in determining the grant date fair value of our option grants 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate was based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future  our share based payments could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
during the year ended december   we lowered our forfeiture rate from to primarily due to recent changes in historical employee turnover rates 
as a result of this change  our share based payments expense increased by approximately million for the year ended december  we believe that the estimates that we have used for the calculation of the variables to arrive at share based payments are accurate 
we will  however  continue to monitor the historical performance of these variables and will modify our methodology and assumptions in the future as needed

the increase in license revenues in from was primarily due to an increase in the average size of our transactions and to a lesser extent was due to an increase in volume of transactions and an increase in international license revenues 
we have two types of upgrades upgrades that are not part of the post contract services for which we charge customers an additional fee  and upgrades that are part of the post contract services that we provide to our customers at no additional charge 
the average transaction amount for orders greater than  in  including upgrades  increased to  from  and  in and  respectively 
the number of transactions greater than million increased to in from in and in we believe that the increase in average transaction amount is primarily the result of larger deployments by customers and continued growth in the broader data integration market

consulting and education services revenues consulting and education services revenues were million or of total revenues in  million or of total revenues in  and million or of total revenues in the million or increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in demand for consulting and education services in europe and north america 
the million or increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in demand and an increase in capacity to meet the demand for consulting services in north america  europe  and latin america 
for  we expect to maintain our current utilization rates and continue to add overall consulting capacity  and thus we expect revenues from consulting and education services to increase from the levels 
international revenues our international revenues were million or of total revenues in  million or of total revenues in  and million or of total revenues in  representing an increase of million or in from  and an increase of million or in from the million or increase in from and the million or increase in from in international revenues was primarily due to our continued expansion in europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
for  we expect international revenues as a percentage of total revenues to be relatively consistent with  or increase slightly from the levels 
future revenues new orders  backlog  and deferred revenue our future revenues include backlog consisting primarily of product license orders that have not shipped as of the end of a given quarter  orders received from certain distributors  resellers  and oems  not included in deferred revenues  where revenue is recognized based on cash receipt collectively and are aggregate backlog  and deferred revenues 
our deferred revenues are primarily comprised of maintenance revenues that we recognize over the term of the contract  typically one year  license product orders that have shipped but where the terms of the license agreement contain acceptance language or other terms that require that the license revenues be deferred until all revenue recognition criteria are met or recognized ratably over an extended period  and consulting and education services revenues that have been prepaid but for which services have not yet been performed 
we typically ship products shortly after the receipt of an order  which is 
table of contents common in the software industry  and historically our backlog of license orders awaiting shipment at the end of any given quarter has varied 
however  our backlog typically decreases from the prior quarter at the end of the first and third quarters and increases at the end of the fourth quarter 
aggregate backlog and deferred revenues at december  were approximately million compared to million at december  this increase in was primarily due to an increase in deferred license and maintenance revenues

amortization of acquired technology amortization of acquired technology is the amortization of technologies acquired through business combinations 
amortization of acquired technology totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 

table of contents the million or increase in from was primarily due to certain developed technology that we acquired in december in connection with the itemfield acquisition 
the million or increase in from was primarily due to certain developed technology that we acquired in january in connection with the similarity acquisition 
for  we expect amortization of acquired technology to be approximately million including the amortization resulting from the similarity and itemfield acquisitions 
we may incur additional amortization expense beyond these expected future levels if we make additional acquisitions 
operating expenses research and development percentage change years ended december  to to in thousands  except percentages research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  consulting services  facilities  and related overhead costs associated with the development of new products  enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance  and development of documentation for our products

the million or increase in from was primarily due to an million increase in personnel related cost including travel related and equipment related expense  as a result of headcount increasing from in to in also contributing to this increase was a million increase in consulting and temporary outside services 
the million or increase in from was primarily due to a million increase in personnel related cost including travel related and equipment related expense  as a result of headcount increasing from in to in most of the headcount increase was related to the acquisitions of similarity and itemfield 
also contributing to this increase was an increase of million in legal expenses related to the business objects lawsuit  a million increase in stock based compensation  and a million increase in consulting services 
to date  all software and development costs have been expensed because they were incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility 
as a percentage of total revenues  we expect the research and development expenses in remain relatively consistent or decrease slightly compared with levels

for  we expect the sales and marketing expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  to remain relatively consistent with or decrease slightly from levels 
we also expect the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses to fluctuate from period to period due to the timing 
table of contents of hiring new sales and marketing personnel  our spending on marketing programs  and the level of the commission expenditures  in each period

the increase in personnel related costs of million was primarily due to headcount growth from in to in general and administrative expenses increased by million or in from the most significant factor driving this increase was stock based compensation  which increased by million over personnel related costs  including salaries and wages  travel related and equipment related expenses  and telecommunication expenses increased by million due to headcount increases from in to in outside services  which consists of legal  accounting  and tax services  increased by million in over the increase in personnel related costs and outside services continues to be driven by compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley

the ipr d charges were associated with software development efforts in process at the time of the acquisition that had not yet achieved technological feasibility  and no future alternative uses had been identified 
we did not incur any ipr d charges in relation to the itemfield acquisition 
we may further incur ipr d expense in the future to the extent we make additional acquisitions

net cash payments for facilities included in the restructuring plan amounted to million in  million in  and million in actual future cash requirements may differ from the restructuring liability balances as of december  if we are unable to continue subleasing the excess leased facilities  there are changes to the time period that facilities are vacant  or the actual sublease income is different from current estimates 
our results of operations has been positively affected since by a significant decrease in rent expense and decreases to non cash depreciation and amortization expense for the leasehold improvements and equipment written off 
these combined savings were approximately to million annually compared to  after accretion charges  and we anticipate that they will continue in and in addition  we will continue to evaluate our current facilities requirements to identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
we will also evaluate the assumptions related to estimated future sublease income for excess facilities 
accordingly  any changes to these estimates of excess facilities costs could result in additional charges that could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations

on a going forward basis  we expect our effective tax rate to be closer to the statutory rate of less the benefit attributable to foreign income taxed at lower rates and tax credits generated during the year 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and public offerings of our common stock 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million of restricted cash under the terms of our pacific shores property leases and million restricted cash under the terms of our australia lease 
in january  pursuant to a purchase agreement  similarity stockholders received approximately million in cash and approximately  shares of informatica common stock which were fully vested but subject to escrow valued on the date of close at approximately million 
in addition  the options of similarity option holders were assumed by informatica and converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of informatica common stock valued on the date of close at approximately million 
in december  pursuant to a merger agreement  itemfield stockholders  non employee option holders  and certain employees are entitled to receive approximately million in cash subject to our escrow agreement for million and the outstanding options held by itemfield employees were converted into approximately  shares of informatica stock options with a fair value of million  of which the company paid million in december our primary sources of cash are the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
our uses of cash include payroll and payroll related expenses and operating expenses such as marketing programs  travel  professional services  and facilities and related costs 
we have also used cash to purchase property and equipment  repurchase common stock from the open market to reduce the dilutive impact of stock option issuances  and acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings

our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable decreased from days at december  to days at december  deferred revenues increased primarily due to increased customer support contracts and an increase in deferred license revenues 
days outstanding at december  were primarily impacted by improvements to our collection program 
investing activities we anticipate that we will continue to purchase necessary property and equipment in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods depend on a number of factors  including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business  and our business outlook 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investment objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive  or we are in need of cash 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity  or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings  and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
financing activities we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million due to the issuance of common stock to option holders and to participants of our espp program for million  and million of excess tax benefits from share based payments  which were partially offset by a million repurchase and retirement of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million including issuance of convertible debt for million and issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp for million which were partially offset by a million repurchase and retirement of common stock and a million payment of debt issuance costs 
net cash used in financing activities in was million due to the repurchases and retirement of common stock for million  offset by a million issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp 
although we expect to continue to receive some proceeds from the issuance of common stock to option holders and participants of espp in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors  including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan  and general market conditions 
in march  we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due in notes 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from the offering to fund the purchase of  shares of our common stock concurrently with the offering of the notes 
we intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes  which may include the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights or technologies  strategic investments  or additional purchases of common stock 

table of contents the number of shares acquired and the timing of the repurchases are based on several factors  including general market conditions and the trading price of our common stock 
these purchases were made from time to time in the open market  and they were funded from available working capital 
the purpose of our stock repurchase program is  among other things  to help offset the dilution caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock option plans 
in april  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock at any time until april as of april   we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million 
in april  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to an additional million of our common stock 
under this program  we repurchased  of our common stock for million for the nine months ended december  these repurchased shares are retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
see part ii  item of this report for more information regarding the stock repurchase plan 
we may continue to repurchase shares from time to time  as determined by management under programs approved by the board of directors 
the timing and terms of the transactions will depend on market conditions  our liquidity  and other considerations 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
given our cash balances  it is less likely but still possible that we may require or desire additional funds to support our operating expenses and capital requirements or for other purposes  such as acquisitions  and may raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time  and any financing we obtain might be dilutive to our stockholders 
contractual obligations and operating leases the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payment due by period and and and total beyond operating lease obligations operating lease payments future sublease income net operating lease obligations debt obligations principal payments interest payments other obligations holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to the full principle amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest on march   march   and march   or upon the occurrence of certain events including a change in control 
we have the right to redeem some or all of the notes after march  other purchase obligations and commitments include minimum royalty payments under license agreements and do not include purchase obligations discussed below 
our contractual obligations for include the lease term for our headquarters office in redwood city  california  which is from december  to december  minimum contractual lease payments are million  million  and million for the years ending december    and  respectively 
the information also excludes the million of unrecognized tax benefits discussed in note income taxes  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report because it is not possible to estimate the time period that it might be paid to tax authorities 

table of contents contractual obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of certain goods and services are not included in the preceding table 
we cannot determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations because purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum  or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones are not included in the table above 
we base our estimates of the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
operating leases we lease certain office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
during   and  we recorded facilities restructuring charges related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas 
operating lease payments in the table above include approximately million  net of actual sublease income  for operating lease commitments for those facilities that are included in restructuring charges 
see note facilities restructuring charges and note commitments and contingencies  of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
of these future minimum lease payments  we have million recorded in the restructuring and excess facilities accrual at december  this accrual  in addition to minimum lease payments of million  includes estimated operating expenses of million  is net of estimated sublease income of million  and is net of the present value impact of million recorded in accordance with sfas no 
we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based on existing sublease agreements and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
in relation to our excess facilities  we may decide to negotiate and enter into lease termination agreements  if and when the circumstances are appropriate 
these lease termination agreements would likely require that a significant amount of the remaining future lease payments be paid at the time of execution of the agreement  but would release us from future lease payment obligations for the abandoned facility 
the timing of a lease termination agreement and the corresponding payment could materially affect our cash flows in the period of payment 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different 
we have sublease agreements for leased office space in scotts valley  and at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california 
in the event the sublessees are unable to fulfill their obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the leases 
we expect at this time that the sublessees will fulfill their obligations under the terms of the current lease agreements 
in february  we entered into two lease agreements for two buildings at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california our former corporate headquarters  which we occupied from august through december the lease expires in july as part of these agreements  we have purchased certificates of deposit totaling million as a security deposit for lease payments 
other uses of cash in january and december  in connection with the similarity and itemfield acquisitions  we used approximately million and million cash  respectively  as part of the consideration 
a portion of our cash may be further used to 
table of contents acquire or invest in other complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use other complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products  or technologies 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
we may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions 
letters of credit a financial institution has issued a million letter of credit  which requires us to maintain certificates of deposit as collateral until the leases expire in this letter of credit is for our former corporate headquarters leases at the pacific shores center in redwood city  california 
in may  another financial institution issued a million letter of credit for our australia lease 
these certificates of deposit are classified as long term restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet 
the letters of credit of million and million currently bear interest of and  respectively 
there are no financial covenant requirements under our letters of credit 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  or transactions  arrangements or relationships with special purpose entities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure to offset the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   we did not hold derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer  or type of investment 
our investments consist primarily of us government notes and bonds  auction rate securities  corporate bonds  commercial paper and municipal securities 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
see note cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  of notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the following table presents the fair value of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk and the average interest rate as of december  and dollars in thousands years ended december  cash and short term investments average rate of return our cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
as of december   we had net unrealized gains of million associated with these securities 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would change by approximately million 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our 
table of contents investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not necessarily expect to realize an adverse impact on income or cash flows 
at this time  we expect our average rate of return to drop by approximately to basis points during foreign currency risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force and indirect channel partners in north america  europe  asia pacific  and latin america 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenue and operating expenses has not been material 
operating expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries are denominated primarily in local currencies 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we will continue to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency  except for informatica cayman ltd  which is in euros 
our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in foreign currencies  in particular the euro and british pound  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in those foreign currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
our foreign operations  however  in most instances act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are generally denominated in their respective local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of foreign currencies against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenditures will be lower as well 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes
