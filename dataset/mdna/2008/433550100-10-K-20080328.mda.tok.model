as used herein  fiscal year and fiscal refers to the applicable fiscal year ending in january of the applicable calendar year 
as used herein  calendar or calendar year refers to the eleven months ended december  and calendar or calendar year refers to the year ended december  company overview the company is a leading provider of advanced embroidery  screenprinting and textile laser equipment and related value added products and services to the north american decorated apparel marketplace 
the company offers a complete line of technologically advanced embroidery and screenprinting machines  textile laser machines  proprietary application software and a diverse line of supplies and accessories 
hirsch believes its comprehensive customer service  user training  software support through pulse and broad product offerings combine to place the company in a competitive position within its marketplace 
the company sells embroidery machines manufactured by tajima and tajima usa  inc tui  screen printing machines manufactured by mhm  textile laser machines manufactured by seit as well as a wide variety of supplies and accessories 
the company grew rapidly from the time of its initial public offering in through fiscal growth during this period was fueled by rapid technological advances in software and hardware  the strong demand for embroidered products  the creation of new embroidery applications and the strength of the embroidery entrepreneur as a growing segment of the marketplace 
the company believes that the purchasers of smaller embroidery machines are a significant source of repeat business for the sale of additional embroidery machines as the entrepreneurs operations expand 
the market is and has been affected by the fluctuating value in foreign exchange of the us dollar versus the yen resulting in dollar price pressure for machine sales 
most japanese based equipment competitors in the industry including the company faced difficulty in meeting these new market demands 
in fiscal  the company initiated a restructuring program to address the market shifts in the industry  including closing and consolidating certain divisions  reducing total employment  and consolidating facilities that were no longer required to support its new business model 
in fiscal  the company completed its plan of restructuring and reversed  as a reduction of operating expenses   of restructuring costs that had been accrued for remaining severance costs associated with the restructuring and for its lease termination in solon  ohio 
in april  our board of directors approved a change in our fiscal year from a week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in the last month of each quarterly period in the year end january to the period ending december each year 
in this report we compare the eleven month period ended december  to the year ended december  because it is not practical to recast the prior year comparative period ended december  for purposes of discussion  calendar represents the twelve months ended december   calendar year represents the eleven month period ended december   and fiscal year represents the fiscal year ended january during calendar the company added a line of textile lasers by seit and in calendar  the company expanded its product line by adding mhm screenprinting equipment 
the company believes that these added products will help strengthen its position in the decorated apparel market

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of hirsch s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results are likely to differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition the company distributes embroidery  screenprinting and laser equipment that it offers for sale 
where installation and customer acceptance are a substantive part of the sale by its terms  the company has deferred recognition of the revenue until such customer acceptance of installation has occurred 
in calendar   and fiscal  most sales of new equipment did not require installation as a substantive part of sales  and accordingly  the company recorded its sales at the time the machinery was shipped 
service revenues which are not material and costs are recognized when services are provided 
sales of software are recognized when shipped since no post contract or support obligations remain 
sales of parts and supplies are recognized when shipped 
long lived assets the company reviews its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  identifiable intangibles and purchased technologies  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of its long lived assets  the company evaluates the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the assets 
income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future tax consequences resulting from temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company provides a valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
an estimate of uncollectable amounts is made by management based upon historical bad debts  current customer receivable balances  age of customer receivable balances  the customer s financial condition and current economic trends 
if the actual uncollected amounts significantly exceed the estimated allowance  then the company s operating results could be significantly adversely affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out weighted average cost method for supplies and parts and specific cost for embroidery and screenprinting machines and peripherals 
the inventory balance is recorded net of an estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory 
the estimated allowance for obsolete or unmarketable inventory is based upon management s understanding of market conditions and forecasts of future product demand 
if the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory significantly exceeds the estimated allowance  the company s cost of sales  gross profit and net income loss could be significantly adversely affected 
warranty the company provides a five year limited warranty for its embroidery machines and a one year limited warranty for its screenprinting machines 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of satisfying future warranty claims on a quarterly basis 
in estimating its future warranty obligations  the company considers various relevant factors  including the company s stated warranty policies and practices  the historical frequency of claims  and the cost to replace or repair its products under warranty 
if the number of actual warranty claims or the cost of satisfying warranty claims significantly exceeds the estimated warranty reserve  the company s operating expenses and net income loss could be significantly adversely affected 
stock based compensation the company had previously accounted for its stock based employee compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost was reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the common stock on the date of grant 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  share based payment  sfas r a revision of sfas which supercedes apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees 
as of january   the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimate 
accordingly  the company s unaudited consolidated financial statements for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect the adoption of sfas r 
because the company previously adopted only the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas  it will recognize compensation cost relating to the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the date of adoption using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosures under sfas  except that forfeiture rates will be estimated for all options  as required by sfas r 
the cumulative effect of applying the forfeiture rates is not material 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized  and  respectively  of non cash compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations  attributable to stock options granted or vested subsequent to january  the company used the black scholes valuation model and straight line amortization of compensation expense over the requisite service period of the grant see note m
