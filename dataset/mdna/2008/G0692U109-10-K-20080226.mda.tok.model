table of contents the following is a discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the years ended december   and and our financial condition at december  and this should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this report 
tabular dollars are in thousands  except per share amounts 
amounts in tables may not reconcile due to rounding differences 
financial measures we believe the following financial indicators are important in evaluating our performance and measuring the overall growth in value generated for our common shareholders return on average common equity roace roace represents the level of net income available to common shareholders generated from the average of the opening and closing common shareholders equity during the period 
our objective is to generate superior returns on capital that appropriately reward our common shareholders for the risks we assume and to grow revenue only when we deem the returns meet or exceed our requirements 
roace was for compared to and for and  respectively 
diluted book value per common share diluted book value per common share represents total common shareholders equity divided by the number of common shares and diluted common share equivalents outstanding  using the treasury stock method 
we consider diluted book value per common share an appropriate measure of our returns to common shareholders  as we believe growth in our book value on a diluted basis ultimately translates into growth of our stock price 
diluted book value per share was  and at december   and  respectively 
the increase in each of the last two years reflects the generation of earnings from operations  which substantially increased our common shareholders equity base 
cash dividends per common share our dividend policy is an integral part of the value we create for our shareholders 
our cash dividends declared in were per common share compared to and per common share in and  respectively 
our board of directors reviews our dividend policy on a regular basis and in december  they authorized a increase in the quarterly dividend 
consolidated results of operations overview the following table breaks out net income into three components  underwriting income  investment income and net realized gains losses  and other revenues and expenses 
underwriting income on a segment basis is a measure of underwriting profitability that takes into account net premiums earned and other insurance related income as revenue and net losses and loss expenses  acquisition costs and underwriting related general and administrative costs as expenses 
underwriting income is the difference between these revenue and expense items 
because our investment portfolio is managed on a total return basis  we have reviewed investment income and net realized gains losses together 
other revenues and expenses represent corporate expenses  foreign exchange gains losses  interest expense and income tax expense 
year ended december  percentage change percentage change underwriting income insurance reinsurance investment income and net realized gains losses other revenues and expenses net income preferred share dividends net income available to common shareholders 
table of contents versus net income available to common shareholders for increased over  reflecting higher investment income and additional underwriting income from our insurance and reinsurance segments 
the increase in investment income was primarily driven by a increase in our average cash and investment balances together with an increase in our effective yield 
our insurance and reinsurance segments both benefited from additional prior period reserve development in compared with  in what were years of limited major loss activity 
versus net income available to common shareholders for increased from  primarily reflecting additional underwriting income from our segments  higher investment income and positive changes in foreign exchanges gains losses 
the increase in segmental underwriting income was attributable to an absence of major loss activity in compared to when we incurred significant losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma krw 
the increase in investment income was driven by a increase in our average cash and investment balances  an increase in our effective yield and increased income from other investments 
underwriting revenues gross premiums written gross premiums written by segment were as follows year ended december  percentage change percentage change insurance reinsurance total versus gross premiums written in were largely flat relative to in our insurance segment  increases in political risk  professional lines and us exposed catastrophe property premium were offset by the impact of competitive market conditions and rate pressures in our other lines 
in our reinsurance segment  favorable foreign exchange rates in relative to offset an otherwise slight reduction in gross premiums written this year 
this reduction was primarily due to a large month property proportional treaty written in the fourth quarter of which did not come up for renewal in and also the impact of increased client retentions in our professional lines book 
these reductions were mostly offset by our increased participation in business in the us and european reinsurance markets this year 
versus gross premiums written in increased over  primarily reflecting growth in our insurance segment 
this was largely generated by additional underwriting resource and the targeting of new opportunities in our political risk book as well as significant rate increases within parts of our property book 
in our reinsurance segment  growth in our liability and professional lines business was offset by lower reinstatement premiums on our catastrophe line 
in  we recorded significant reinstatement premiums following krw 
excluding these reinstatement premiums  gross premiums written in our reinsurance segment increased in net premiums written net premiums written by segment were as follows year ended december  percentage change percentage change insurance reinsurance total ceded premium point change point change insurance reinsurance total 
table of contents versus the reduction in net premiums written in was primarily due to an increase in premiums ceded in our insurance segment 
this increase was partially due to a change in business mix towards lines with higher levels of ceded premium 
we also purchased additional quota share reinsurance on our professional lines business and expanded our worldwide property program during the year 
versus the growth in net premiums written in was impacted by significant inward and outward reinstatement premiums in  associated with krw 
excluding these amounts  net premiums written in our insurance and reinsurance segments increased by and  respectively  primarily reflecting growth in gross premiums written 
net premium earned net premiums earned by segment were as follows percentage change year ended december  to to insurance reinsurance total versus although net premiums earned in were largely flat with  we experienced a shift in mix from insurance to reinsurance business 
our reinsurance segment benefited from growth of its underwriting operations in recent years  while changes in business mix and an expansion of our reinsurance coverage had the effect of reducing net premiums earned in our insurance segment 
versus the growth in net premiums earned in was impacted by significant reinstatement premiums earned and amortized in  following krw 
excluding these amounts  net premiums earned in our insurance and reinsurance segments increased by and  respectively  primarily reflecting growth in net premiums written in the year 
the rate of growth in our insurance segment was reduced by changes in business mix 
underwriting expenses the following table provides a break down of our combined ratio year ended december  point change point change loss ratio acquisition cost ratio general and administrative expense ratio combined ratio our general and administration expense ratio includes corporate expenses not allocated to our underwriting segments of  and  for  and  respectively 
these costs are discussed further in other revenue and expenses below 
loss ratio the table below shows the components of our net loss and loss expense ratio loss ratio year ended december  point change point change current year prior period development loss ratio 
table of contents current year loss ratios the movements in our current year loss ratios primarily reflect changes in business mix and the level of loss activity each year  rather than from any significant changes in our underlying actuarial assumptions 
we experienced below average catastrophe and attritional loss activity during and  compared to when we incurred significant losses on krw 
our insurance and reinsurance segments have both experienced a shift in business mix towards longer tail lines in recent years 
because our long tail lines typically have a higher initial expected loss ratio relative to our short tail lines  this resulted in a slight increase in our current year loss ratios in the last two years  when isolated from all other variables 
during  a number of large financial institutions incurred significant financial losses relating to delinquencies in the us sub prime residential mortgage market 
many other companies were also negatively impacted by the write down of investments exposed to the credit market deterioration 
these events triggered claims against directors and officers of these institutions as well as providers of professional services 
we have reviewed our portfolio for any potential losses relating to these events  including a contract by contract analysis of our exposure to all known suits filed 
as a result  we identified potential exposure on some directors and officers and errors and omissions contracts within our insurance segment 
while this resulted in a slight increase to the initial expected loss ratios on these related line classes  overall  the current accident year loss ratio on our professional lines book was consistent with due to the offsetting impact of business mix changes within this book 
with regard to the professional lines within our reinsurance business  given the emergence of bankruptcies and other business failures  and the uncertainty in this area  we increased our initial expected loss ratio on those potentially impacted classes 
however  this did not have a significant impact on our overall reinsurance current year loss ratio in as compared with prior period reserve development prior period development was the net favorable result of several underlying reserve developments on prior accident years  identified during our quarterly reserving process 
the following table provides a break down of prior period development by segment year ended december  insurance reinsurance total the amounts above were almost entirely generated from our short tail lines of business 
for our long tail lines  our loss experience from older accident years is generally considered insufficiently developed as yet to recognize deviations from our initial expectations 
we have also experienced some adverse reserve development in the last three years  most notably in  when we strengthened our krw reserves by million  or ratio points 
the size and complexity of krw resulted in some claims that increased over previously reported damage estimates 
favorable development on our short tail lines has primarily been due to there being significantly fewer late reported claims than we anticipated in our reserving process 
the deviation between expected and actual claims experience is often greater for a company like ours that has a limited operating history and therefore relies more heavily upon industry based loss development profiles 
given the inherent limitations of this  our estimate of ultimate losses in prior years have included a provision for reporting delays and other uncertainties specific to our business 
these include the inherent delays we expect to arise from obtaining loss information on excess layers of business across our diverse worldwide exposures 
as it has transpired  our actual claims experience in the last three years has been better than we projected  with late reporting being less prevalent than we anticipated 
in addition to this broader claims experience  favorable reserve development has also occurred as a result of us being able to take down provisions for specific catastrophe events 
on contracts that respond to highly visible  major events  we establish ibnr where potential exposure has been identified 
however  in a number of instances  mainly within our excess of loss catastrophe reinsurance business  it transpired that claims did not develop to a sufficient level to reach our attachment points 
for further detail on the prior period development refer to the segment discussions below 
conditions and trends that affected the development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future 
accordingly  it is inappropriate to anticipate future redundancies or deficiencies based on historical experience 

table of contents acquisition cost ratio acquisition costs relate to the commissions  taxes and other fees paid to obtain business offset by commissions received on ceded premiums 
typically  our acquisition costs are based on a percentage of the premium written and vary by each line of business that we underwrite 
versus our acquisition cost ratio in of was comparable with while we experienced a shift in business mix towards reinsurance business  which typically has higher acquisition costs compared to our insurance segment  costs in our insurance segment were lower this year 
this was due to an increase in ceding commissions received as a result of our expanded reinsurance program 
our gross acquisition cost ratio in of was consistent with the prior year 
versus our acquisition cost ratio in of  increased by ratio points over  primarily reflecting changes in business mix in our insurance segment 
general and administrative ratio versus our general and administrative ratio in of  increased by ratio points over  primarily reflecting the costs associated with growing the infrastructure of our business 
in particular  we incurred higher staffing costs in relating to the expansion of our insurance operations in the us  including those related to our acquisition of the media pro business in the second quarter 
versus our general and administrative ratio in of  increased by ratio points over  primarily reflecting an increase in incentive compensation costs which are tied to our operating results 
investment income and net realized investment gains losses our investment portfolio is structured to preserve capital and provide us with a high level of liquidity 
additionally  we invest our portfolio with a focus on total return rather than establishing yield or income targets 
the following table provides a breakdown of net investment income and net realized investment gains losses at december  percentage change percentage change fixed maturities cash and cash equivalents other investments gross investment income investment expense net investment income net realized investment gains losses net investment income and net realized investment gains losses average investment balances cash and fixed maturity investments other investments total cash and investments the average investment balances are calculated by taking the average of the month end balances during the year 

table of contents net investment income versus net investment income in increased versus reflecting larger investment balances and higher effective yields 
the increase in average cash and investment balances primarily reflects positive operating cash flows during the year 
our annualized effective yield on invested assets assets under management by external investment managers was in compared to in the increase was principally due to higher us interest rates at the short and intermediate parts of the yield curve 
partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in investment income from our other investments 
this mainly resulted from the net sale of million of clo s during the year which reduced interest income thereon  coupled with unrealized losses from our credit related funds which was associated with the broad widening of credit spreads in the fixed income markets during the second half of refer to the cash and investments section below for further discussion 
versus net investment income in increased versus reflecting larger investment balances  higher effective yields and increased income from our other investments 
the increase in average cash and investment balances primarily reflects positive operating cash flows during and capital raising activity in late our annualized effective yield on invested assets was in compared to in the increase was principally due to higher us interest rates at the short end of the yield curve 
the increase in investment income from our other investments was principally the result of higher allocations combined with better returns in from those investments 
net realized investment gains losses our investment strategy is to take a long term view by actively managing our investment portfolio to maximize total return see below within specific guidelines  designed to minimize risk 
our fixed maturities portfolio is considered available for sale and reported at fair value 
the effect of market movements on our available for sale investment portfolio impacts net income through net realized gains losses when securities are sold or when other than temporary impairments are recorded on invested assets 
additionally  net income is impacted through net realized gains losses by changes in the fair value of investment derivatives  mainly forward contracts 
changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available for sale securities  which result from the revaluation of securities held  are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
the following table provides a breakdown of our net realized investment gains losses year ended december  on sale of fixed maturities other than temporary impairments change in fair value of investment derivatives net realized investment gains losses the majority of our portfolio is invested in the fixed income market and as a result the level of realized gains and losses on these investments are highly correlated to fluctuations in yields 
the effect of increasing yields throughout and negatively impacted the price of fixed maturity securities resulting in realized losses 
in  our non us dollar portfolios were positively impacted by strengthening exchange rates  when coupled with a rally in the us fixed income market in the second half of the year generated realized gains 
the other than temporary impairment charge in was related to the write down of fixed income securities 
these securities were not concentrated to any particular type of investment or sector 

table of contents total return the following table provides a breakdown of our total return year ended december  net investment income net realized investments gains losses change in unrealized gains losses total average cash and investments total return on average cash and investments our portfolio is managed to maximize total return within certain guidelines and constraints 
in assessing returns under this approach  we include net investment income  net realized investment gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses generated by our investment portfolio 
versus the increase in our total return was primarily due to higher average yields in versus  coupled with positive market value movements in us treasury securities 
this was partially offset by broad re pricing of risk that increased spreads in the corporate  mortgage and asset backed sectors  which negatively impacted the pricing of these securities 
versus the increase in our total return between and was due to a growing allocation to our higher returning other investments and more significantly an increase in short and intermediate us interest rates which stemmed from the increases in the federal funds rate which began in the mid part of and continued in and despite the steady increase in yield over this period  the magnitude of the rate increases in had such a negative impact on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio that the realized losses and unrealized losses more than offset the increase in yield in that year 
other revenues and expenses the following table provides a breakdown of our other revenues and expenses year ended december  percentage change percentage change corporate expenses foreign exchange gains losses   nm  interest expense income tax expense total nm not meaningful corporate expenses our corporate expenses include holding company costs necessary to support our worldwide insurance and reinsurance operations and costs associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
as a percentage of net premiums earned  corporate expenses were  and for  and  respectively 

table of contents foreign exchange gains losses some of our business is written in currencies other than us dollars 
the gains in were principally made on the remeasurement of net asset balances denominated in euro  the australian dollar and the canadian dollar  following an appreciation of these currencies against the us dollar of  and  respectively 
the gains in were principally made on the remeasurement of net asset balances denominated in sterling and euro  following an appreciation of these currencies against the us dollar  while in  the depreciation of these same currencies against the us dollar  drove the foreign exchange losses that year 
interest expense interest expense primarily includes interest due on the senior notes we issued in in  it also included interest costs of million incurred on a million repurchase agreement we entered into in december to finance our life settlement investment 
we terminated this agreement in september  for further information refer to item  note b of the consolidated financial statements 
income tax expense income tax expense is generated primarily through our foreign operations in the united states and europe 
our effective tax rate on net income  which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax  was for compared with in and in changes in our effective tax rate in the last two years primarily reflect variances in the distribution of net income among our various taxable jurisdictions 
results by segment insurance segment overview results from our insurance segment were as follows year ended december  percentage change percentage change revenues gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned other insurance related income loss expenses current year net losses and loss expenses prior period reserve development acquisition costs general and administrative expenses underwriting income point change point change ratios current year loss ratio prior period reserve development acquisition cost ratio general and administrative ratio combined ratio versus in  underwriting income in our insurance segment increased over the prior year  primarily due to higher levels of prior period reserve development 
underwriting income otherwise decreased during  reflecting a reduction in net premiums earned and an increase in our general and administrative expenses 
the reduction in net premiums earned was primarily due to an increase in premiums ceded this year  associated with an expansion of our reinsurance coverage and also changes in business mix 
the increase in our general and administrative cost ratio was partially related to the reduction in net premiums earned but was also due to the costs of growing our underwriting platform  in particular those costs associated with the media pro business we purchased during the year 

table of contents versus underwriting income in increased significantly over  reflecting an absence of major catastrophes in compared to when we incurred significant losses from krw 
the increase in net premiums earned in was driven by lower ceded premiums amortized which were significantly higher in following ceded reinstatements on krw 
insurance premiums gross premiums written the following table provides gross premiums written by line of business percentage change year ended december  to to property marine terrorism aviation political risk professional lines liability accident and health total to facilitate period to period comparisons  certain amounts previously included in our property and liability lines in previous years have been reclassified to our marine line of business to conform to our current presentation 
versus in general  market conditions globally were increasingly competitive during and  as a result  we experienced increased pricing pressure across many of our insurance lines 
the overall stability of gross premiums written in versus reflects our breadth of products and markets worldwide  which gives us the flexibility to allocate capacity where we see the best rated opportunities 
political risk premium can vary considerably between periods depending on the timing of transactions 
however  additional underwriters in this line have allowed us to increase the number of contracts written this year  the majority of which were related to emerging market sovereign and corporate credit insurance 
the other notable increase in was on our professional lines book 
this was largely associated with renewal rights acquired in the may purchase of the media pro business 
other than us exposed catastrophe property business  which continued to present good opportunities  market conditions in our other lines of business continued to be less favorable during this largely limited our ability to expand these lines  although we continued to seek out the better priced and structured opportunities 
versus gross premiums written in increased versus  reflecting growth in several lines of business 
the increase in property premium was primarily due to significant rate increases for natural peril exposed property and offshore energy risks in the us and gulf of mexico  following krw 
gross premiums written in our political risk book increased through a combination of additional underwriting resource and new market opportunities 
our professional lines unit generated additional premiums during reflecting an expansion of our london and us operations in recent years 
the increase in premium in our marine line was largely associated with growth of two custom accounts which we began to write in partially offsetting these increases was our reduced participation for terrorism and aviation business due to pricing considerably below our threshold 
we also experienced a reduction in excess and surplus primary liability premium  which was primarily due to a more competitive market 
premiums ceded versus premiums ceded in were million  or of gross premiums written  compared with million  or of gross premiums written in the increase in premiums ceded was largely related to the impact of changes in business mix and additional reinsurance cover purchased during the year 
while we significantly reduced gross premiums written on our aviation and terrorism lines during  we offset these reductions with growth of our political risk  property and professional lines business 
because we have historically purchased more reinsurance cover on our property and professional lines business relative to our aviation and terrorism lines  this change in business mix had the effect of increasing our ceded premium ratio 
furthermore  we also purchased additional coverage this year  both on our professional lines quota share reinsurance and also on our worldwide property program 
versus premiums ceded in were million  or of gross premiums written  compared with million  or of gross premiums written in the decrease was primarily due to lower ceded reinstatement premiums 
these were significantly higher in following our utilization of reinsurance protections on krw 

table of contents net premiums earned the following table provides net premiums earned by line of business percentage change year ended december  to to property marine terrorism aviation political risk professional lines liability accident and health total to facilitate period to period comparisons  certain amounts previously included in our property and liability lines in previous years have been reclassified to our marine line of business to conform to our current presentation 
versus the decrease in net premiums earned in largely reflects an reduction in net premiums written in the year  associated with the increase in premiums ceded 
versus the growth in net premium earned in was impacted by krw related ceded reinstatement premiums  amortized in net premiums earned otherwise increased  compared with growth in net premiums written in the year of also excluding krw reinstatements 
net premium earned growth was reduced by the fact that a significant portion of our net premium written in was generated from our political risk book 
this business typically provides multi year coverage and therefore the earning of this premium is spread over a greater number of periods 
in addition  premiums earned on our aviation line decreased significantly in having substantially reduced our participation for this business in recent years 
insurance losses loss ratio the table below shows the components of our loss ratio year ended december  point change point change current year prior period reserve development loss ratio current year loss ratios the movements in our current year loss ratios primarily reflect changes in business mix and the level of loss activity each year  rather than from any significant changes in our underlying actuarial assumptions 
versus our current year loss ratio in was relatively flat compared with although changes in business mix increased our current year ratio in  this was largely offset by lower attritional losses in the year  most notably on our energy onshore account 
during  we experienced a shift in business mix from aviation and terrorism lines to our professional lines account 
our professional lines business typically has a higher initial expected loss ratio than our aviation and terrorism lines 
versus our current year loss ratio in was ratio points lower than in  reflecting an absence of major catastrophe losses in compared to when we incurred significant losses on krw 

table of contents prior period reserve development we recognized net favorable prior period reserve development of million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
these amounts were almost entirely generated from our short tail lines of business 
for our long tail lines  our loss experience on older accident years is generally considered insufficiently developed as yet to recognize deviations from our initial expectations 
the only two significant exceptions to this both occurred during first  we recognized million  or ratio points  of favorable development on our directors and officers liability business 
this related to a specific claim  which we had previously made provision for  but removed following a favorable court ruling 
second  we recognized million  or ratio points  of adverse development on our accident year and casualty reserves  due to a higher than expected emergence of claims on a specific program 
the net favorable reserve development on our short tail lines  which we have recognized due to the emergence of better than expected loss experience  is summarized as follows the largest component of favorable development in was on our property lines from accident year for these lines  accident year has largely proven to be a benign loss year with limited late reported loss activity and minimal deterioration on previously reported claims 
the balance of the favorable development in was generated from our accident year and aviation  marine and property lines 
accident year included adverse development on claims arising from krw of approximately million  or ratio points 
the majority of this development was on our property and energy offshore lines 
the nature and extent of krw resulted in some claims that increased over previously reported damage estimates 
we also experienced adverse development of million  or ratio points  on our accident and health business due to a higher than expected emergence of claims 
favorable development in was largely generated by our accident year aviation and property lines and accident year marine lines 
this was partially offset by adverse development of million  or ratio points  on claims arising from krw  and was largely related to losses on our energy offshore account 
in  we generated approximately million  or ratio points  of favorable development on our aviation and terrorism lines  predominately from accident year the majority of this related to changes in our loss development profiles on these lines 
having observed a lack of claim development on our aviation war and terrorism business  we adjusted our reserving assumptions on these lines to incorporate reporting that was more prompt than we had originally expected 
the balance of the other favorable development in was largely generated from our accident year property and energy accounts 
insurance outlook we expect competition and rate pressures to further intensify across the insurance marketplace during the benign insured catastrophe season in combined with increasing capacity in the market is expected to contribute towards an even more competitive pricing environment throughout our property lines 
for catastrophe exposed property and energy business  this pressure is against historically high price levels  and therefore we still foresee the opportunity to target business that meets our pricing threshold 
for us retail property business  we are beginning to witness pressure on terms and conditions  including increased sub limits and lower deductibles  and we continue to maintain our cautious posture on this line 
our aviation and terrorism lines continue to be under significant pricing pressure and we expect to reduce our participation on this business further in in our liability business  we continue to witness increasing competitive pricing pressure  particularly on our larger us excess and surplus accounts 
in our professional lines business  there remain some pricing pressures  although we are now witnessing some moderation in competition in our financial institutions business  driven by the impact of deterioration in the credit markets 
we believe our areas of focus in both our liability and professional lines business still contain good profit potential  but risk selection and overall execution strategy have become more critical 

table of contents reinsurance segment overview results from our reinsurance segment were as follows year ended december  percent change percent change revenues gross premiums written net premiums written net premiums earned other insurance related income expenses current year net losses and loss expenses prior period reserve development acquisition costs general and administrative expenses underwriting income loss   nm  point change point change ratios current year loss ratio prior period reserve development acquisition cost ratio general and administrative ratio combined ratio nm not meaningful versus in  underwriting income in our reinsurance segment increased over the prior year  primarily due to higher levels of prior period reserve development 
underwriting income otherwise decreased during  primarily reflecting an increase in our current year loss ratio 
this was in large part due to changes in our business mix  with a significant portion of our growth in net premium earned this year arising from longer tail lines  which typically have a higher initial expected loss ratio compared to our other business 
versus underwriting income in increased significantly over  reflecting an absence of major loss activity in  compared to when we incurred significant losses from krw 
excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums on krw in  net premiums earned increased in  reflecting growth of our us and european reinsurance business 

table of contents reinsurance premiums gross premiums written the following table provides gross premiums written by line of business percent change year ended december  to to catastrophe property professional lines credit and bond motor liability other total versus gross premiums written in benefited from a weakened dollar relative to in particular  the dollar was weaker against the euro and sterling at our major reinsurance renewal date of january excluding this impact  gross premiums written decreased in  reflecting reductions in our property and professional lines business 
the decrease in property premiums was primarily due to a large month pro rata contract  written in the fourth quarter of our professional lines book was impacted by the non renewal of several large contracts  driven by cedants opting to increase their retention of business 
our other lines of business all reported an increase in gross premiums written in these increases were largely generated from our increased participation in the us and european reinsurance markets  mainly during the january renewal season 
versus gross premiums written in were inflated by significant krw related reinstatement premiums 
excluding the impact of these  which were mostly on our catastrophe book  gross premiums written increased in this growth was primarily due to an expansion of our us and european operations  which allowed us to increase our market penetration for professional lines and liability business in particular 
we also wrote new property exposed engineering business  included within our other line of business 
net premiums earned the following table provides net premiums earned by line of business year ended december  percent change to to catastrophe property professional lines credit and bond motor liability other total in  net premiums earned increased over  while gross premiums written stayed mostly flat 
the correlation between gross premiums written and net premiums earned in a particular calendar year varies depending on normal variability in earning patterns and also period to period changes in business mix 
the composition of premiums written in each of our lines of business varies 
for example  on our catastrophe and motor accounts  we typically write month non proportional contracts  largely in the first quarter of the year 
consequently changes in gross premiums written on these lines more closely align to changes in net premiums earned in a given calendar year 
in contrast  our professional lines premium is written more evenly throughout the year and includes a higher level of proportional business 
consequently  net premiums earned in a calendar year on this line tend to include a significant amount of premium written in prior years 
for example  in  approximately of premium earned on our professional lines business was from prior underwriting years 
overall  the growth in net premiums earned in each of the last two years reflects the expansion of our u 
s and european reinsurance operations in the last several years 

table of contents reinsurance losses loss ratio the table below shows the components of our loss ratio year ended december  point change point change current year prior period reserve development loss ratio current year loss ratios the movements in our current year loss ratios primarily reflect changes in business mix and the level of loss activity each year  rather than from any significant changes in our underlying actuarial assumptions 
versus our current year loss ratio in was ratio points higher compared with  partially reflecting changes in business mix 
we experienced a shift towards liability business  which typically has a higher initial expected loss ratio compared to our other lines 
although there was a higher incidence of mid sized catastrophes in  most notably european windstorm kyrill and flood damages in the uk  our exposure to these events did not have a substantial impact on our total estimated current year losses relative to versus our current year loss ratio in was ratio points lower than in  reflecting an absence of major catastrophe losses in compared to when we incurred significant losses on krw 
prior period reserve development we recognized net favorable development of million  million and million  in  and respectively 
these amounts were almost entirely generated from our short tail lines of business 
for our long tail lines  our loss experience on older accident years is generally considered insufficiently developed as yet to recognize deviations from our initial expectations 
the only significant adverse development on our long tail lines in the last three years was on our motor liability account 
due to higher than expected loss emergence on this account  in we increased our accident year and expected ultimate losses on this account by million  or percentage points 
the net favorable reserve development on our short tail lines  which we have recognized with the emergence of better than expected loss experience  is summarized as follows the majority of the net favorable development in was related to our catastrophe and property lines of business  principally from accident year for these lines  accident year has largely proven to be a benign loss year with limited late reported loss activity and minimal deterioration on previously reported claims 
the majority of net favorable development in was generated from our accident year and catastrophe and property lines of business 
we experienced net adverse development of million  or ratio points  from accident year which was largely related to reserve strengthening on krw reserves 
the nature and extent of krw resulted in some claims that increased over previously reported damage estimates 
favorable development in was primarily generated from our accident year property and catastrophe lines of business 
we also removed several event specific ibnr reserves from our accident year catastrophe line having established that claims on these events did not develop to a sufficient level to reach our attachment points 

table of contents reinsurance segment outlook our treaty reinsurance renewals are progressing well and we are satisfied with the quality  diversity and balance of the portfolio we reassembled at january  typically  approximately of our reinsurance gross premiums written within any calendar year renews on this date 
although we have not yet finalized all the business we expect to bind  we anticipate that our first quarter treaty reinsurance renewals in will represent a modest decline in premium relative to the same period in although overall discipline throughout the global reinsurance marketplace continues  our reinsurance portfolio continues to be impacted by an ongoing trend of cedants retaining more business 
also  as expected  modest catastrophe claims for the reinsurance market has led to some decreases in margins for property reinsurance business  in most  if not all  geographic regions 
however  overall returns generally remain above acceptable levels  in particular  business with major us perils 
although we are experiencing increased competition and pricing pressure on our non property lines in the us and europe  terms and conditions have generally held firm  and we continue to identify opportunities in attractively priced areas 
cash and investments at december  and  total cash and investments  including accrued interest receivable and net receivable payable for investments sold purchased were billion and billion  respectively 
our investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize investment return through a high quality  diversified portfolio 
in this regard  at december  and  our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed maturity investments and cash and cash equivalents 
the composition of our investment portfolio is summarized as follows at december  us government and agency non us government corporate debt mortgage backed asset backed municipals total fixed maturities cash at investment managers  net of unsettled trades total invested assets other cash and cash equivalents total cash and fixed maturities other investments accrued interest receivable total cash and investments fixed maturity investments our investment strategy is to invest primarily in debt instruments of high credit quality issuers and to limit the amount of credit exposure with respect to particular ratings categories and any one issuer 
within our fixed income portfolio  we attempt to limit our credit exposure by purchasing fixed income investments rated bbb or higher 
in addition  we have limited our exposure to any single issuer to or less of our portfolio for securities rated a or above and or less of our portfolio for securities rated between bbb and bbb 
at december  and  we did not have an aggregate exposure to any single issuer of or more of our shareholders equity  other than with respect to us government and agency securities 
at december  and  all of the fixed maturity securities were investment grade with and  respectively  rated aa or better  with an overall weighted average rating of aa  based on ratings assigned by standard poor s 

table of contents the duration target range for our investment portfolios is two to four years 
the duration of an investment is based on the maturity of the security and also reflects the payment of interest and the possibility of early principal payment of such security 
we seek to use investment performance benchmarks that reflect this duration target 
with respect to the duration of our investment portfolio  we manage asset durations to both maximize return given market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments 
in a low interest rate environment  the overall duration of our fixed maturity investments tends to be shorter and in a high interest rate environment  such durations tend to be longer 
at december  and  our invested assets had an approximate average duration of and years  respectively 
when incorporating our other cash and cash equivalents into this calculation  the average duration at december  and is reduced to and years  respectively 
the amortized cost and fair values of our fixed maturity investments was as follows at december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value type of investment us government and agency non us government corporate debt mortgage backed asset backed municipals total fixed maturity investments at december  amortized cost gross unrealized gains gross unrealized losses fair value type of investment us government and agency non us government corporate debt mortgage backed asset backed municipals total fixed maturity investments the increase in the gross unrealized losses of million was due to various changes in yield in the fixed income market 
during the first half of the year  there was a general increase in yields that negatively impacted prices to varying degrees across all fixed income sectors 
in the second half of  a broad re pricing of risk dramatically increased spreads in the corporate  mortgage and asset backed sectors  which negatively impacted the pricing of these securities  but resulted in an increase in demand for us treasuries  which favorably impacted pricing in this sector 
other investments the composition of our other investment portfolio is summarized as follows at december  hedge funds credit funds collateralized loan obligations short duration high yield fund other life settlement contracts total other investments 
table of contents during  we sold our life settlement contracts investment 
as discussed in notes b and c of the consolidated financial statements  in item of this report  on september   we sold our note at par to a related party of the spe buyer  which resulted in the deconsolidation of the life settlement contracts 
on the same day  this note was repurchased by the spe using proceeds from the issuance of a newly issued million year asset backed note to the buyer 
we simultaneously entered into an insurance contract with the buyer whereby we agreed to indemnify the buyer in the event of non payment on the principal of this security 
in doing so  we continue to have an implicit interest in the original life settlements portfolio and the related longevity risk exposure 
however  as a result of not having a direct interest through the note and a new hedging program put in place by the spe  we have significantly reduced our exposure to interest rate risk 
the decreases in our collateralized loan obligations and short duration high yield fund were due to sales and redemptions  respectively  in order to reduce our exposure to credit risk 
the credit funds increased as we subscribed into a credit strategies fund in the fourth quarter to take advantage of the credit market dislocation 
the increase in the hedge funds is due to positive returns generated during the year  including a net redemption of million during the year 
impact of credit market movements during the year  increasing delinquencies in the us sub prime residential mortgage collateral triggered increased volatility and decreased liquidity across financial markets as a whole  particularly in the area of structured credit assets 
we define sub prime related risk as any security that is backed by or contains sub prime collateral even if that sub prime component is incidental 
we do not invest directly in sub prime loans nor do we have any direct sub prime investment commitments 
our exposure to the sub prime sector is within our fixed maturity portfolio as part of the collateral in our mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
we also have exposure to alternative a mortgages which are considered riskier than prime but less risky than sub prime 
the following table summarizes our holdings in these investment types at december  at december  holdings at fair value percentage of cash and investments net unrealized gain loss realized losses and impairments subprime agency mbs subprime non agency mbs subprime abs total subprime alternative a agency mbs alternative a non agency mbs alternative a abs total alternative a total subprime and alternative a mbs and abs denote mortgage backed or asset backed securities  respectively 
the above balances are all held within investment grade tranches  with rated agency or aaa and the remainder rated aa 
the duration and weighted average life of these investments at december  was and years  respectively 
with respect to the rest of our investment portfolio  our exposure to credit risk is broadly diversified by industry  concentration and geography through our investments in high grade fixed maturities and our other investments 
some of the markets for these asset classes have experienced higher than typical volatility during  as a result of the financial market instability and widening credit spreads on corporate and structured credit assets 
however  these market developments did not have a material adverse impact on our results during although we experienced a reduction in net investment income on our credit related funds compared to  these funds still produced positive returns for the year 
our book value was negatively impacted through an increase in unrealized losses on our corporate and asset backed fixed income securities  however  this was more than offset by the positive impact on our us treasury positions 
all asset backed securities  including those with sub prime exposure  are reviewed as part of our ongoing other than temporary impairment monitoring process 
we continue to monitor our exposures  and to the extent market disruptions continue  our financial position may be negatively impacted
