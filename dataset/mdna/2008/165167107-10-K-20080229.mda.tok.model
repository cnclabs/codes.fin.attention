we manage our business as three separate operational segments exploration and production  marketing  and service operations  which is comprised of our wholly owned drilling and trucking operations 
we refer you to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report  which summarizes by segment our net income and capital expenditures for  and and our assets as of december   and executive summary we are the third largest producer of natural gas in the united states first among independents 
we own interests in approximately  producing oil and natural gas wells that are currently producing approximately bcfe per day  of which is natural gas 
our strategy is focused on discovering  acquiring and developing conventional and unconventional natural gas reserves onshore in the us  east of the rocky mountains 
our most important operating area has historically been in various conventional plays in the mid continent region of oklahoma  arkansas  southwestern kansas and the texas panhandle 
at december   of our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were located in the mid continent region 
during the past five years  we have also built significant positions in various conventional and unconventional plays in the fort worth basin in north central texas  the appalachian basin  principally in west virginia  eastern kentucky  eastern ohio  pennsylvania and southern new york  the permian and delaware basins of west texas and eastern new mexico  the ark la tex area of east texas and northern louisiana  and the south texas and texas gulf coast regions 
we have established a top three position in nearly every major unconventional play onshore in the us east of the rockies  including the barnett shale  the arkansas fayetteville shale  the appalachian basin devonian and marcellus shales  the arkoma and ardmore basins woodford shale in oklahoma  the delaware basin barnett and woodford shales in west texas  and the alabama conasauga and chattanooga shales 
oil and natural gas production for was bcfe  an increase of bcfe  or over the bcfe produced in we have increased our production for consecutive years and consecutive quarters 
during these quarters  chesapeake s us production has increased for an average compound quarterly growth rate of and an average compound annual growth rate of 
during  chesapeake continued the industry s most active drilling program and drilled  gross  net operated wells and participated in another  gross net wells operated by other companies 
the company s drilling success rate was for company operated wells and for non operated wells 
also during  we invested billion in operated wells using an average of operated rigs and million in non operated wells using an average of non operated rigs 
total costs incurred in oil and natural gas acquisition  exploration and development activities during  including seismic  unproved properties  leasehold  capitalized interest and internal costs  non cash tax basis step up and asset retirement obligations  were billion 
chesapeake began with estimated proved reserves of tcfe and ended the year with tcfe  an increase of tcfe  or

our annual decline rate on producing properties is projected to be from to  from to  from to  from to and from to our percentage of proved undeveloped reserve additions to total proved reserve additions was approximately in  in and in based on our current drilling schedule and budget  we expect that virtually all of the proved undeveloped reserves added in will begin producing within the next three to five years 
generally  proved developed reserves are producing at the time they are added or will begin producing within one year 
since  chesapeake has invested billion in new leasehold and d seismic acquisitions and now owns what we believe are the largest combined inventories of onshore leasehold million net acres and d seismic million acres in the us on this leasehold  the company has approximately  net drillsites representing more than a year inventory of drilling projects 
as of december   the company s debt as a percentage of total capitalization total capitalization is the sum of debt and stockholders equity was compared to as of december  the average maturity of our long term debt is almost nine years with an average interest rate of approximately 
liquidity and capital resources financial plan in early september  we announced an enhanced financial plan designed to monetize unrecognized balance sheet value and to fully fund our planned capital expenditures through without accessing public capital markets 
since then  we have successfully implemented multiple aspects of the plan and anticipate further progress during and we believe our planned transactions described below will allow us to monetize approximately billion of assets by the end of sale leasebacks 
during  we entered into sale leaseback transactions involving drilling rigs for net proceeds of approximately million 
we now operate a total of rigs under sale leaseback arrangements and anticipate similar transactions on our remaining rigs during  thereby completing the sale leaseback of our entire fleet of drilling rigs 
also during  we completed a sale leaseback facility for our natural gas compression assets 
we received approximately million for the sale leaseback of our existing natural gas compression assets  and we will finance up to million of future natural gas compression assets under the same facility 
producing property sales 
in december  we monetized a portion of our proved reserves and production in certain chesapeake operated producing assets in kentucky and west virginia 
in this transaction  we sold a volumetric production payment vpp to affiliates of ubs ag and db energy trading llc a subsidiary of deutsche bank ag for proceeds of approximately billion 
the vpp entitles the purchaser to receive scheduled quantities of natural gas from chesapeake s interests in over  producing wells  free of all production costs and production taxes  over a year period 
the transaction included approximately bcfe of proved reserves and mmcfe per day of net production  or approximately of our proved reserves and net production as of december  we have retained drilling rights on the properties below currently producing intervals and outside of existing producing wellbores 
in addition  we plan to pursue monetizations of similarly mature properties in and for estimated proceeds of approximately billion 
in the first quarter of  we sold non core oil and natural gas assets in the rocky mountains and in the arkoma basin woodford shale play for proceeds of approximately million 
midstream partnership 
we are currently in the process of forming a private partnership to own a non operating interest in our midstream natural gas assets outside of appalachia  which consist primarily of natural gas gathering systems and treating assets 
we anticipate raising billion in the first half of by selling a minority interest in the partnership

index to financial statements sources and uses of funds cash flow from operations is our primary source of liquidity to meet operating expenses and fund capital expenditures other than for acquisitions outside our budgeted leasehold and property acquisitions 
cash provided by operating activities was billion in  compared to billion in and billion in the million increase from to was primarily due to higher volumes of oil and natural gas production 
the billion increase from to was primarily due to higher realized prices and higher volumes of oil and natural gas production 
changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income  excluding non cash items  such as depreciation  depletion and amortization  deferred income taxes and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives 
net income decreased to billion in from billion in compared to million in and is discussed below under results of operations 
changes in market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact the level of our cash flow from operations 
while a decline in oil or natural gas prices would affect the amount of cash flow that would be generated from operations  we currently as of february  have oil hedges in place covering of our expected oil production in and of our expected natural gas production in  thereby providing price certainty for a substantial portion of our future cash flow 
our oil and natural gas hedges as of december  are detailed in item a of part ii of this report 
we have arrangements with our hedging counterparties that allow us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations in the value of our oil and natural gas hedges by making collateral allocations from our bank credit facility or directly pledging oil and natural gas properties  rather than posting cash or letters of credit with the counterparties 
depending on changes in oil and natural gas futures markets and management s view of underlying oil and natural gas supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
our bank credit facility is another source of liquidity 
on november   we amended and restated our syndicated revolving bank credit facility to increase the borrowing base to billion with commitments of billion and extended the maturity to november we subsequently increased the commitments under the credit facility to billion 
the amendment reflects the increased scale and scope of our operations and will help accommodate timing differences between cash flow from operations  asset monetizations and planned capital expenditures 
at february   there was million of borrowing capacity available under the revolving bank credit facility 
we use the facility to fund daily operating activities and acquisitions as needed 
we borrowed billion and repaid billion in  we borrowed billion and repaid billion in  and we borrowed billion and repaid billion in under the bank credit facility 
in  we completed two public offerings of our contingent convertible senior notes due in the first offering  in may  we issued billion of notes and in the second offering  in august  we issued million of notes 
net proceeds of approximately billion and million  respectively  were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility

table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe our cash flow from operations  in combination with the proceeds expected from our planned producing property monetizations and other asset sales and the billion increase in capacity under our bank credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our business strategy without accessing the public capital markets for the foreseeable future 
we intend to use any cash in excess of our operating and capital expenditure needs to pay down indebtedness under our revolving bank credit facility 
our primary use of funds is on capital expenditures for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties 
we refer you to the table under investing transactions below  which sets forth the components of our oil and natural gas investing activities for  and our drilling  land and seismic capital expenditures are currently budgeted at billion to billion in we believe this level of exploration and development will enable us to increase our proved oil and natural gas reserves by more than in and increase our total production by to in inclusive of acquisitions completed or scheduled to close in through the filing date of this report but without regard to any additional acquisitions that may be completed in 
we retain a significant degree of control over the timing of our capital expenditures which permits us to defer or accelerate certain capital expenditures if necessary to address any potential liquidity issues 
in addition  higher drilling and field operating costs  drilling results that alter planned development schedules  acquisitions or other factors could cause us to revise our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
we paid dividends on our common stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on common stock from to per share beginning with the dividend paid in july we paid dividends on our preferred stock of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  holders of our series cumulative convertible preferred stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock exchanged  shares and  shares for  and  shares of common stock  respectively  in public exchange offers 
the exchange resulted in a loss on conversion of million 
we received million  million and million from the exercise of employee and director stock options in  and  respectively 
we paid million and million to purchase treasury stock in and  respectively 
of these amounts  million and million were used to fund our matching contribution to our k plans in and  respectively 
the remaining million in was used to purchase shares of common stock to be used upon the exercise of stock options under certain stock option plans 
there were no treasury stock purchases made in in  and  we paid million  million and million  respectively  to settle a portion of the derivative liabilities assumed in our acquisition of columbia natural resources  llc 
on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires tax benefits resulting from stock based compensation deductions in excess of amounts reported for financial reporting purposes to be reported as cash flows from financing activities 
in and  we reported a tax benefit from stock based compensation of million and million  respectively 
outstanding payments from certain disbursement accounts in excess of funded cash balances where no legal right of set off exists decreased by million  increased by million and increased by million in  and  respectively 
all disbursements are funded on the day they are presented to our bank using available cash on hand or draws on our revolving bank credit facility

index to financial statements bank credit and hedging facilities on november   we amended and restated our syndicated revolving bank credit facility to increase the borrowing base to billion with commitments of billion and extended the maturity to november we subsequently increased the commitments under the credit facility to billion 
as of december   we had billion in outstanding borrowings under this facility and had utilized approximately million of the facility for various letters of credit

the unused portion of the facility is subject to a commitment fee that also varies according to our senior unsecured long term debt ratings  from to per annum 
currently the commitment fee is per annum 
interest is payable quarterly or  if libor applies  it may be payable at more frequent intervals 
our subsidiaries  chesapeake exploration  llc and chesapeake appalachia  llc  are the borrowers under our revolving bank credit facility and chesapeake and all its other wholly owned subsidiaries except minor subsidiaries are guarantors 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
the credit facility agreement requires us to maintain an indebtedness to total capitalization ratio as defined not to exceed to and an indebtedness to ebitda ratio as defined not to exceed to as defined by the credit facility agreement  our indebtedness to total capitalization ratio was to and our indebtedness to ebitda ratio was to at december  if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such acceleration  if involving a principal amount of million million in the case of our senior notes issued after  would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures which could in turn result in the acceleration of a significant portion of our senior note indebtedness 
the credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
we have six secured hedging facilities  each of which permits us to enter into cash settled oil and natural gas commodity transactions  valued by the counterparty  for up to a maximum value 
outstanding transactions under each facility are collateralized by certain of our oil and natural gas properties that do not secure any of our other obligations 
the hedging facilities are subject to an annual exposure fee  which is assessed quarterly based on the average of the daily negative fair value amounts of the hedges  if any  during the quarter 
the hedging facilities contain the standard representations and default provisions that are typical of such agreements 
the agreements also contain various restrictive provisions which govern the aggregate oil and natural gas production volumes that we are permitted to hedge under all of our agreements at any one time

to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company s hedging program at its quarterly board meetings

although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged oil and natural gas production

the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the average rate from in to in is primarily the result of higher drilling costs  higher costs associated with acquisitions and the recognition of the tax effect of acquisition costs in excess of tax basis acquired in certain corporate acquisitions 
we expect the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe produced

index to financial statements depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the average d a rate per mcfe was  and in  and  respectively 
the increases in and were primarily the result of higher depreciation costs resulting from the acquisition of various gathering facilities  the construction of new buildings at our corporate headquarters complex and at various field office locations and additional information technology equipment and software 
in  increases were also attributed to the acquisition of compression equipment and drilling rigs 
the overall increase in was partially mitigated by various sale leaseback transactions throughout related to certain of our compressors and drilling rigs 
property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis 
buildings are depreciated over to years  gathering facilities are depreciated over years  drilling rigs are depreciated over years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from two to seven years 
to the extent company owned drilling rigs were used to drill our wells in and  a substantial portion of the rig depreciation was capitalized in oil and natural gas properties as exploration or development costs 
as a result of the sale leaseback of our company owned rigs  we did not recognize rig depreciation in we expect depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between and per mcfe produced

ward s resignation agreement provided for the immediate vesting of all of his unvested equity awards  which consisted of options to purchase  shares of chesapeake s common stock at an average exercise price of per share and  shares of restricted common stock 
as a result of this vesting  we incurred an expense of million in interest and other income 
interest and other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively

no such purchases or exchanges were completed in or income tax expense 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of million in compared to income tax expense of billion in and million in of the million decrease in  million was the result of the decrease in net income before taxes and million was the result of a decrease in the effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in compared to in and in our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the impact of state income taxes and permanent differences between our accounting for certain revenue or expense items and their corresponding treatment for income tax purposes

loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock 
loss on conversion exchange of preferred stock was million in compared to million in and million in the loss on the exchanges represented the excess of the fair value of the common stock issued over the fair value of the securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item for further detail regarding these transactions 
application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
hedging 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas  changes in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of oil and natural gas derivative transactions are reflected in oil and natural gas sales  and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and natural gas sales or interest expense 
cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the same category within the statement of cash flows as the items being hedged  or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately 
table of contents 
index to financial statements in oil and natural gas sales 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities above and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently confirmed the fair values internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of million  an asset of million and a liability of million  respectively 
the derivatives that we acquired in our cnr acquisition represented million  million and million of liability at december   and oil and natural gas properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and natural gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
under the full cost method  capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
in calculating future net revenues  current prices and costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts  including the effects of derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges 
two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
any excess of the net book value  less deferred income taxes  is generally written off as an expense 
under sec regulations  the excess above the ceiling is not expensed or is reduced if  subsequent to the end of the period  but prior to the release of the financial statements  oil and natural gas prices increase sufficiently such that an excess above the ceiling would have been eliminated or reduced if the increased prices were used in the calculations 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increase the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
as of december   approximately of our proved reserves were evaluated by independent petroleum engineers  with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers 
in addition  our internal engineers review and update our reserves on a quarterly basis 
all reserve estimates are prepared based upon a review of production histories and other geologic  economic  ownership and engineering data we developed 
additional information about our year end reserve evaluation is included under oil and natural gas reserves in item business 
in addition  the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period 
price changes directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues 
such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and 
table of contents 
index to financial statements amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if a natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  b exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or c we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of million 
fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 provides guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
guidance is also provided regarding de recognition  classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions 
based on this guidance  we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed under fin tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions 
we accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense 
penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses 
additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in income taxes item business 
accounting for business combinations 
our business has grown substantially through acquisitions and our business strategy is to continue to pursue acquisitions as opportunities arise 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas  accounting for business combinations 
the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at its purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
we believe that the consideration we have paid for our oil and natural gas property acquisitions has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of purchase 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our oil and natural gas property acquisitions  nor do we expect to recognize goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties as of december   we had accrued accounts receivable from our ceo  aubrey k 
mcclendon  of million representing joint interest billings from december which were invoiced and timely paid in january since chesapeake was founded in  mr 
mcclendon has acquired working interests in virtually all of our oil and natural gas properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of the founder well participation program fwpp described below 
joint interest billings to him are settled in cash immediately upon delivery of a monthly joint interest billing

mcclendon and our co founder and former coo  tom l 
ward  prior to august  may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf of chesapeake during a calendar year  but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake s board of directors not less than days prior to the start of each calendar year 
his participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the founder well participation program  which  among other things  limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake s working interest would be reduced below as a result of his participation 
in addition  the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by mr

this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  we are currently assessing the impact  if any  the adoption of this statement will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued its preliminary views on financial instruments with characteristics of equity as a step preceding the development of a proposed statement of financial accounting standards 
such a standard would affect accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlements 
this accounting could increase the amount of interest expense required to be recognized with respect to such instruments and  thus  lower reported net income and net income per share of issuers of such instruments 
issuers would have to account for the liability and equity components of the instrument separately and in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt 
we have two debt series that would be affected by such a standard  our contingent convertible senior notes due and our contingent convertible senior notes due if the fasb adopts the statement  it is expected to be effective for fiscal years starting after december  companies would have to apply the statement retrospectively to both existing and new instruments that fall within the scope of the guidance

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk oil and natural gas hedging activities our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and natural gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our oil and natural gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  basis protection swaps  knockout swaps  cap swaps  call options and collars 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective oil and natural gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
for swap instruments  chesapeake receives a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pays a floating market price to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential for oil or natural gas from a specified delivery point 
for mid continent basis protection swaps  which have negative differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
for appalachian basin basis protection swaps  which have positive differentials to nymex  chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract 
for knockout swaps  chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for the possibility to reduce the counterparty s exposure to zero  in any given month  if the floating market price is lower than certain pre determined knockout prices 
for cap swaps  chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterparty s exposure 
in other words  there is no limit to chesapeake s exposure but there is a limit to the downside exposure of the counterparty 
for call options  chesapeake receives a premium from the counterparty in exchange for the sale of a call option 
if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess 
if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call option  no payment is due from chesapeake 
collars contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  chesapeake receives the fixed price and pays the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
chesapeake enters into counter swaps from time to time for the purpose of locking in the value of a swap 
under the counter swap  chesapeake receives a floating price for the hedged commodity and pays a fixed price to the counterparty 
the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of a swap since subsequent changes in the market value of the swap are entirely offset by subsequent changes in the market value of the counter swap 
we refer to this locked in value as a locked swap 
generally  at the time chesapeake enters into a counter swap  chesapeake removes the original swap s designation as a cash flow hedge and classifies the original swap as a non qualifying hedge under sfas the reason for this new designation is that collectively the swap and the counter swap no longer hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows 
instead  the swap and counter swap effectively lock in a specific gain or loss that will be unaffected by subsequent variability in oil and natural gas prices 
any locked in gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified to oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production 
with respect to counter swaps that are designed to lock in the value of cap swaps  the counter swap is effective in locking in the value of the cap swap until the floating price reaches the cap or floor stipulated in the cap swap agreement 
the value of the counter swap will increase or decrease  but in the opposite direction  as the value of the cap swap decreases or increases until the floating price reaches the pre determined cap or floor stipulated in the cap swap agreement 
however  because of the written put option embedded in the cap swap  the changes in value of the cap swap are not completely effective in offsetting changes in value of the corresponding counter swap 
changes in the value of cap swaps and counter swaps are recorded as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 to the extent that a legal right of set off exists  chesapeake nets the value of its derivative arrangements with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
gains or losses from certain derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to oil and natural gas sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains losses are included in oil and natural gas sales in the month of related production 
pursuant to sfas  certain derivatives do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
changes in the fair value of these non qualifying derivatives that occur prior to their maturity ie  temporary fluctuations in value are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains losses within oil and natural gas sales 
following provisions of sfas  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized currently in oil and natural gas sales as unrealized gains losses

for amounts originally recorded in other comprehensive income  the gain will be recognized in oil and natural gas sales in the month of the hedged production 
we assumed certain liabilities related to open derivative positions in connection with our acquisition of columbia natural resources  llc in november in accordance with sfas  these derivative positions were recorded at fair value in the purchase price allocation as a liability of million 
the recognition of the derivative liability and other assumed liabilities resulted in an increase in the total purchase price which was allocated to the assets acquired 
because of this accounting treatment  only cash settlements for changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisition date for the derivative positions assumed result in adjustments to our oil and natural gas revenues upon settlement 
for example  if the fair value of the derivative positions assumed does not change  then upon the sale of the underlying production and corresponding settlement of the derivative positions  cash would be paid to the counterparties and there would be no adjustment to oil and natural gas revenues related to the derivative positions 
if  however  the actual sales price is different from the price assumed in the original fair value calculation  the difference would be reflected as either a decrease or increase in oil and natural gas revenues  depending upon whether the sales price was higher or lower  respectively  than the prices assumed in the original fair value calculation 
for accounting purposes  the net effect of these acquired hedges is that we hedged the production volumes at market prices on the date of our acquisition of cnr
