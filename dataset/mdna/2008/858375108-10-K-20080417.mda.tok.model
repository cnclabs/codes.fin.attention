item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview stein mart s stores offer the fashion merchandise  service and presentation of a better department or specialty store at prices competitive with off price retail chains 
our focused assortment of merchandise features current season moderate to better fashion apparel for women and men  as well as accessories  gifts  linens and shoes 
management believes that stein mart differentiates itself from typical off price retailers by offering i primarily current season merchandise carried by better department and specialty stores  ii at moderate to better price levels  iii a stronger merchandising statement  consistently offering more depth of color and size in individual stock keeping units  and iv merchandise presentation and customer service more comparable to other upscale retailers 
the company faces competition for customers and for access to quality merchandise from department and specialty stores and  to a lesser degree  from off price retail chains 
many of these competitors are units of large national or regional chains that have substantially greater resources than the company 
the retail apparel industry is highly fragmented and competitive  and the off price retail business may become even more competitive in the future 
fiscal year included weeks and included weeks 
the rd week in resulted in a one week difference between stein mart s fiscal reporting and comparable store sales reporting periods 
net sales decreased percent for the week year ended february  compared to the week year ended february  excluding the extra week for last year  sales decreased percent 
comparable store sales decreased percent compared to the same week period ended february  gross profit decreased to million or percent of sales in from million or percent of sales in the gross profit rate decreased primarily due to increased markdowns and occupancy costs  slightly offset by improved markup 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were higher in total dollars and as a percentage of sales in due to a lack of leverage on decreased sales and increases in advertising  depreciation and costs associated with the transition of the president chief executive officer 
these factors contributed to an loss per diluted share in we experienced a significant decline in sales during the fall season  and were only able to ease that trend when we offered dramatic discounts  including a return to coupons off regular price merchandise 
we accelerated our traditional red dot clearance event  which began the day after christmas  in order to move fall and winter merchandise 
even with our aggressive posture on markdowns our comparable store sales declined more than six percent in the fall season 
on a positive note  we were able to manage inventory levels and decreased inventories percent on an average store basis at year end 
the fall season was the most difficult for our home area gifts and linens with a percent decrease in comparable store sales  following a seven percent decrease in the spring season 
geographically  the florida market and in some cases  the greater southeast also weighed negatively on our performance 
the florida market  where we have percent of our stores  continued its disproportionate contribution to our comparable store sales decline 
because of these stores traditional strength  their poor performance is weighing more heavily on our bottom line 
outlook we are examining all aspects of our business to identify ways to succeed in the current difficult retail environment 
during we will be focusing on the following initiatives to improve performance merchandising we are working to keep our overall inventories down 
we are seeking out the more opportunistic purchases in fashion apparel  and will be pursuing them more vigorously than we have in recent years 
we are expanding our assortment of brand name merchandise 
we are looking to intensify our accessory area by testing self service jewelry displays as opposed to attended counter displays  testing fragrances in limited doors  as well as adding square footage to this core area of the store 
we are experimenting with restoring certain highly focused elements of children s clothing in stores where we believe its absence may have contributed to traffic declines 
we are refocusing our home area to be more promotional and giftable 
we have intensified our focus on a subset of our ladies business that we think has strong growth possibilities a more fashion conscious customer who has a younger attitude but prefers a missy fit

the million increase in other income is the result of a million settlement received from the visa check master money anti trust litigation and the revenue from our new credit card program 
the company earned net interest income of million on its cash and short term investments during compared to million during the decrease in net interest income is due to decreased short term investments  primarily as a result of paying dividends of million during  capital expenditures of million in and borrowing under the revolving line of credit agreement during the second half of liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventories 
capital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds  a revolving credit facility and credit terms from vendors 
working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  the company s working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest in either the third or fourth quarter in anticipation of the fourth quarter peak selling season 
as of february   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in operating cash flows for decreased million from due to a million decrease in cash provided by net income loss plus non cash charges  a million increase in cash used for income taxes receivable payable and a million increase in cash used for other working capital accounts excluding inventory

operating cash flows for decreased million from due to a million decrease in cash provided by net income plus non cash charges and a million increase in cash used to acquire inventories  offset by a million increase in cash provided by other working capital accounts 
we were building inventory levels during the second half of to support a revamped home area  the expanded intimate  special size and casual categories  nine new fall stores  and a better transition in our resort stores 
a sales shortfall during the holiday selling season resulted in higher inventory levels 
net cash used in provided by investing activities was million in  million in and million in the net liquidation of short term investments provided million and million of cash in and  respectively  compared to net purchases of short term investments using million cash in capital expenditures were higher in and due primarily to remodeling costs for existing stores and the roll out of new point of sale equipment and software 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in dividends paid were highest in due to a special dividend of per share totaling million 
the company expects to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in the cost of opening a typical new store generally ranges from  to  for fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and pre opening costs primarily advertising  stocking and training 
pre opening costs are expensed at the time of opening 
initial inventory investment for a new store is approximately  the company has a million senior revolving secured credit agreement the agreement with a group of lenders which extends through january under the terms of the agreement  the company has the option to increase the facility by an additional million 
borrowings are based on and collateralized primarily by eligible inventory 
the company had million in borrowings and million of outstanding standby letters of credit at february  approximately million was available under the agreement and no event of default existed under the terms of the agreement at february  the company believes that expected net cash provided by operating activities and unused borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement will be sufficient to fund anticipated current and long term capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
should current operating conditions deteriorate  management can borrow on the revolving credit agreement or adjust operating plans  including new store rollout 

table of contents contractual obligations to facilitate an understanding of the company s contractual obligations  the following payments due by period data is provided in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases at february   the company had million in direct borrowings under its credit facility 
other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits february  only  deferred income taxes  deferred compensation  deferred rent liability and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments total million and are included in the above table 
due to the variable interest rates in our outstanding senior revolving credit agreement  we are unable to accurately estimate our future annual interest payments 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at february  if certain conditions were to occur under these arrangements  the company would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  the company does not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect the financial condition of the company 
seasonality the company s business is seasonal in nature with a higher percentage of the company s merchandise sales and earnings generated in the fall and holiday selling seasons 
accordingly  sg a expenses are typically higher as a percent of net sales during the first three quarters of each year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while the company believes that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that its estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require the company to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
following is a summary of the more significant accounting policies retail inventory method and inventory valuation 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or market  on a first in first out basis  using the retail inventory method rim 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry 
the use of rim results in inventories being valued at the lower of cost or market as markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail values of inventories 
based on a review of historical markdowns  current business trends and seasonal inventory categories  additional inventory reserves may be recorded to reflect estimated markdowns which may be required to liquidate certain inventories and reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market 
management believes its inventory valuation methods approximate the net realizable value of clearance inventory and result in valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market 
included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories is a reserve for shrinkage 
shrinkage is estimated based on historical physical inventory results as a percentage of sales for the year 
the difference between actual and estimated amounts may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
vendor allowances 
the company receives allowances from some of its vendors primarily related to markdown reimbursement  damaged defective merchandise and vendor compliance issues 
vendor allowances are recorded when earned 
allowances received from vendors related to profitability of inventory recently sold are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold in the later of the period that the merchandise markdown is incurred or the allowance is negotiated 
allowances received from vendors 
table of contents related to damaged defective inventory are reflected as reductions to the cost of merchandise as it is received 
allowances received due to compliance issues primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise when negotiated 
although it is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support  if a reduction were to occur  the company could experience higher cost of merchandise sold 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets 
impairment reviews are performed for individual stores 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and future cash flows 
a significant change in cash flows or estimated market values could result in an increase in asset impairment charges 
during  we recorded million in pre tax asset impairment charges related to closed and under performing stores 
store closing costs 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  to record store closing costs 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
lease termination costs are recorded net of estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the properties 
in the event the company is not successful in subleasing closed store locations  additional store closing costs may be recorded 
insurance reserves 
the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits  a portion of which is paid by the covered employees 
the company is responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are estimated actuarially  based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
as of february  and february   insurance reserves of million and million  respectively  were included in accrued liabilities 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in trends and other actuarial assumptions have not been significant in  or income tax reserves 
the company records liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to federal and state income taxes 
these liabilities reflect the company s best estimate of its ultimate income tax liability based on the tax code  regulations  and pronouncements of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
estimating our ultimate tax liability involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions 
if the company s actual results differ from estimated results  the company s effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change
