risk factors 
overview corporate highlights forodesine hcl following the completion of a phase i ii clinical trial of forodesine hcl in patients with refractory ctcl  in october we initiated a planned pivotal trial with an oral formulation of forodesine hcl for treatment of patients with ctcl 
this trial is being conducted under an spa agreement negotiated with the fda and will serve as a basis for a new drug application to the fda using the oral formulations in patients with relapsed ctcl 
in february  we announced that the committee for orphan medicinal products of the european medicines agency had granted orphan drug designation to forodesine hcl for the treatment of ctcl 
at the december meeting of the american society of hematology ash madeline duvic  md  deputy chair  dermatology  the university of texas md anderson cancer center presented interim data from the phase i ii clinical study of oral forodesine hcl in the treatment of subjects with refractory ctcl 
the overall response rate for these subjects was  including subjects with complete response and subjects with partial response 
these data indicated that in addition to a good safety profile  forodesine hcl demonstrated clinical activity as a single oral agent in patients with advanced refractory ctcl 
in january  we initiated a phase iib multicenter  open label  non randomized repeat dose registration study to evaluate an intravenous treatment of forodesine hcl followed by an oral treatment of forodesine hcl in patients with relapsed or refractory t all 
this study was being conducted under an spa negotiated with the fda and was designed to determine the rate of complete remission achieved with forodesine hcl 
in march  we announced that as a result of a stability issue with the iv formulation  that we were voluntarily placing this phase iib clinical trial on hold pending internal review and discussions with the our partner  mundipharma 
in december  we announced the formal termination of this study 
peramivir in january  we announced that hhs had awarded the company a million  four year contract for the advanced development of peramivir 
in january  we announced the development cost of our peramivir program to product approval would cost in excess of the million contract since the development plan for peramivir has changed from that outlined in the original proposal to hhs 
hhs has indicated that it will fund certain elements of our revised program  including the ongoing phase ii iv study evaluating peramivir in hospitalized subjects  the planning and conduct of the planned phase ii study of im peramivir in subjects with uncomplicated influenza and the manufacturing and toxicology components of the program 
each of these elements has specific hhs funding limits and any costs outside the approved amounts by hhs may be the responsibility of the company 
the original contract of million and the four year term remain unchanged 

table of contents in addition to the contract with hhs  in february  we established a collaborative relationship with shionogi for the development and commercialization of peramivir in japan 
this agreement resulted in an upfront payment of million 
in december  we received a milestone payment from shionogi for their initiation of a phase ii clinical trial with iv peramivir 
intramuscular peramivir in september  we announced the results of our phase ii study with im peramivir injection 
the study was a randomized  double blind placebo controlled clinical trial designed to test whether peramivir  when administered acutely in high doses intramuscularly  could reduce the duration of symptoms during seasonal influenza 
during the study  patients who had a positive rapid antigen test indicating influenza were randomized to receive im injections of either placebo or one of two dose levels of peramivir mg and mg as a single dose administered within hours of symptom onset 
the primary endpoint of the study was the time to alleviation of symptoms in the patients confirmed with influenza infection  of which there were the results indicated that in the subjects  a single dose of peramivir demonstrated a treatment improvement over placebo  but the improvement was not statistically significant 
following the release of these results  we completed additional analysis of the clinical data and performed a preliminary analysis of the virologic data from this trial 
we also conducted further pharmacokinetic pk studies in healthy volunteers 
preliminary analysis of the virologic data from this phase ii im trial indicated that im peramivir demonstrated statistically significant reductions in influenza virus shedding in both active treatment groups when compared to placebo  with greater reductions in the mg group 
additionally  pk studies have been completed  which indicate that needle length impacts adequate and consistent systemic exposure to im peramivir 
based on these clinical results and virologic data  we believe that a single im dose of mg peramivir can be a potentially clinically effective dose 
however  given the dose response observed between the mg and mg doses in the phase ii trial  we believe it is prudent to evaluate whether doses higher than mg provide additional efficacy 
as a result  we are planning to initiate a phase ii clinical trial that will evaluate the mg dose and a higher dose of peramivir later this year 
in january  we announced that we would not continue to pursue the peramivir im phase iii pivotal program in the current flu season and would work toward the initiation of a phase ii clinical trial later this year that would evaluate a mg dose and a higher dose of peramivir compared to placebo 
the decision to terminate the phase iii program was made by us after further evaluation of the phase ii study data  additional pk studies  the potential availability of an alternative formulation and additional discussions with fda and hhs 
at the time of termination of the program we had enrolled subjects in the northern hemisphere 
we plan to gather and analyze the data from these enrolled subjects to assist in the design of future studies 
intravenous peramivir in july  we announced the initiation of a phase ii clinical trial of iv peramivir to compare the efficacy and safety of iv peramivir to orally administered oseltamivir in patients who require hospitalization due to acute influenza 
this trial was initiated in the southern hemisphere and is currently ongoing in the northern hemisphere 
bcx r during the third quarter of  we announced that roche had initiated a phase iia clinical trial to evaluate oral doses of bcx r in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis 
other corporate events completion of million financing in august  we completed a million private placement financing with a group of existing stock holders 
the offering was composed of approximately million shares of our common stock  as well as warrants to purchase an additional approximately million shares 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue was million for the year compared to million for the increase for was primarily due to revenue from hhs related to our contract for the development of peramivir 
in addition  we received a million milestone payment from shionogi in december for their initiation of a phase ii clinical trial and there was an increase of million in amortization of deferred revenue compared to on the continuing amortization of the upfront payments from the roche  shionogi and mundipharma agreements 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease of million in reimbursement from mundipharma for our clinical trial costs compared to 
table of contents research and development expenses for were million  a increase from expenses of million  primarily attributable to the clinical and manufacturing costs of our expanded peramivir and forodesine hcl programs  increases in personnel and related costs to support the advanced development of our pipeline  and increases in consulting and toxicology 
included in r d expenses for is approximately million of pre contract costs directly related to the phase trials for both the iv and iv peramivir products 
these costs were incurred during in anticipation of a contract award from hhs and were required to meet the delivery schedule of the proposed contract 
in accordance with the provisions of federal acquisition regulation  the costs were included in the company s request for proposal and were eligible for reimbursement from hhs 
the million of costs incurred prior to the contract award date were deferred and included in other current assets on the company s balance sheet at december  in the first quarter of  the million in costs were billed and expensed 
concurrently  revenue was recognized for these costs plus the applicable fixed fee general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of over the expense of million  primarily due to additional compensation  which also included an increase of million non cash share based compensation charge related to statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement no

general and administrative expenses for were million  an increase of over the expense of million  primarily due to the million non cash share based compensation charge related to statement no 
r  an increase in professional fees  and an increase in personnel related expenses 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in costs allocated to research and development 
interest income for was million  a increase compared to million in this increase was due to a higher average cash balance during and a more favorable interest rate environment as compared to the net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share in changes in financial condition since december  since our most recent fiscal year end  there have been several factors that have had an impact on our financial condition 
effective in january  we received the contract from hhs for the development of peramivir which has had a significant impact on our financial condition 
our combined billed and unbilled receivables related to this contract as of december   were approximately million 
as our costs for the development of 
table of contents peramivir and our other programs have increased  we have also had a corresponding increase in our payables and accrued expenses 
with the payments received from our collaborative agreements existing at december   our contract with hhs and the addition of the shionogi collaboration announced in march  we have received approximately million during the million upfront payment from shionogi in march has been deferred  which has been the major cause of the increase in deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
lastly  with the private placement announced in august  our cash and stockholder s equity increased by million related to this transaction 
liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since our inception 
our operations have principally been funded through public offerings and private placements of equity and debt securities and cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements  including government contracts  and to a lesser extent interest 
for example  during  we received cash from collaborative and other research and development agreements and government contracts primarily shionogi  mundipharma and hhs of approximately million and on august  we announced the closing of a million private placement of common stock to certain existing stockholders  which increased our outstanding common stock by approximately million shares and our fully diluted outstanding shares by an additional approximately million shares pursuant to warrants exercisable at per share 
as of december   we have approximately million due from our collaborators  primarily hhs 
other sources of funding have included the following other collaborative and other research and development agreements  government grants and contracts  equipment lease financing  facility leases  research grants  and interest income 
in addition  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities  undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of compounds which have been or may be discovered and as we increase the manufacturing of our compounds for clinical trials and for the continuation of the validation process 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims and additional regulatory costs as our clinical products advance through later stages of development 
we invest our excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
these investments are generally not collateralized and mature within two years 
we have not realized any losses from such investments 
on august   we amended our lease for our current birmingham facilities  consisting of  square feet  through june  we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five years at the current market rate in effect on june  the lease requires us to pay monthly rent currently at  per month in july and escalating annually to a minimum of  per month in the final year  plus our pro rata share of 
table of contents operating expenses and real estate taxes in excess of base year amounts 
in addition  the lease amendment provides an allowance of  for our use in making certain improvements to the premises 
in august  we opened an office in cary  north carolina for the establishment of our clinical and regulatory operation 
we currently have  square feet under lease through february  this lease requires us to pay  per month and escalates annually to  per month in the final year 
during  we incurred capital costs of approximately million 
included in capital costs were amounts related to a renovation of our facility to build additional laboratory space 
the cost of this expansion will be partially funded by a  tenant allowance in our lease amendment 
at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of  in   in and  in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facilities 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following payments under our contract with hhs  our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  and lease or loan financing and future public or private financing 
in march  we announced a collaborative agreement with shionogi for rights to peramivir in japan 
this agreement required an upfront payment of million that was received in april in december  we received a million milestone payment from shionogi for their initiation of a phase ii clinical trial with iv peramivir 
in january  we announced that hhs had awarded the company a million  four year contract for the advanced development of peramivir 
the contract is a standard cost plus fixed fee contract  which we expect will continue to have a significant positive impact on our financial position and cash flow 
we bill our incurred costs to hhs on a monthly basis 
any significant delays in payment  rejection of significant costs by hhs or cancellation of this contract by hhs would have a significant negative effect on our financial position 
in january  we announced that the development costs of our peramivir program to anticipated product approval would cost in excess of the million contract since the development plan for peramivir had changed from that outlined in the original proposal to hhs 
hhs has indicated that they will fund certain elements of our revised program  including the ongoing phase ii iv study evaluating peramivir in hospitalized subjects  the planning and conduct of the planned phase ii study of im peramivir and the manufacturing and toxicology components of the program 
each of these elements has specific hhs funding limits and any costs outside the approved amounts by hhs may be the responsibility of the company 
the original contract of million and the four year term remain unchanged 
in february  we licensed forodesine hcl to mundipharma for the development and commercialization of this drug in europe  asia and australasia 
in addition to the upfront payment of million  which was received in february  mundipharma is paying of the clinical development costs we are incurring for forodesine hcl on existing and planned clinical trials  but their portion shall not exceed million 
in addition  mundipharma will conduct additional clinical trials at their own cost up to a maximum of million 
the agreement also provides for future event payments and royalties to be made by mundipharma upon the achievement of certain clinical  regulatory and sales events 
in january  we initiated our pivotal study with forodesine hcl in t cell leukemia patients under an spa negotiated with the fda  which triggered a million event payment from mundipharma 
subsequently  in march  the company made a decision to put this trial on voluntary hold to investigate particulates that were found in some batches of iv formulation 
in december  we announced the termination of our development in t all with forodesine hcl 
in july  we 
table of contents announced the company had received an spa for a pivotal trial of forodesine hcl in ctcl patients 
the trial is a multicenter  multinational  open label  single arm  repeat dose pivotal trial which began enrollment during october the collaboration with roche for the worldwide development and commercialization of bcx in november provided an upfront payment of million  which was received in roche has taken over the development and is paying all costs associated with this program 
the agreement also provides for future event payments and royalties to be made by roche upon the achievement of certain clinical  regulatory and sales events 
for the year  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance has increased from million as of december  to million as of december   primarily due to cash received from collaborations and the million received from the private placement of common stock and warrants in august  which were offset by the monthly cash burn from operations 
as a result of these items and the reimbursement from our contract with hhs  our net cash burn rate for was approximately million per month 
we caution that our revenues  our expenses and our cash flows will vary significantly from quarter to quarter throughout due to the nature of the trials in influenza and the reimbursement from hhs 
we are projecting our net cash use to be million  partially due to the reduction of our receivable balance from hhs at december  this burn rate could vary significantly depending on the timing of company expenses and the related reimbursement from hhs 
as our clinical programs continue to progress and patient enrollment increases  our costs will increase 
our current and planned clinical trials plus the related development  manufacturing  regulatory approval process requirements and additional personnel resources and testing required for the continuing development of our drug candidates will consume significant capital resources and will increase our expenses 
our expenses  revenues and burn rate could vary significantly depending on many factors  including our ability to raise additional capital  the development progress of our collaborative agreements for our drug candidates  the amount and timing of funding we receive from hhs for peramivir  the amount of funding or assistance  if any  we receive from other governmental agencies or other new partnerships with third parties for the development of our drug candidates  the progress and results of our current and proposed clinical trials for our most advanced drug products  the progress made in the manufacturing of our lead products and the progression of our other programs 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which included the million from the private placement of unregistered common stock and warrants to certain existing stockholders  which closed on august  with our currently available funds and the amounts to be received from hhs  shionogi and our other collaborators  we believe these resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  this is a forward looking statement  and there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including our ability to perform under the contract with hhs and receive reimbursement  the progress and magnitude of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships or government contracts  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships with academic institutions  biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies and governmental agencies or other third parties  the extent to which our partners  including governmental agencies will share in the costs associated with the development of our programs or run the development programs themselves  our ability to negotiate favorable development and marketing strategic alliances for certain drug candidates  or a decision to build or expand internal development and commercial capabilities  
table of contents successful commercialization of marketed products by either us or a partner  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify and evaluate drug candidates  our ability to engage sites and enroll subjects in our clinical trials  the scope of manufacturing of our drug candidates to support our preclinical research and clinical trials  increases in personnel and related costs to support the development of our drug candidates  the scope of manufacturing of our drug substance and drug products required for future nda filings  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  and the costs involved in all aspects of intellectual property strategy and protection including the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims 
we expect that we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of our current product candidates 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  including governmental agencies in general and from the hhs contract specifically  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe or off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations in the table below  we set forth our enforceable and legally binding obligations and future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  some of the amounts we include in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including their duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties  and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the obligations we will actually pay in future periods may vary from those reflected in the table 
payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on biocryst s balance sheet under gaap total 
table of contents purchase obligations include commitments related to clinical development  manufacturing and research operations and other significant purchase commitments 
included above are certain contractual obligations that existed at december  that were subsequently cancelled during the total amount of these obligations outstanding at december  was approximately million 
we are in the process of negotiating final payments for services performed under these contracts 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future sublicense payments to third parties as part of in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our balance sheet 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which were utilized in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues have generally been limited to license fees  event payments  research and development fees  government contracts  and interest income 
revenue is recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf issue 
license fees  event payments  and research and development fees are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete and we have no further continuing performance obligations or we have completed the performance obligations under the terms of the agreement 
fees received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as earned over an estimated period determined by management based on the terms of the agreement and the products licensed 
for example  in the roche and mundipharma licenses agreements  we deferred the upfront payments over the remaining life of the patents which are and  respectively 
in the event a license agreement contains multiple deliverables  we evaluate whether the deliverables are separate or combined units of accounting in accordance with eitf issue revisions to revenue or profit estimates as a result of changes in the estimated revenue period are recognized prospectively 
under the guidance of eitf emerging issues task force issue  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent and emerging issues task force issue  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses  reimbursements received for direct out of pocket expenses related to research and development costs are recorded as revenue in the income statement rather than as a reduction in expenses 
for example  the amounts received from our collaboration with mundipharma for the reimbursement of clinical trial costs and the costs received from hhs for reimbursement will be recorded as revenue in the period the related costs were recorded 
event payments are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of specified events if the event is substantive in nature and the achievement of the event was not reasonably assured at the inception of the 
table of contents agreement and the fees are non refundable and non creditable 
any event payments received prior to satisfying these criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
royalty revenue is recognized based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjusted for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
if royalties can not be reasonably estimated  revenue is recognized upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensee 
we have not received any royalties from the sale of licensed pharmaceutical products 
research and development expenses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for research and development costs  we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses include  among other items  personnel costs  including salaries and benefits  manufacturing costs  clinical  regulatory  and toxicology services performed by contract research organizations cro s  materials and supplies  and overhead allocations consisting of various administrative and facilities related costs 
most of our manufacturing and clinical and preclinical studies are performed by third party cro s 
costs for studies performed by cro s are accrued by us over the service periods specified in the contracts and estimates are adjusted  if required  based upon ours on going review of the level of services actually performed 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
additionally  we have license agreements with third parties  such as aecom  irl  and uab  which require maintenance fees or fees related to sublicense agreements 
these fees are generally expensed as incurred unless they are related to revenues that have been deferred  in which case the expenses are deferred and recognized over the related revenue recognition period 
we group our r d expenses into two major categories direct external expenses and all other r d expenses 
direct external expenses consist of costs of outside parties to conduct laboratory studies  to develop manufacturing processes and manufacture the product candidate  to conduct and manage clinical trials and similar costs related to our clinical and preclinical studies 
these costs are accumulated and tracked by program 
all other r d expenses consist of costs to compensate personnel  to purchase lab supplies and services  to maintain our facility  equipment and overhead and similar costs of our research and development efforts 
these costs apply to work on our clinical and preclinical candidates as well as our discovery research efforts 
these costs have not been charged directly to each program historically because the number of product candidates and projects in research and development may vary from period to period and because we utilize internal resources across multiple projects at the same time 

table of contents the following table summarizes our r d expenses for the periods indicated year ended december  direct external r d expenses by program pnp inhibitor forodesine hcl pnp inhibitor bcx neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir hepatitis c polymerase inhibitor other all other r d expenses compensation and fringe benefits supplies and services maintenance  depreciation  and amortization overhead allocation and other total r d expenses at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the stages of our various product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our drug candidates for potential commercialization 
while we are currently focused on advancing each of our development programs  our future r d expenses will depend on the determinations we make as to the scientific and clinical success of each drug candidate  as well as ongoing assessments as to each drug candidate s commercial potential 
as such  we are unable to predict how we will allocate available resources among our product development programs in the future 
in addition  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty the development progress of our existing partnerships for our drug candidates  which drug candidates will be subject to future collaborations  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
the successful development of our drug candidates is uncertain and subject to a number of risks 
we cannot be certain that any of our drug candidates will prove to be safe and effective or will meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive and maintain marketing approval 
data from preclinical studies and clinical trials are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory clearance 
we  the fda  or other regulatory authorities may suspend clinical trials at any time if we or they believe that the subjects participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable risks or if such regulatory agencies find deficiencies in the conduct of the trials or other problems with our products under development 
delays or rejections may be encountered based on additional governmental regulation  legislation  administrative action or changes in fda or other regulatory policy during development or the review process 
other risks associated with our product development programs are described in risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report on form k  as updated from time to time in our subsequent periodic reports and current reports filed with the sec 
due to these uncertainties  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring a product to market  the timing of completion of any of our product development programs and the period in which material net cash inflows from any of our product development programs will commence are unavailable 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances 
table of contents known to us 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical and toxicology studies and clinical trials  fees paid to investigative sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of our raw materials  drug substance and drug products  and professional service fees 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
to date  there have been no material changes to our estimates 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation at december   we have two stock based employee compensation plans  the stock incentive plan and the employee stock purchase plan 
prior to january   we accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and other related interpretations  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement no 

no stock based compensation cost related to our employees was recognized in the statements of operations for any period ending prior to january   as all options granted to our employees had exercise prices equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
under the fair value recognition provisions of statement no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
consistent with the valuation method we used for disclosure only purposes under the provisions of statement no 
 we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value under statement no 
r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and the related assumptions for the model requires judgment  including estimating the life of an award  the stock price volatility  and the expected term 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the 
table of contents principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our expected cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we believe we have no material exposure to market risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided
