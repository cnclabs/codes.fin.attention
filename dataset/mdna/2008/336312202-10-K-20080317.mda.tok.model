item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes included in this annual report on form k 
the discussion in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations  and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this annual report on form k should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this annual report on form k 
year ended december  the following discussion and analysis sets forth the major factors that affected first security s financial condition as of december  and  and results of operations for the three years ended december  as reflected in the audited financial statements 
overview as of december   we had total consolidated assets of approximately billion  total loans of approximately million  total deposits of approximately million and stockholders equity of approximately million

as of december   we had total consolidated assets of approximately billion  total loans of approximately million  total deposits of approximately million and stockholders equity of approximately million 
in  our net income was million  resulting in basic and diluted net income of and per share  respectively 
net interest income and non interest income for increased by thousand and thousand respectively  while non interest expense  including provision for loan losses  increased by million as compared to excluding the other than temporary impairment in and the available for sale securities losses in and  non interest income increased million 
income increases outpaced expense increases as a result of the change in the mix of earning assets towards loans  as well as the growing diversified stream of non interest income from trust services  fees on deposit accounts and mortgage banking activity 
the increase in expenses is mainly due to higher salaries and benefits associated with the average full time equivalent employees increasing by twelve to for due to opening two new branches and a loan production office 
we maintained our efficiency ratio in relative to at versus  which reflects a sustained improvement from in excluding the securities impairment charge and losses on sales of securities  we have improved our efficiency ratio each year in  in and in the efficiency ratio for was impacted by the opening of our new corporate headquarters in december  the opening of de novo branches in cleveland and cookeville  tennessee in april and may  respectively  as well as a loan production office in marietta  georgia in april we expect to continue achieving further efficiencies by growing our operating revenue faster than our expenses 
in the future  we plan to identify additional locations in knoxville  chattanooga  and cleveland  tennessee  as well as locations for expansion into the north metro atlanta  georgia and metro nashville  tennessee markets 
at this time  we have a written option to purchase land for a future de novo branch in hixson chattanooga  tennessee 
while we will be opportunistic  we are mindful of the additional expense associated with de novo branches 
net interest margin in was or basis points lower as compared to the prior period of 
the net interest margin of our peer group as reported on the december  uniform bank performance report was and for and  respectively 
as expected  our margin declined due to the higher cost of deposits associated with a greater reliance on certificates of deposits and other borrowings

index to financial statements additionally  the easing of the target federal funds target rate by the federal reserve board reduced our yield on earning assets during the third and fourth quarters of through january   the federal reserve board has reduced the target federal funds target rate by basis points in a five month period 
further rate cuts are currently expected in we anticipate our margin to decrease between and basis points in the first quarter of from the margin for the fourth quarter of the margin for the remainder of will be dependant on our ability to raise core deposits  our growth rate in loans  and any possible further actions by the federal reserve board 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
critical accounting policies include the initial adoption of an accounting policy that has a material impact on our financial presentation as well as accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements that require us to make estimates and assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time 
disclosure about critical estimates is required if different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses and the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets each represent a critical accounting estimate 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is established and maintained at levels management deems adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the level is based on past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  underlying estimated values of collateral securing loans  current economic conditions and other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate of credit losses in the loan portfolio and the related allowance would also change 
refer to the provision for loan and lease losses section for a discussion of our methodology of establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses 
we periodically review the carrying values of intangible assets not subject to amortization  including goodwill  to determine whether an impairment exists 
statement of financial standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  prescribes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition 
these assets are subject to at least an annual impairment review and more frequently if certain impairment indicators are in evidence 
changes in the estimates and assumptions used to evaluate impairment may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
results of operations we reported net income for of million versus net income for of million and net income for of million after the recognition of extraordinary gain of million 
in  basic net income per share was on approximately million shares and diluted net income per share was on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding 
in  basic net income per share was on approximately million shares and diluted net income per share was on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding 
in  basic net income per share was on approximately million shares and diluted net income per share was on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding 
net income in was above the level as a result of our organic loan growth and growing fee income  partially offset by a decreasing net interest margin 
our overhead also increased in because of our new corporate headquarters  which opened in december and our two new de novo branches  which opened in april and may  and additional full time equivalent employees 
as of december   we had banking offices  including the headquarters  five leasing offices and full time equivalent employees

index to financial statements although we expect to continue to expand our branch network and our employee force in  we are mindful of the fact that growth and increasing the number of branches adds expenses such as administrative costs and occupancy  salaries and benefits expenses before earnings

net interest income net interest income the difference between the interest earned on assets  such as loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings is our primary source of operating income 
in  net interest income was million or more than the level of million  which in turn was more than the level of million 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume of interest earning assets and the various rate spreads between our interest earning assets and our funding sources 
changes in net interest income from period to period result from increases or decreases in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  increases or decreases in the average interest rates earned and paid on such assets and liabilities  the ability to manage the interest earning asset portfolio which includes loans  and the availability of particular sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits 

table of contents 
index to financial statements interest income in was million  an increase over the level of million  which was a increase over the level of million 
year to year increases since are due to the annual increases in the volume of earning assets and a shift in the earning asset mix from investment securities and federal funds sold to our higher yielding loan portfolio 
average loans in were million  an increase of million or over all other earning assets were million  a decrease of million or 
total average earning assets in were billion  an increase of million or from average earning assets 
we decreased our securities portfolio by electing to shift a portion of the recurring cash flow from interest  principal paydowns and maturities  as well as transferring the proceeds from securities sales  into the loan portfolio 
our increase in loans year over year in was made feasible by the deposit gathering activities at fsgbank  the use of alternative funding through overnight advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb and the shifting mix of earning assets 
these additional earning assets in have enabled us to earn more interest income 
supplementing the additional earnings from increased volumes was the increases in yield on earning assets 
the tax equivalent yield on earning assets increased basis points in to from in  which was basis points higher than the changes in the yield rates for relate to our changing the mix of earning assets  the fourth quarter sale of approximately million of investment securities with an average yield of and the second quarter sale of approximately million of securities with an average yield of approximately 
the proceeds from the sale of the securities were used to de leverage a portion of our balance sheet by reducing our overnight borrowings  which eliminated negative spread 
the changes in the yield rates for relate to our changing the mix of earning assets towards loans and the federal reserve board increases in the target federal funds rate 
total interest expense was million in compared to million in and to million in the increase in interest expense in is primarily due to rising interest rates caused by competitive pressures and the federal reserve board s increases to the target federal funds rate in  combined with the additional volume of interest bearing liabilities 
deposit pricing  especially cds  typically lags changes in the target federal funds rate  and therefore we did not see an immediate impact to the lowering of rates by the federal reserve board in the fourth quarter of due to those rate cuts  as well as further cuts in the first quarter of  we expect our interest rate expense  assuming a stable volume of interest bearing liabilities  to decline in the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to raising interest rates on deposits and the additional volume of interest bearing liabilities  which included the impact of jackson bank for the full year 
the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to for from in and increased basis points from in our rate increases in are a reflection of the market conditions and a greater reliance on higher cost non core funding 
average interest bearing liabilities increased million or in compared to and million or in compared to the increase in is primarily due to increases in in market certificates of deposits and the use of other borrowings  including fhlb overnight borrowings 
the significant increase in interest bearing liabilities in was due to our market penetration and the full year of jackson bank 
average total deposits grew million or to million in and increased million or to million in we feel that our average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities will decrease in the first half of the as our time deposits mature and reprice at current market rates  which have decreased since the federal reserve board s rate decrease initiative started in september of however  competitive pressures and our potential inability to raise core deposits  which could result in an increased use of higher cost alternative funding  may partially offset the impact of the rate cuts 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure the relative profitability of net interest income net interest rate spread and net interest margin 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest rate spread does not consider the impact of noninterest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percentage of total average earning assets and takes into account the positive effects of investing noninterest bearing deposits in earning assets

index to financial statements first security s net interest rate spread on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in  while the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis was in  in and in the decrease in the net interest spread and net interest margin for was primarily due to our rates on interest bearing liabilities rising faster than the yields on earning assets 
the decrease in the net interest spread and net interest margin for was primarily due to the jackson bank acquisition  the rates on interest bearing deposits increasing at a faster pace than the yields on earning assets due to the competition for deposits in our markets  the flat to inverted yield curve interest rate environment and the lag in cd repricing 
average interest bearing liabilities as a percentage of average earning assets was in  in and in in late june  we entered into a series of cash flow swaps with a total notional value of million 
floating rate cash flow payments on a portion of our prime based variable rate loans were swapped for fixed rate payments 
we entered the swaps to mitigate our interest rate risk in a falling interest rate environment 
the market volatility and the increasing anticipation of interest rate easing by the federal reserve created an unrealized gain of over million 
on august   we unwound the swaps and locked in a gain of approximately million 
the gain is being accreted into interest income over the expected term of the variable rate loans hedged 
for  the gain translates into basis points of income on million notional value 
the accretion of thousand for was included in interest income 
in october  we entered into a total of million notional value cash flow swaps 
the swaps exchanged a portion of or prime based variable rate payments for fixed rate payments 
the fixed rate is appropriately and the term is five years 
through january   the federal reserve board has reduced the target federal funds rate by basis points in a five month period 
further rate cuts are currently expected in we anticipate our margin to decrease between and basis points in the first quarter of from the margin for the fourth quarter of the margin for the remainder of will depend on our ability to raise core deposits  the growth rate in loans  and any possible further rate cuts by the federal reserve board 
in  the federal reserve board raised the target federal funds rate eight times by a total of basis points to 
in  the federal reserve board raised the target federal funds rate four times by a total of basis points to 
in  the federal reserve board reduced the target federal funds rate three times by a total of basis points to

as a result of our analysis  we determined that our quarterly provisions for the first half of  despite being lower than the comparable provisions made during  were adequate to provide for credit losses 
subsequent signs of weakness in the overall economy and the slow down in the regional and national housing markets prompted an increase in our provision for the third quarter 
further slowing of the local and regional economy as well as increases in classified loans and leases prompted an additional increase in the provision for the fourth quarter 
as of december   management determined our allowance was adequate to provide for credit losses 
management will reanalyze the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis  and the next review will be at march   or sooner if necessary  and the provision expense will be adjusted accordingly  if necessary 
we anticipate that during our provision expense for loan losses may increase to recognize increased risks in our loan portfolio  a weakening economy and projected loan growth 
our loan pipeline remains strong and we anticipate organic loan growth of approximately in as a result of our branching and marketing activities 
the loan portfolio increased by million or from year end compared to an increase of million or from year end to year end our allowance for loan and lease losses is also subject to regulatory examinations and determinations as to adequacy  which may take into account such factors as the methodology used to calculate the allowance and the size of the allowance compared to a group of peer banks 
during their routine examinations  regulators may require us to make additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses when  in the opinion of the regulators  their credit evaluations and allowance for loan and lease loss methodology differ materially from ours 
during  we made further enhancements to our methodology and analysis of the loan loss reserve and continued to implement improvements based on recent interagency regulatory guidance 
in addition to analyzing significant loans and leases  we segmented the remaining portfolio of loans and leases into similar or homogeneous pools such as purpose of proceeds  type of loan or lease or by collateral as per the regulatory guidance and statement of financial accounting standard the actual loss history of each pool was then added to the risk assessment percentage of eight qualitative and environmental categories to determine management s best estimate for risk of loss within each pool 
our primary grouping of loans and leases within the allowance are as follows significant classified loans and leases significant classified loans and leases generally include those loans with a risk rating of substandard and a total exposure exceeding thousand  as well as all loans and leases with a risk rating of doubtful 
for this group  management estimates the specific potential losses based upon an individual analysis of the relationship risks  the borrower s cash flow  the borrower s management and any underlying secondary sources of repayment 
if management believes or an outside third party s valuation indicates that the value of the secondary sources of repayment is less than the balance of the total corporate exposure  then a specific reserve is established or  if appropriate  the deficiency is charged off against the allowance 
the definition of both substandard and doubtful risk ratings are outlined in item below 
remaining loans and leases the remaining loans and leases not analyzed in item above are pooled based upon loan or lease type  collateral securing the loan or risk rating 
each of these pools is analyzed individually as homogeneous groups of loans or leases and are assigned a loss factor which is management s best estimate of the loss that potentially could be realized in that pool of loans or leases 
the loss factor is the sum of an objectively calculated historical loss percentage and a subjectively calculated risk assessment percentage 
the objectively calculated component is a historical loss factor for the pool based upon actual losses realized in the pool over several periods depending upon availability of data 
the actual annual historical loss factor is typically the average of each period s loss 
the subjectively calculated risk percentage is the sum of eight qualitative and environmental risk categories reviewed for each pool of loans and leases 
these subjective risk categories are as follows a underlying collateral values  b lending practices and policies  c local and national economies  d portfolio volume and nature  e staff experience  f credit quality  g loan review  and h competition  regulatory and legal issues

other classified and criticized loans we reserve for the remaining criticized and classified loan and lease pools not included in item above significant classified loans and leases using flat percentages based upon each pool s historical migration loss analysis or other documented loss rates 
the migration analysis is a calculation of the average loss experienced over several periods within each pass  criticized and classified risk rating to produce an actual loss rate of net charge offs 
the pass ratings are assigned to those loans that are performing as contractually agreed and do not exhibit the characteristics of criticized and classified risk ratings as defined below 
these actual loss percentages are then summed with the subjective risk categories as described in item above to produce a loss factor for each pool 
i 
loans with risk ratings of special mention we generally reserve for special mention loans and leases using a historical month migration loss percentage 
the historical loss factor and the qualitative and environmental factors  as described above in item  are applied to the appropriate pools of special mention loans and leases 
the special mention risk rating is considered a criticized loan and is not considered as severe as a classified loan risk rating 
special mention loans contain one or more potential weakness es  which if not corrected  could result in an unacceptable increase in credit risk at some future date 
these loans and leases may be characterized by loans to businesses downward trend in sales  profit levels and margins impaired working capital position compared to industry cash flow strained in order to meet debt repayment schedule technical defaults due to noncompliance with financial covenants recurring trade payable slowness high leverage compared to industry average with shrinking equity cushion questionable abilities of management weak industry conditions inadequate or outdated financial statements loans to businesses or individuals loan delinquencies and overdrafts may occur original source of repayment questionable documentation deficiencies may not be easily correctable loan may need to be restructured collateral or guarantor offers adequate protection unsecured debt to tangible net worth is excessive ii 
loans with risk ratings of substandard we generally reserve for substandard loans and leases that are not specifically identified in item using a historical month migration analysis loss rate 
the historical loss and qualitative and environmental factors  as described in item above  are applied to the appropriate pool of substandard loans and leases 
substandard loans and leases have specifically identified weaknesses and deficiencies typically resulting from severe adverse trends of a financial  economic  or managerial nature  and may warrant non accrual status

loans with risk ratings of doubtful we analyze doubtful loans and leases individually to determine our best estimate of loss based upon the most recent assessment of all available sources of repayment 
these loans are analyzed in the same manner as those loans categorized in item as significant classified loans and leases 
management estimates the specific potential losses based upon an individual analysis of the relationship risks  the borrower s cash flow  the borrower s management and any underlying secondary sources of repayment 
the amount of the estimated loss  if any  is then specifically reserved in a separate component of the allowance 
doubtful loans are loans where the collection or liquidation in full of principal and or interest is highly questionable or improbable 
doubtful loans must be placed on non accrual  and the principal balance charged down to estimated collectable value  or a full or partial reserve must be allocated 
in addition to the characteristics listed for substandard loans  the following characteristics apply to doubtful loans loans to businesses normal operations are severely diminished or have ceased seriously impaired cash flow numerous exceptions to loan agreement outside accountant questions entity s survivability as a going concern financial statements may be received late  if at all

unclassified and uncriticized loans in our analysis of these loan and lease pools  we establish our reserves using the historical average net charge off over various periods for each pool of loans 
the number of periods used to determine the average net charge off amount is dependent upon the available data  but generally is no less than months 
each of these pools historical loss rates are then adjusted by the eight qualitative and environmental risk areas  as described in item above  and applied to the appropriate pools of unclassified and uncriticized loans and leases 
for purposes of analyzing the allowance for loan losses  the unclassified and uncriticized loan pools do not include the unfunded portions of binding commitments to lend  standby letters of credit  deposit secured loans or mortgage loans originated with commitments to sell in the secondary market 
loans secured by segregated deposits held by us are not required to have an allowance reserve  nor are originated mortgage loans pending sale in the secondary market 
while it is our policy to charge off in the current period loans for which a loss is recognized  there are additional risks of future losses which cannot be quantified precisely or attributed to particular loans or classes of loans 
because these risks include the state of the economy  management s judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance is necessarily approximate and imprecise

we anticipate continued pressure for the mortgage department in due to the softness in the real estate market 
as described in net interest income section above  we de leveraged a portion of our balance sheet during april by selling approximately million in investment securities to pay down our overnight borrowings 
this transaction eliminated negative spread 
the sale occurred prior to the release of our quarterly report on form q for the period ended march   thereby triggering an other than temporary impairment of securities as of march  the impairment charge represents the loss position of the sold securities as of march   with an additional loss of thousand recognized upon the final sale in april

while we will be opportunistic  we are mindful of the additional expense associated with de novo growth branches 
total occupancy expense for increased by compared with  which was more than total occupancy expense in the increase in was primarily due to the opening of our new corporate headquarters in december  as well as the completion of our two new de novo branches in algood and cleveland  tennessee in april and may  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to a full year of expenses related to the five jackson bank branches which accounted for approximately thousand or of the overall increase 
as of december   we leased facilities and the land for five branches 
as a result  occupancy expense is higher than if we owned these facilities  including the real estate  but conversely  we have been able to deploy the capital into earning assets rather than capital expenditures for facilities 
furniture and equipment  communication and printing and supplies expense decreased in due to cost controls implemented

this program was implemented throughout all markets during we anticipate data processing expense to increase as we continue to grow 
intangible asset amortization decreased by thousand or in as compared to and increased thousand or in compared to the decrease in is due to the declining expense of the aging core deposit intangible assets 
the increase in is due to the full year of expense associated with the non compete and core deposit intangible asset associated with the jackson bank acquisition 
amortizing intangible assets include core deposit intangible assets  a license fee agreement  and a non compete agreement 
the core deposit intangible assets amortize on an accelerated basis over an estimated useful life of ten years 
the license fee agreement relates to operating the primer banco seguro branches within our market 
the original life of ten years was reduced to five years during when we recorded an impairment charge  which was recorded to other noninterest expense 
the non compete agreement is amortizing on a straight line basis of the useful life of four years 
each year  goodwill is evaluated for possible impairment 
to date  no indications of impairment have been identified  thus no impairment expense has been recorded

index to financial statements asset quality we consider our asset quality to be of primary importance 
at year end our net loan portfolio was of total assets 
over the past few years  we have improved our commercial and retail underwriting standards  enhanced our detailed loan policy  established better warning and early detection procedures  strengthened our commercial real estate risk management  improved our consumer portfolio risk pricing and standardized underwriting and developed a more comprehensive analysis of our allowance 
our loan review process targets to of our portfolio for review over an month cycle 
more frequent loan reviews may be completed as needed or as directed by the audit corporate governance committee of the board of directors 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate in relation to the risk of losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we analyze the loan portfolio regularly to identify potential problems 
we undertake this analysis in conjunction with the establishment of our allowance for loan losses to provide a basis for determining the adequacy of our loan loss reserves to absorb losses that we estimate might be experienced 
furthermore  our policy requires regularly scheduled problem asset meetings in which past due and classified loans are thoroughly analyzed 
these analyses are thoroughly reviewed by our credit administration group 
in addition to these analyses of existing loans  management considers our loan growth  historical loan losses  past due and non performing loans  current economic conditions  underlying loan collateral values and other factors which may affect possible loan losses

our allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans was and non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were basis points 
the largest components of non performing assets in were non accrual loans and other real estate owned 
for  the largest components were non accrual loans and repossessed assets 
the increase in non accrual loans is primarily attributable to one leasing relationship  which was reclassified as non accrual during the fourth quarter of the decrease in repossessed assets is due to the adoption of an aggressive sales approach during the fourth quarter 
we are actively marketing our repossessions in order to maximize value and minimize carrying cost 
loans days past due increased from to primarily due to one relationship  which consists of well secured land and construction development loans  for which we do not anticipate any significant losses 
during the fourth quarter of  we created a centralized collection department 
this department aggressively collects the past due loans and manages the marketing of the repossessions and other real estate owned

in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examinations  may require additional charges to the provision for loan losses in future periods if the results of their reviews warrant 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  other real estate under contract for sale and repossessed assets

investment securities and other earning assets the composition of our securities portfolio reflects our investment strategy of maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity while providing a relatively stable source of income 
our securities portfolio also provides a balance to interest rate risk and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for investing available funds  furnishing liquidity  and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain deposits and borrowed funds 
we use three categories to classify our securities held to maturity  available for sale and trading 
currently  all of our investments are classified as available for sale 
while we have no plans to liquidate a significant amount of any securities  the securities classified as available for sale may be used for liquidity purposes should management deem it to be in our best interest

as a result  we utilized the liquidity to assist in funding the loan growth 
as of december   we held thousand in certificates of deposit at other fdic insured financial institutions 
deposits and other borrowings deposits decreased by million  or  from year end to year end primarily due to our decision not to replace maturing brokered certificates of deposit with new brokered cds but rather to replace them with overnight borrowings 
our decision was based on anticipated declining interest rates during the second half of as a result of this decision and the actual decline in interest rates during the second half of the year  we estimate that this decision saved approximately thousand in interest expense during the fourth quarter of  and we are estimating interest savings of approximately thousand for at current interest rate levels  we anticipate shifting our funding allocation in the first half of  resulting in a decline in overnight borrowings and an increase in brokered cds 
excluding the impact of brokered cds  we organically grew our deposits million in the fastest growing sector of our core deposit base was retail cds  which increased million year over year 
we define core deposits to include interest bearing and non interest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts  as well as retail certificates of deposit with denominations less than  we consider our retail cds to be a stable source of funding because they are in market  relationship oriented deposits 
core deposit growth is an important tenet to our business strategy 
we believe that by improving our branching network  we will provide more convenient opportunities for customers to bank with us  and thus improve our core deposit funding 
for this reason  we plan to continue our de novo branch growth model 
as a result of these future branches and the branches we opened in the past few years  we anticipate that our deposits will continue to increase in the table below is a maturity schedule for our certificates of deposit  including brokered cds  in amounts of thousand or more as of december  less than months three months to six months six months to twelve months greater than twelve months in thousands certificates of deposit of or more brokered certificates of deposit at december  and  we had securities sold under repurchase agreements with commercial checking customers of million and million  respectively

interest rate sensitivity financial institutions are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that their interest bearing liabilities consisting principally of customer deposits mature or reprice more or less frequently  or on a different basis  than their interest earning assets generally consisting of intermediate or long term loans  investment securities and federal funds sold 
the match between the scheduled repricing and maturities of our earning assets and liabilities within defined time periods is referred to as gap analysis 
at december   our cumulative one year gap was a negative or liability sensitive million  or of total earning assets 
the cumulative one year gap as of december  was a negative million  or of total earning assets 
the increase is primarily related to our election to place maturing brokered cds into overnight borrowings in anticipation of falling interest rates 
the following gap analysis provides information based on maturities 
the interest rate risk income sensitivity summary table  located in item a incorporates additional assumptions  including prepayments on loans and securities and reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of loans  investments  and deposits

our cash balance on deposit with fsgbank  which totaled approximately million as of december   is available for funding activities for which fsgbank would not receive direct benefit  such as acquisition due diligence  shareholder relations  including dividends  and holding company reporting and operations 
these funds should adequately meet our cash flow needs

as of december   the outstanding overnight and term borrowings were million and million  respectively 
fsgbank also used its borrowing capacity at fhlb to purchase a letter of credit that we pledged to the state of tennessee bank collateral pool 
the letter of credit allows us to release investment securities from the collateral pool and thus improve our liquidity ratio 
additionally  fsgbank could increase its borrowing capacity at fhlb  subject to more stringent collateral requirements  by pledging loans other than family first mortgage and commercial real estate loans 
as of december   our unused borrowing capacity using family first mortgage and commercial real estate loans at fhlb was million 
fhlb maintains standards for loan collateral files 
therefore  our borrowing capacity may be restricted if our collateral file has exceptions  such as expired property insurance 
fsgbank also had unsecured federal funds lines in the aggregate amount of million at december   which it can use to borrow funds to meet short term liquidity needs 
the federal funds lines in use at year end totaled million 
another source of funding is loan participations sold to other commercial banks in which we retain the service rights 
as of year end  we had million in loan participations sold 
fsgbank may continue to sell loan participations as a source of liquidity 
we may also pledge investment securities against a line of credit at a commercial bank as an additional source of short term funding 
as of year end  we had no borrowings against our investment securities  except for repurchase agreements and public fund deposits attained in the ordinary course of business 
we utilize brokered cds to provide an additional source of funding for loan growth

an important function of the federal reserve board is to regulate the national money supply 
among the instruments of monetary policy used by the federal reserve board are purchases and sales of us government securities in the marketplace  changes in the discount rate  which is the rate any depository institution must pay to borrow from the federal reserve  and changes in the reserve requirements of depository institutions 
these instruments are effective in influencing economic and monetary growth  interest rate levels and inflation 
the monetary policies of the federal reserve board and other governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
because of changing conditions in the national and international economy and in the money market  as well as the result of actions by monetary and fiscal authorities  it is not possible to predict with certainty future changes in interest rates  deposit levels or loan demand or whether the changing economic conditions will have a positive or negative effect on operations and earnings 
legislation is from the time to time introduced in the united states congress and the tennessee general assembly and other state legislatures  and regulations are proposed by the regulatory agencies that could affect our business 
it cannot be predicted whether or in what form any of these proposals will be adopted or the extent to which our business may be affected thereby 
off balance sheet arrangements we are party to credit related financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit 
such commitments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
our exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments

goodwill is to be recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the noncontrolling interest over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are to be recognized in earnings  while contingent consideration classified as equity is not to be remeasured 
cost such as transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting  generally leading to recognizing expense and additionally  restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as post acquisition costs

additionally  sfas provides that application of the fair value option must be based on the fair value of an entire financial asset or financial liability and not selected risks inherent in those assets or liabilities 
sfas requires that assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value pursuant to the fair value option be reported in the financial statements in a manner that separates those fair values from the carrying amounts of similar assets and liabilities  which are measured using another measurement attribute 
sfas also provides expanded disclosure requirements regarding the effects of electing the fair value option on the financial statements

 which eliminates the requirement to reflect changes in accounting principles as cumulative adjustments to net income in the period of the change and requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for voluntary changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
if it is impracticable to determine the cumulative effect of the change to all prior periods  sfas requires that the new accounting principle be adopted prospectively 
for new accounting pronouncements  the transition guidance in the pronouncement should be followed 
retrospective application refers to the application of a different accounting principle to previously issued financial statements as if that principle had always been used 
sfas did not change the guidance for reporting corrections of errors  changes in estimates or for justification of a change in accounting principle on the basis of preferability 
sfas is effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r 
this statement is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
under apb  issuing stock options to employees generally resulted in recognition of no compensation cost 
sfas r requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
for public entities that do not file as small business issuers  sfas r is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period that begins after june  the adoption of sfas r resulted in compensation expense recorded to our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk  with respect to us  is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
the risk of loss can result in either lower fair market values or reduced net interest income 
we manage several types of risk  such as credit  liquidity and interest rate 
we consider interest rate risk to be a significant risk that could potentially have a large material effect on our financial condition 
further  we process hypothetical scenarios whereby we shock our balance sheet up and down for possible interest rate changes  we analyze the potential change positive or negative to net interest income  as well as the effect of changes in fair market values of assets and liabilities 
as we continue to diversify our risks  we anticipate utilizing the fair value option on future transactions in circumstances that we can match market value or interest rate sensitivity 
we do not deal in international instruments  and therefore are not exposed to the risks inherent to foreign currency 
additionally  as of december   we had no trading assets that exposed us to the risks in market changes 
our interest rate risk management is the responsibility of our board of directors asset liability committee alco 
the committee has established policies and limits for management to monitor  measure and coordinate our sources  uses  and pricing of funds 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense associated with our interest sensitive assets and liabilities also change  thereby impacting net interest income  the primary component of our earnings 
alco utilizes the results of both a static and dynamic gap report  as well as an income simulation report  to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to a sustained change in interest rates 
we monitor and forecast potential interest rate changes based on market data 
in a falling interest rate environment  we closely monitor our funding sources and pricing to minimize the impact to our net interest margin for our asset sensitive balance sheet 
the gap analysis projects net interest income based on both a rise and fall in interest rates of basis points ie over a twelve month period 
the model is based on actual repricing dates of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets 
we measure this exposure based on an immediate change in interest rates of basis points up or down 
given this scenario  we had  at year end  an exposure to falling rates and a benefit from rising rates 
more specifically  the model forecasts a decline in net interest income of million or  as a result of a basis point decline in rates 
the model also predicts a million increase in net interest income  or  as a result of a basis point increase in rates 
the forecasted results of the model are within the limits specified by our guidelines 
the following chart reflects first security s sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  the model is based on a static balance sheet and assumes that paydowns and maturities of both assets and liabilities are reinvested in like instruments at current interest rates  rates down basis points  and rates up basis points 
interest rate risk income sensitivity summary down bp current up bp dollar amounts in thousands net interest income change net interest income change net interest income the preceding sensitivity analysis is a modeling analysis  which changes periodically and consists of hypothetical estimates based upon numerous assumptions including interest rate levels  shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  rates on loans and deposits  reinvestments of paydowns and maturities of

in addition  there is no input for growth or a change in asset mix 
while assumptions are developed based on the current economic and market conditions  management cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ 
also  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that management might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
we use the sendero vision asset liability system which is a comprehensive interest rate risk measurement tool that is widely used in the banking industry 
generally  it provides the user with the ability to more accurately model both static and dynamic gap  economic value of equity  duration  and income simulations using a wide range of scenarios including interest rate shocks and rate ramps 
the system also has the capability to model derivative instruments such as interest rate swap contracts
