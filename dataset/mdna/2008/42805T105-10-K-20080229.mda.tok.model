item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition includes a discussion of periods prior to the consummation of the transactions 
accordingly  the discussion and analysis of historical periods prior to the year ended december  does not reflect the significant impact that the transactions had on us  including significantly increased leverage and liquidity requirements 
the statements in this discussion and analysis regarding industry outlook  our expectations regarding the performance of our business and the other non historical statements are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described in item a risk factors 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe to be relevant to an understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion together with the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  item a risk factors  item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
overview we are engaged principally in the business of renting cars and renting equipment 
our revenues primarily are derived from rental and related charges and consist of car rental revenues revenues from all company operated car rental operations  including charges to customers for the reimbursement of costs incurred relating to airport concession fees and vehicle license fees  the fueling of vehicles and the sale of loss or collision damage waivers  liability insurance coverage and other products  equipment rental revenues revenues from all company operated equipment rental operations  including amounts charged to customers for the fueling and delivery of equipment and sale of loss damage waivers  and other revenues fees and certain cost reimbursements from our licensees and revenues from our car leasing operations and our third party claim management services 
our equipment rental business also derives revenues from the sale of new equipment and consumables 
our expenses primarily consist of direct operating expenses primarily wages and related benefits  commissions and concession fees paid to airport authorities  travel agents and others  facility  self insurance and reservation costs  the cost of new equipment and consumables purchased for resale  and other costs relating to the operation and rental of revenue earning equipment  such as damage  maintenance and fuel costs  depreciation expense relating to revenue earning equipment including net gains or losses on the disposal of such equipment 
revenue earning equipment includes cars and rental equipment  selling  general and administrative expenses including advertising  and interest expense  net of interest income 
the car and equipment rental industries are significantly influenced by general economic conditions 
the car rental industry is also significantly influenced by developments in the travel industry  and  particularly  in airline passenger traffic 
our profitability is primarily a function of the volume  mix and pricing of rental transactions and the utilization of cars and equipment 
significant changes in the purchase price of cars and equipment or interest rates can also have a significant effect on our profitability depending on our ability to adjust pricing for these changes 
in the united states  model year program vehicle depreciation costs rose approximately and per car depreciation costs for model year us non program cars declined as compared to as a consequence of those changes in per car costs  as well as the larger proportion of our us fleet we have purchased as non program cars and other actions we have taken to mitigate program car cost increases  our net per car depreciation costs for model year cars in the united states have increased by less than from our net per car depreciation costs for model year us cars 
we expect model year vehicle depreciation costs in the united states to increase between to 
our business requires significant expenditures for cars and equipment  and consequently we require substantial liquidity to finance such expenditures 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
our car rental and equipment rental operations are seasonal businesses  with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during the spring and summer 
we have the ability to dynamically manage fleet capacity  the most significant portion of our cost structure  to meet market demand 
for instance  to accommodate increased demand  we increase our available fleet and staff during the second and third quarters of the year 
as business demand declines  fleet and staff are decreased accordingly 
a number of our other major operating costs  including airport concession fees  commissions and vehicle liability expenses  are directly related to revenues or transaction volumes 
in addition  our management expects to utilize enhanced process improvements  including efficiency initiatives and the use of our information systems  to help manage our variable costs 
approximately two thirds of our typical annual operating costs represent variable costs  while the remaining one third are fixed or semi fixed 
we also maintain a flexible workforce  with a significant number of part time and seasonal workers 
however  certain operating expenses  including minimum concession fees  rent  insurance  and administrative overhead  remain fixed and cannot be adjusted for seasonal demand 
as part of our effort to implement our strategy of reducing operating costs  we are evaluating our workforce and operations and making adjustments  including headcount reductions and process improvements to optimize work flow at rental locations and maintenance facilities as well as streamlining our back office operations  initiating business process reengineering and evaluating outsourcing opportunities 
when we make adjustments to our workforce and operations  we may incur incremental expenses that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce and operating structure  but we believe that increasing our operating efficiency and reducing the costs associated with the operation of our business are important to our long term competitiveness 
on january   we announced the first in a series of initiatives to further improve our competitiveness through targeted job reductions affecting approximately employees primarily at our corporate headquarters in park ridge  new jersey and our us service center in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
these reductions are expected to result in annualized savings of up to million 
on february   we announced the second initiative to further improve our competitiveness and industry leadership through targeted job reductions affecting approximately  employees primarily in our us car rental operations  with much smaller reductions occurring in our us equipment rental operations  the corporate headquarters in park ridge  new jersey  and the us service center in oklahoma city  oklahoma  as well as in canada  puerto rico  brazil  australia and new zealand 
these reductions are expected to result in annualized savings of up to million 
on june   we announced the third initiative to further improve our operational efficiency through targeted reductions affecting approximately positions in our us car and equipment rental operations  as well as financial and reservations related positions in our us service center in oklahoma city  oklahoma 
these reductions are expected to result in approximately million of annualized savings 
during  we began to implement cost reducing initiatives in our european operations  and we expect to continue implementation of these measures in these measures are expected to result in additional annualized savings of approximately million  a portion of which has already been realized in for the year ended december   our consolidated statement of operations includes restructuring charges relating to the initiatives discussed above of million 
during the fourth quarter of  we finalized or substantially completed contract terms with industry leading service providers to outsource select functions relating to real estate facilities management and construction  procurement and information technology 
substantially all of the selected functions in these areas will be transitioned to the third party service providers which will result in a decrease in headcount by the end of the third quarter of we expect to incur between million to million of restructuring costs in the first half of related to these initiatives 
we plan to announce  as plans are finalized  other efficiency initiatives during we currently anticipate incurring future charges to earnings in connection with those initiatives  however  we have not yet developed detailed estimates of these expenses 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
for the year ended december   based on publicly available information  we believe some us car rental brands experienced transaction day growth and rental rate revenue per transaction day  or rpd  increases compared to comparable prior periods 
for the year ended december   we experienced a low to mid single digit volume increase versus the prior period in the united states  while rpd was down less than one percentage point 
during the year ended december   we experienced mid to high single digit volume growth in our european operations and our car rental rpd was above the level of our rpd during the year ended december  in the three years ended december   we increased the number of our off airport rental locations in the united states by approximately to approximately  locations 
revenues from our us off airport operations grew during the same period  representing million  million and million of our total car rental revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and subsequent years  our strategy will include selected openings of new off airport locations  the disciplined evaluation of existing locations and the pursuit of same store sales growth 
our strategy includes increasing penetration in the off airport market and growing the online leisure market  particularly in the longer length weekly sector  which is characterized by lower vehicle costs and lower transaction costs at a lower rpd 
increasing our penetration in these sectors is consistent with our long term strategy to generate profitable growth 
when we open a new off airport location  we incur a number of costs  including those relating to site selection  lease negotiation  recruitment of employees  selection and development of managers  initial sales activities and integration of our systems with those of the companies who will reimburse the location s replacement renters for their rentals 
a new off airport location  once opened  takes time to generate its full potential revenues  and as a result revenues at new locations do not initially cover their start up costs and often do not  for some time  cover the costs of their ongoing operation 
from to  the equipment rental industry experienced downward pricing trends  measured by the rental rates charged by rental companies 
for the years ended december   and  we believe industry pricing  measured in the same way  improved in the united states and canada and only started to improve towards the end of in france and spain 
for the year ended december   based on publicly available information  we believe the us equipment rental industry experienced downward pricing  measured by the rental rates charged by rental companies 
herc experienced higher equipment rental pricing and volumes worldwide for the years ended december   and  with pricing increases in attributable to higher price activity in canada and europe offsetting lower price activity in the us during the years ended december  and  herc added six and eight us locations  respectively  one and two new canadian location s  respectively  and seven and seven locations in europe  respectively 
herc expects to add over additional locations worldwide in in connection with its us expansion  we expect herc will incur non fleet start up costs of approximately million per location and additional fleet acquisition costs  including costs to transport equipment from one branch to another  over an initial twelve month period of approximately to million per location 
in its european expansion  we expect herc will incur lower start up costs per location as compared with the united states 
property damage and business interruption from the hurricanes in florida and other gulf coast states did not have a material effect on our results of operations for the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and changes in these judgments and estimates may impact our future results of operations and financial condition 
for additional discussion of our accounting policies  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
revenue earning equipment our principal assets are revenue earning equipment  which represented approximately of our total assets as of december  revenue earning equipment consists of vehicles utilized in our car rental operations and equipment utilized in our equipment rental operations 
for the year ended december   of the vehicles purchased for our us and international car rental fleets were subject to repurchase by automobile manufacturers under contractual repurchase and guaranteed depreciation programs  subject to certain manufacturers car condition and mileage requirements  at a specific price during a specified time period 
these programs limit our residual risk with respect to vehicles purchased under these programs 
for all other vehicles  as well as equipment acquired by our equipment rental business  we use historical experience and monitor market conditions to set depreciation rates 
when revenue earning equipment is acquired  we estimate the period that we will hold the asset 
depreciation is recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated holding period  with the objective of minimizing gain or loss on the disposition of the revenue earning equipment 
depreciation rates are reviewed on an ongoing basis based on management s routine review of present and estimated future market conditions and their effect on residual values at the time of disposal 
upon disposal of the revenue earning equipment  depreciation expense is adjusted for the difference between the net proceeds received and the remaining net book value 
as market conditions change  we adjust our depreciation rates prospectively  over the remaining holding period  to reflect these changes in market conditions 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
public liability and property damage the obligation for public liability and property damage on self insured us and international vehicles and equipment represents an estimate for both reported accident claims not yet paid  and claims incurred but not yet reported 
the related liabilities are recorded on a non discounted basis 
reserve requirements are based on actuarial evaluations of historical accident claim experience and trends  as well as future projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
the adequacy of the liability is regularly monitored based on evolving accident claim history 
if our estimates change or if actual results differ from these assumptions  the amount of the recorded liability is adjusted to reflect these results 
pensions our employee pension costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension costs and obligations 
goodwill and other intangible assets we review goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable  and also review goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we performed an annual review in the second quarter of  consistent with past years  and no impairment was determined to exist 
subsequent to performing our annual impairment review  we changed the date for performing these tests to the fourth quarter based on financial information available through october  we believe this change in accounting principle is preferable because the new date more closely aligns with our annual budgeting process and allows for a better estimation of the future cash flows used in the discounted cash flow model that we use to test for impairment 
the change in accounting principle has no effect on our consolidated financial statements presented herein 
we conducted the impairment review during the fourth quarter of and no impairment was determined to exist 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested at least annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow methodology 
a significant decline in the projected cash flows used to determine fair value could result in a goodwill impairment charge 
the acquisition was recorded by allocating the cost of the assets acquired  including intangible assets and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date 
consequently  as a result of the acquisition  we have recognized significant intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we reevaluate the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets annually or as circumstances change 
those intangible assets considered to have indefinite useful lives are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value 
in addition  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of intangible assets might not be recoverable  we will perform an impairment review 
we estimate the fair value of our intangible assets using a discounted cash flow methodology 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our estimates are based upon historical trends  management s knowledge and experience and overall economic factors 
while we believe our estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and volatility in the markets we serve could affect our evaluations and result in an impairment charge to the carrying amount of our goodwill and our intangible assets 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
derivatives we utilize certain derivative instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk related to cash flow and interest rate exposure 
derivative instruments are entered into for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures 
we document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedge items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions 
these derivatives are marked to market either through other comprehensive income or earnings  depending upon their effectiveness 
the valuation used to mark these to market is a discounted cash flow method 
the key input is the current yield curve based upon market observable data 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statement of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
provisions are not made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states or are expected to be remitted free of taxes 
see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board  or the fasb  revised its sfas  no 
 with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the revised statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is to be recognized over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
we have accounted for our employee stock based compensation awards in accordance with sfas no 
r 
as disclosed in note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data  we estimated the fair value of options issued at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model  which includes assumptions related to volatility  expected term  dividend yield  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate 
because the stock of hertz holdings became publicly traded in november and has a short trading history  it is not practicable for us to estimate the expected volatility of our share price  or a peer company share price  because there is not sufficient historical information about past volatility 
therefore  we use the calculated value method to estimate the expected volatility  based on the dow jones specialized consumer services sub sector within the consumer services industry  and we use the us large capitalization component  which includes the top of the index universe by market value 
because historical exercise data does not exist  and because we meet the requirements of sab no 
 we use the simplified method for estimating the expected term 
sab no 
was set to expire on december  on december   the sec issued sab no 
which indicated that they will continue to accept  under certain circumstances  the use of the simplified method beyond december  we believe it is appropriate to continue to use this simplified method because we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term due to the limited period of time our common stock has been publicly traded 
the assumed dividend yield is zero 
the risk free interest rate is the implied zero coupon yield for us treasury securities having a maturity approximately equal to the expected term of the options  as of the grant dates 
we assume that in each year  of the options that are outstanding but not vested will be forfeited  based on our us pension plan withdrawal rate assumptions 
the non cash stock based compensation expense associated with the hertz global holdings  inc stock incentive plan  or the stock incentive plan  is pushed down from hertz holdings and recorded on the books at the hertz level 
results of operations in the following discussion  comparisons are made between the years ended december  and december  and december  and december  combined  notwithstanding the presentation in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and  the successor period ended december  and the predecessor period ended december  a split presentation of an annual period is required under gaap when a change in accounting basis occurs 
consequently  the combined presentation for is not a recognized presentation under gaap 
accounting for an acquisition requires that the historical carrying values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed be adjusted to fair value 
a resulting higher cost basis associated with the allocation of the purchase price impacts post acquisition period results  which impacts period to period comparisons 
we believe a discussion of the separate periods presented for the year ended december  in our consolidated statements of operations may impede understanding of our operating performance 
the impact of the acquisition on the day successor period ended december  does not materially affect the comparison of the annual periods and  accordingly  we have prepared the discussion of our results of operations by comparing the year ended december  combined with the year ended december  without regard to the differentiation between predecessor and successor results of operations for the predecessor period ended december  and the successor period ended december  successor combined successor predecessor for the periods from years ended december  january  to december  december  to december  in thousands of dollars revenues car rental     equipment rental     other      total revenues    expenses direct operating    depreciation of revenue earning equipment   selling  general and administrative   interest  net of interest income    total expenses    income loss before income taxes and minority interest  provision benefit for taxes on income   minority interest    net income loss     the following table sets forth for each of the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by the various line items in our consolidated statements of operations successor combined successor predecessor for the periods from years ended december  january  to december  december  to december  revenues car rental equipment rental other total revenues expenses direct operating depreciation of revenue earning equipment selling  general and administrative interest  net of interest income total expenses income loss before income taxes and minority interest provision benefit for taxes on income minority interest net income loss the following table sets forth certain of our selected car rental  equipment rental and other operating data for each of the periods indicated successor combined years ended  or as of december  selected car rental operating data worldwide number of transactions in thousands   domestic    international    worldwide transaction days in thousands a   domestic    international    worldwide rental rate revenue per transaction day b domestic international worldwide average number of company operated cars during the period domestic    international    adjusted pre tax income in millions of dollars c worldwide revenue earning equipment  net in millions of dollars selected worldwide equipment rental operating data rental and rental related revenue in millions of dollars d same store revenue growth e average acquisition cost of rental equipment operated during the period in millions of dollars    adjusted pre tax income in millions of dollars c revenue earning equipment  net in millions of dollars  other operating data cash flows from operating activities in million of dollars ebitda in millions of dollars f   corporate ebitda in millions of dollars f   a transaction days represents the total number of days that vehicles were on rent in a given period 
b car rental rate revenue consists of all revenue  net of discounts  associated with the rental of cars including charges for optional insurance products  but excluding revenue derived from fueling and concession and other expense pass throughs  neverlost units in the united states and certain ancillary revenue 
rental rate revenue per transaction day is calculated as total rental rate revenue  divided by the total number of transaction days  with all periods adjusted to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency 
our management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends 
this statistic is important to management as it represents the best measurement of the changes in underlying pricing in the car rental business and encompasses the elements in car rental pricing that management has the ability to control 
the following table reconciles our car rental revenue to our rental rate revenue and rental rate revenue per transaction day based on december  foreign exchange rates for the years ended december   and in millions of dollars  except as noted successor combined years ended december  car rental revenue per statement of operations   non rental rate revenue foreign currency adjustment rental rate revenue    transaction days in thousands    rental rate revenue per transaction day in whole dollars c on january   we changed our measure of segment profitability from income loss before income taxes and minority interest to adjusted pre tax income loss as this measure is now being utilized by management in making decisions about allocating resources to segments and measuring their performance 
management believes this measure better reflects the financial results from ongoing operations 
adjusted pre tax income loss is calculated as income loss before income taxes and minority interest plus non cash purchase accounting charges  non cash debt charges relating to the amortization of deferred debt financing costs and debt discounts  unrealized transaction gain loss on euro denominated debt through september  and certain one time charges and non operational items

non cash debt charges represent the amortization of deferred debt financing costs and debt discounts 
during the year ended december   also includes million associated with the ineffectiveness of our hvf swaps and the write off of million of unamortized debt costs associated with a debt modification 
during the year ended december   also includes million associated with the reversal of the ineffectiveness of our hvf swaps 
during the successor period ended december   also includes million associated with the ineffectiveness of our hvf swaps 
during the year ended december   includes an unrealized gain on interest rate swaptions 
represents a decrease in the employee vacation accrual during the year ended december   relating to a change in our us vacation policy which now provides for vacation entitlement to be earned ratably throughout the year versus the previous policy which provided for full vesting on january each year 
represents unrealized gains and losses on currency translation of our euro denominated debt 
on october   we designated this euro denominated debt as an effective net investment hedge of our euro denominated net investment in our foreign operations  as such we will no longer incur unrealized exchange transaction gains or losses in our consolidated statement of operations 
amounts for the year ended december   the successor period ended december  and predecessor period ended december   are based on actual results and therefore do not give effect to our new capital structure as if the debt associated with the acquisition and related purchase accounting adjustments had occurred on january  d equipment rental and rental related revenue consists of all revenue  net of discounts  associated with the rental of equipment including charges for delivery  loss damage waivers and fueling  but excluding revenue arising from the sale of equipment  parts and supplies and certain other ancillary revenue 
rental and rental related revenue is adjusted in all periods to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency 
our management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends 
this statistic is important to our management as it is utilized in the measurement of rental revenue generated per dollar invested in fleet on an annualized basis and is comparable with the reporting of other industry participants 
the following table reconciles our equipment rental revenue to our equipment rental and rental related revenue based on december  foreign exchange rates in millions of dollars successor combined year ended december  equipment rental revenue per statement of operations  equipment sales and other revenue foreign currency adjustment rental and rental related revenue    e same store revenue growth represents the change in the current period total same store revenue over the prior period total same store revenue as a percentage of the prior period 
the same store revenue amounts are adjusted in all periods to eliminate the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency 
our management believes eliminating the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency is appropriate so as not to affect the comparability of underlying trends 
f we present ebitda and corporate ebitda in this report to provide investors with supplemental measures of our operating performance and liquidity and  in the case of corporate ebitda  information utilized in the calculation of the financial covenants under our senior credit facilities 
ebitda  as used in this report  is defined as consolidated net income before net interest expense  consolidated income taxes and consolidated depreciation and amortization 
corporate ebitda differs from the term ebitda as it is commonly used 
corporate ebitda  as used in this report  means ebitda as that term is defined under our senior credit facilities  which is generally consolidated net income before net interest expense other than interest expense relating to certain car rental fleet financing  consolidated income taxes  consolidated depreciation other than depreciation related to the car rental fleet and amortization and before certain other items  in each case as more fully defined in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities 
the other items excluded in this calculation include  but are not limited to non cash expenses and charges  extraordinary  unusual or non recurring gains or losses  gains or losses associated with the sale or writedown of assets not in the ordinary course of business  certain management fees paid to the sponsors  and earnings to the extent of cash dividends or distributions paid from non controlled affiliates 
further  the covenants in our senior credit facilities are calculated using corporate ebitda for the most recent four fiscal quarters as a whole 
as a result  the measure can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter 
further  it may not be comparable to the measure for any subsequent four quarter period or for any complete fiscal year 
management uses ebitda and corporate ebitda as performance and cash flow metrics for internal monitoring and planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget and monthly operating reviews  as well as to facilitate analysis of investment decisions 
in addition  both metrics are important to allow us to evaluate profitability and make performance trend comparisons between us and our competitors 
further  we believe ebitda and corporate ebitda are frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industries 
ebitda is also used by management and investors to evaluate our operating performance exclusive of financing costs and depreciation policies 
further  because we have two business segments that are financed differently and have different underlying depreciation characteristics  ebitda enables investors to isolate the effects on profitability of operating metrics such as revenue  operating expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition to its use to monitor performance trends  ebitda provides a comparative metric to management and investors that is consistent across companies with different capital structures and depreciation policies 
this enables management and investors to compare our performance on a consolidated basis and on a segment basis to that of our peers 
in addition  our management uses consolidated ebitda as a proxy for cash flow available to finance fleet expenditures and the costs of our capital structure on a day to day basis so that we can more easily monitor our cash flows when a full statement of cash flows is not available 
corporate ebitda also serves as an important measure of our performance 
corporate ebitda for our car rental segment enables us to assess our operating performance inclusive of fleet management performance  depreciation assumptions and the cost of financing our fleet 
in addition  corporate ebitda for our car rental segment allows us to compare our performance  inclusive of fleet mix and financing decisions  to the performance of our competitors 
since most of our competitors utilize asset backed fleet debt to finance fleet acquisitions  this measure is relevant for evaluating our operating efficiency inclusive of our fleet acquisition and utilization 
for our equipment rental segment  corporate ebitda provides an appropriate measure of performance because the investment in our equipment fleet is longer term in nature than for our car rental segment and  therefore  corporate ebitda allows management to assess operating performance exclusive of interim changes in depreciation assumptions 
further  unlike our car rental segment  our equipment rental fleet is not financed through separate securitization based fleet financing facilities  but rather through our corporate debt 
corporate ebitda for our equipment rental segment is a key measure used to make investment decisions because it enables us to evaluate return on investments 
for both segments  corporate ebitda provides a relevant profitability metric for use in comparison of our performance against our public peers  many of whom publicly disclose a comparable metric 
in addition  we believe that investors  analysts and rating agencies consider ebitda and corporate ebitda useful in measuring our ability to meet our debt service obligations and make capital expenditures 
several of our material debt covenants are based on financial ratios utilizing corporate ebitda and non compliance with those covenants could result in the requirement to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under those agreements  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
ebitda and corporate ebitda are not recognized measurements under gaap 
when evaluating our operating performance or liquidity  investors should not consider ebitda and corporate ebitda in isolation of  or as a substitute for  measures of our financial performance and liquidity as determined in accordance with gaap  such as net income  operating income or net cash provided by operating activities 
ebitda and corporate ebitda may have material limitations as performance measures because they exclude items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations 
because other companies may calculate ebitda and corporate ebitda differently than we do  ebitda may not be  and corporate ebitda as presented in this filing is not  comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the calculation of corporate ebitda in the table below reflects historical financial data except for car rental fleet interest and non cash amortization of debt costs included in car rental fleet interest for the predecessor period presented which have been calculated on a pro forma basis to give effect to our new capital structure as if the fleet financings associated with the transactions had occurred on january  this calculation may not be representative of the calculation of corporate ebitda under our senior credit facilities for any period prior to december  because consolidated interest expense as defined in the agreements governing our senior credit facilities  a component of corporate ebitda  is calculated on a transitional basis until such date 
for periods prior to december   corporate ebitda under this transitional formula would have been higher than the amount shown in the table below 
accordingly  we believe that the presentation of this amount would be misleading to investors and have instead provided what we believe to be a more meaningful calculation of corporate ebitda 
borrowings under our senior credit facilities are a key source of our liquidity 
our ability to borrow under these senior credit facilities depends upon  among other things  the maintenance of a sufficient borrowing base and compliance with the financial ratio covenants based on corporate ebitda set forth in the credit agreements for our senior credit facilities 
our senior term loan facility requires us to maintain a specified consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated interest expense coverage ratio based on corporate ebitda  while our senior asset based loan facility requires that a specified consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio be maintained for periods during which there is less than million of available borrowing capacity under the senior asset based loan facility 
these financial covenants became applicable to us beginning september   reflecting the four quarter period ending thereon

the following table summarizes the purchase accounting effects of the acquisition on our results of operations for the year ended december  in millions of dollars depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets other intangible assets revenue earning equipment property and equipment accretion of revalued liabilities discount on debt workers compensation and public liability and property damage liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and equivalents of million  an increase of million from december  as of december   we had million of restricted cash to be used for the purchase of revenue earning vehicles and other specified uses under our fleet debt facilities  our like kind exchange programs and to satisfy certain of our self insurance regulatory reserve requirements 
our domestic and foreign operations are funded by cash provided by operating activities and by extensive financing arrangements maintained by us in the united states  europe  puerto rico  australia  new zealand  canada and brazil 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million from the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to a year over year improvements in working capital and net income 
our primary use of cash in investing activities is for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment  which consists of cars and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the disposal of revenue earning equipment  partly offset by a decrease in the year over year net change in restricted cash and a decrease in revenue earning equipment expenditures 
for the year ended december   our expenditures for revenue earning equipment were  million  partially offset by proceeds from the disposal of such equipment of  million 
these assets are purchased by us in accordance with the terms of programs negotiated with the car and equipment manufacturers 
for the year ended december   our expenditures for property and non revenue earning equipment were million 
for the year ended december   we experienced a level of net expenditures for revenue earning equipment and property and equipment slightly higher than our net expenditures for the year ended december  this increase was due to a year over year decrease in disposal proceeds relating to revenue earning equipment  partly offset by decreases in year over year expenditures for both revenue earning equipment and property and equipment 
for  we expect the level of net expenditures for revenue earning equipment  property and non revenue earning equipment to be similar to that of see capital expenditures below 
our car rental and equipment rental operations are seasonal businesses with decreased levels of business in the winter months and heightened activity during the spring and summer 
this is particularly true of our airport car rental operations and our equipment rental operations 
to accommodate increased demand  we maintain a larger fleet by holding vehicles and equipment and purchasing additional fleet which increases our financing requirements in the second and third quarters of the year 
these seasonal financing needs are funded by increasing the utilization of our bank credit facilities and the variable funding notes portion of our us fleet debt facilities and  in past years  our commercial paper program 
as business demand moderates during the winter  we reduce our fleet accordingly and dispose of vehicles and equipment 
the disposal proceeds are used to reduce debt 
we are highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs arise from debt service on indebtedness incurred in connection with the transactions and from the funding of our costs of operations  working capital and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had approximately  million of total indebtedness outstanding 
cash paid for interest during the year ended december   was million  net of amounts capitalized 
we rely significantly on asset backed financing to purchase cars for our domestic and international car rental fleets 
for further information concerning our asset backed financing programs  see fleet financing below 
for a discussion of risks related to our reliance on asset backed financing to purchase cars  see item a risk factors risks related to our business our reliance on asset backed financing to purchase cars subjects us to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control 
also  substantially all of our revenue earning equipment and certain related assets are owned by special purpose entities  or are subject to liens in favor of our lenders under the senior abl facility  the abs program  the international fleet debt facilities or the fleet financing facility relating to our car rental fleet in hawaii  kansas  puerto rico and st 
thomas  the us virgin islands  brazil  canada  belgium and our uk leveraged financing  all as described in more detail below 
substantially all our other assets in the united states are also subject to liens in favor of our lenders under the senior credit facilities  and substantially all of our other assets outside the united states are with certain limited exceptions subject to liens in favor of our lenders under the international fleet debt facilities or in the case of our canadian herc business the senior abl facility 
none of such assets will be available to satisfy the claims of our general creditors 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the senior credit facilities  asset backed financing and other available financing arrangements will be adequate to permit us to meet our debt service obligations  ongoing costs of operations  working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
our future financial and operating performance  ability to service or refinance our debt and ability to comply with covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
recent turmoil in the credit markets and the financial instability of insurance companies providing financial guarantees for asset backed securities has reduced the availability of debt financing  which may result in increases in the interest rates at which lenders are willing to make debt financing available to us 
the impact of such an increase would be more significant than it would be for some other companies because of our substantial debt

the variable funding notes will be funded through the bank multi seller commercial paper market 
the assets of hvf  including the us car rental fleet owned by hvf and certain related assets  collateralize the us fleet debt and pre acquisition abs notes 
consequently  these assets will not be available to satisfy the claims of our general creditors

in connection with the acquisition and the issuance of  million of floating rate us fleet debt  hvf entered into certain interest rate swap agreements  or the hvf swaps  effective december   which qualify as cash flow hedging instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
these agreements mature at various terms  in connection with the scheduled maturity of the associated debt obligations  through november under these agreements  hvf pays monthly interest at a fixed rate of per annum in exchange for monthly amounts at one month libor  effectively transforming the floating rate us fleet debt to fixed rate obligations 
hvf paid million to reduce the fixed interest rate on the swaps from the prevailing market rates to 
ultimately  this amount will be recognized as additional interest expense over the remaining terms of the swaps  which range from approximately to years 
for the year ended december   we recorded an expense of million in our consolidated statement of operations  in interest  net of interest income  associated with the ineffectiveness of our hvf swaps 
the ineffectiveness resulted from a decline in the value of the swaps due to a decrease in forward interest rates along with a decrease in the time value component as we continue to approach the maturity dates of the swaps 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of the swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december  and  the balance reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax  was a loss of million  and a gain of million  respectively

in connection with the entrance into the hvf swaps  hertz entered into seven differential interest rate swap agreements  or the differential swaps 
these differential swaps were required to be put in place to protect the counterparties to the hvf swaps in the event of an amortization event under the asset backed notes agreements 
in the event of an amortization event  the amount by which the principal balance on the floating rate portion of the us fleet debt is reduced  exclusive of the originally scheduled amortization  becomes the notional amount of the differential swaps  and is transferred to hertz 
there was no payment associated with these differential swaps and their notional amounts are and will continue to be zero unless there is an amortization event  which causes the amortization of the loan balance  or the debt is prepaid 
an event of bankruptcy as defined in the indentures governing the us fleet debt with respect to mbia or ambac would constitute an amortization event under the portion of the us fleet debt facilities guaranteed by the affected insurer 
in that event we would also be required to apply a proportional amount  or substantially all in the case of insolvency of both insurers  of all rental payments by hertz to its special purpose leasing subsidiary and all car disposal proceeds under the applicable facility  or under substantially all us fleet debt facilities in the case of insolvency of both insurers  to pay down the amounts owed under the facility or facilities instead of applying those proceeds to purchase additional cars and or for working capital purposes

the us fleet debt is subject to events of default and amortization events that are customary in nature for us rental car asset backed securitizations of this type 
the occurrence of an amortization event or event of default could result in the acceleration of principal of the notes and a liquidation of the us car rental fleet

revenue earning equipment expenditures in our car rental and equipment rental operations for the year ended december  increased by and decreased by  respectively  compared to the year ended december  the increase in our car rental revenue earning equipment expenditures is primarily due to higher rental volumes during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   which required us to maintain higher fleet levels 
the decrease in our equipment rental operations revenue earning equipment expenditures is primarily due to reduced spending on earth moving equipment as a result of slowing non residential construction growth and our efforts to age our equipment rental fleet during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  revenue earning equipment expenditures in our car rental and equipment rental operations for the year ended december  decreased by and  respectively  compared to the year ended december  the decrease in our car rental revenue earning equipment expenditures is due to the change in the mix of purchases made during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  property and equipment expenditures in our car rental operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

for the year ended december   we experienced a level of net expenditures for revenue earning equipment and property and equipment slightly lower than our net expenditures in this decrease was due to a decrease in the percentage of program cars purchased and an increase in the percentage of lower cost non program cars purchased for the year ended december  off balance sheet commitments as of december  and december   the following guarantees including indemnification commitments were issued and outstanding indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the relevant industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction such as the sale of a business 
these indemnifications might include claims relating to the following environmental matters  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and employment related matters  customer  supplier and other commercial contractual relationships  and financial matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
we regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and have accrued for expected losses that are probable and estimable 
the types of indemnifications for which payments are possible include the following sponsors  directors on the closing date  hertz entered into customary indemnification agreements with hertz holdings  the sponsors and hertz holdings stockholders affiliated with the sponsors  pursuant to which hertz holdings and hertz will indemnify the sponsors  hertz holdings stockholders affiliated with the sponsors and their respective affiliates  directors  officers  partners  members  employees  agents  representatives and controlling persons  against certain liabilities arising out of performance of a consulting agreement with hertz holdings and each of the sponsors and certain other claims and liabilities  including liabilities arising out of financing arrangements or securities offerings 
we also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors in connection with the initial public offering of our common stock in november we do not believe that these indemnifications are reasonably likely to have a material impact on us 
environmental we have indemnified various parties for the costs associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage  recycling or disposal sites in many states and  in some instances  for natural resource damages 
the amount of any such expenses or related natural resource damages for which we may be held responsible could be substantial 
the probable losses that we expect to incur for such matters have been accrued  and those losses are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and december   the aggregate amounts accrued for environmental liabilities  including liability for environmental indemnities  reflected in our consolidated balance sheet in other accrued liabilities were million and million  respectively 
the accrual generally represents the estimated cost to study potential environmental issues at sites deemed to require investigation or clean up activities  and the estimated cost to implement remediation actions  including on going maintenance  as required 
cost estimates are developed by site 
initial cost estimates are based on historical experience at similar sites and are refined over time on the basis of in depth studies of the sites 
for many sites  the remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible cannot be reasonably estimated because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site  the materials there  the involvement of other potentially responsible parties  the application of laws and other standards or regulations  site conditions  and the nature and scope of investigations  studies  and remediation to be undertaken including the technologies to be required and the extent  duration  and success of remediation 
risk management for a discussion of additional risks arising from our operations  including vehicle liability  general liability and property damage insurable risks  see item business risk management 
market risks we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and historically have not been used for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  derivative financial instruments are entered into with a diversified group of major financial institutions in order to manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on such instruments 
for more information on these exposures  see note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
interest rate risk from time to time  we may enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
in connection with the acquisition and the issuance of  million of floating rate us fleet debt  hvf and hertz entered into seven interest rate swap agreements  or the hvf swaps  effective december   which qualify as cash flow hedging instruments in accordance with sfas the hvf swaps were entered into for the purpose of locking in the interest cash outflows on the floating rate us fleet debt 
these agreements mature at various terms  in connection with the scheduled maturity of the associated debt obligations  through november under these agreements  hvf pays monthly interest at a fixed rate of per annum in exchange for monthly amounts at one month libor  effectively transforming the floating rate us fleet debt to fixed rate obligations 
in connection with the entrance into the hvf swaps  hertz entered into seven differential interest rate swap agreements  or the differential swaps 
these differential swaps were required to be put in place to protect the counterparties to the hvf swaps in the event of an amortization event under the asset backed notes agreements 
in the event of an amortization event  the amount by which the principal balance on the floating rate portion of the us fleet debt is reduced  exclusive of the originally scheduled amortization  becomes the notional amount of the differential swaps  and is transferred to hertz 
there was no payment associated with these differential swaps and their notional amounts are and will continue to be zero unless there is an amortization event  which causes the amortization of the loan balance  or the debt is prepaid 
an event of bankruptcy as defined in the indentures governing the us fleet debt with respect to mbia or ambac would constitute an amortization event under the portion of the us fleet debt facilities guaranteed by the affected insurer 
in that event we would also be required to apply a proportional amount  or substantially all in the case of insolvency of both insurers  of all rental payments by hertz to its special purpose leasing subsidiary and all car disposal proceeds under the applicable facility  or under substantially all us fleet debt facilities in the case of insolvency of both insurers  to pay down the amounts owed under the facility or facilities instead of applying those proceeds to purchase additional cars and or for working capital purposes 
an insurer event of bankruptcy could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we were unable to negotiate mutually acceptable new terms with our us fleet debt lenders or if alternate funding were not available to us 
in connection with the remaining million untendered balance of our euro medium term notes  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on december   effective january   and maturing on july  the purpose of this interest rate swap is to lock in the interest cash outflows at a fixed rate of on the variable rate euro medium term notes 
on june   the remaining notes outstanding and related interest rate swap agreements pursuant to the euro medium term note program were repaid in full and expired  respectively 
in may  in connection with the forecasted issuance of the permanent take out international asset based facilities  hil purchased two swaptions for million  to protect itself from interest rate increases 
these swaptions gave hil the right  but not the obligation  to enter into three year interest rate swaps  based on a total notional amount of million at an interest rate of 
the swaptions were renewed twice in  prior to their scheduled expiration dates of march  and september   at a total cost of million  and now expire on june  see notes and to the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
we have a significant amount of debt including under our us and international fleet debt and senior abl facility with variable rates of interest based generally on libor  euribor or their equivalents for local currencies plus an applicable margin 
increases in interest rates could therefore significantly increase the associated interest payments that we are required to make on this debt 
we have assessed our exposure to changes in interest rates by analyzing the sensitivity to our earnings assuming various changes in market interest rates 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percentage point in interest rates on our debt portfolio as of december   our net income would decrease by an estimated million over a twelve month period 
consistent with the terms of the agreements governing the respective debt obligations  we may hedge a portion of the floating rate interest exposure under the senior credit facilities and the us and international fleet debt to provide protection in respect of such exposure 
foreign currency risk we manage our foreign currency risk primarily by incurring  to the extent practicable  operating and financing expenses in the local currency in the countries in which we operate  including making fleet and equipment purchases and borrowing for working capital needs 
also  we have purchased foreign exchange options to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates for selected marketing programs 
the effect of exchange rate changes on these financial instruments would not materially affect our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our risks with respect to currency option contracts are limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option and the future performance of the option s counterparty 
premiums paid for options outstanding as of december   were approximately million  and we limit counterparties to financial institutions that have strong credit ratings 
we also manage exposure to fluctuations in currency risk on intercompany loans we make to certain of our subsidiaries by entering into foreign currency forward contracts at the time of the loans 
the forward rate is reflected in the intercompany loan rate to the subsidiaries  and as a result  the forward contracts have no material impact on our results of operations 
in connection with the transactions  we issued million of unhedged senior euro notes 
prior to october   our senior euro notes were not designated as a net investment hedge of our euro denominated net investment in our foreign operations 
for the nine months ended september   we incurred unrealized exchange transaction losses of million resulting from the translation of these euro denominated notes into the us dollar  which are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations in selling  general and administrative expenses 
on october   we designated our senior euro notes as an effective net investment hedge of our euro denominated net investment in our foreign operations 
as a result of this net investment hedge designation  as of december   million of losses  which are net of tax of million  attributable to the translation of our senior euro notes into the us dollar are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
inflation the increased acquisition cost of vehicles is the primary inflationary factor affecting us 
many of our other operating expenses are also expected to increase with inflation  including health care costs 
management does not expect that the effect of inflation on our overall operating costs will be greater for us than for our competitors 
like kind exchange program in january  we implemented a like kind exchange program for our us car rental business 
pursuant to the program  we dispose of vehicles and acquire replacement vehicles in a form intended to allow such dispositions and replacements to qualify as tax deferred like kind exchanges pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
the program has resulted in a material deferral of federal and state income taxes for fiscal a like kind exchange program for herc has been in place for several years 
we cannot  however  offer assurance that the expected tax deferral will be achieved or that the relevant law concerning the programs will remain in its current form 
in addition  the benefit of deferral is subject to recapture  if  for example  there were a material downsizing of our fleet 
employee retirement benefits pension we sponsor defined benefit pension plans worldwide 
pension obligations give rise to significant expenses that are dependent on assumptions discussed in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report under the caption item financial statements and supplementary data 
our worldwide pre tax pension expense was approximately million  which is an increase of million from the increase in expense compared to is attributable to net curtailment and settlement charges of million and the effects of foreign currency translation 
to the extent that there are layoffs affecting a significant number of employees covered by any pension plan worldwide  expense could vary significantly because of further charges or credits 
the funded status ie  the dollar amount by which the present value of projected benefit obligations exceeded the market value of pension plan assets of our us qualified plan  in which most domestic employees participate  declined as of december   compared with december  the ratio of assets to the projected benefit obligation was consistent from december  to december  the primary reason for the decline in dollar terms is that no contributions were made in we review our pension assumptions regularly and from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required 
for example  no discretionary contributions were made to our us qualified plan in the years ended december  and and a million was made to our us qualified plan for the year ended december  after giving effect to these contributions  based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions  we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the pension benefit guaranty corporation before for the years ended december  and  we contributed million and million  respectively  to our worldwide pension plans  including a discretionary contribution of million and million  respectively  to our uk defined benefit pension plan and benefit payments made through unfunded plans 
we participate in various multiemployer pension plans administrated by labor unions representing some of our employees 
we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to their participants 
in the event that we withdraw from participation in one of these plans  then applicable law could require us to make an additional lump sum contribution to the plan  and we would have to reflect that as an expense in our statement of operations and as a liability on our balance sheet 
our withdrawal liability for any multiemployer plan would depend on the extent of the plan s funding of vested benefits 
in the ordinary course of our renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements with labor unions that maintain these plans  we could decide to discontinue participation in a plan  and in that event we could face a withdrawal liability 
some multiemployer plans  including one in which we participate  are reported to have significant underfunded liabilities 
such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability 
other postretirement benefits we provide limited postretirement health care and life insurance for employees of our domestic operations with hire dates prior to january  there are no plan assets associated with this plan 
we provide for these postretirement costs through monthly accruals 
the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended december  was million and the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  was million compared to a net periodic postretirement benefit cost of million for the year ended december  and an accumulated benefit obligation of million as of december  the decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation was primarily attributable to the increase in the discount rate from as of december  to as of december  hertz holdings stock incentive plan on february   our board of directors and that of hertz jointly approved the hertz global holdings  inc stock incentive plan  or the stock incentive plan 
the stock incentive plan provides for the sale of shares of stock of hertz holdings to our executive officers  other key employees and directors as well as the grant of stock options to purchase shares of hertz holdings to those individuals 
during the second quarter of  we made an equity offering to approximately of hertz s executives and key employees not including craig r 
koch  our former chief executive officer 
the shares sold and options granted to our employees in connection with this equity offering are subject to and governed by the terms of the stock incentive plan 
the offering closed on may  in connection with this offering  we sold  shares at a purchase price of per share and granted options to purchase an additional  shares at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for special cash dividends paid on june  and november  
in addition  on may   we granted hertz s key executives and employees except for mr 
koch options to acquire an additional  shares of our common stock at per share after adjustment for special cash dividends paid on june  and november    shares at per share after adjustment for special cash dividends paid on june  and november  and  shares at per share after adjustment for special cash dividends paid on june  and november  
these options are subject to and governed by the stock incentive plan 
on june   mr 
koch purchased  shares of the common stock of hertz holdings at a purchase price of per share and received options to purchase an additional  shares at a purchase price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on june  
on august   the options issued to mr 
koch in june were cancelled and he was issued options to purchase  shares of common stock of hertz holdings at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november  
hertz holdings made a payment to mr 
koch in connection with his share purchase equal to on august   certain newly hired employees purchased an aggregate of  shares at a purchase price of per share and were granted options to purchase  shares of hertz holdings stock at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november  
also on august   in accordance with the terms of his employment agreement  mr 
frissora purchased  shares of the common stock of hertz holdings at a price of per share and was granted options to purchase  shares of common stock of hertz holdings at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november    options at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november  and  options at an exercise price of per share after adjustment for the special cash dividend paid on november  
all of mr 
frissora s options will vest per year on the first five anniversaries of the date of commencement of his employment and will have a ten year term 
during september  we determined that the fair value of our common stock as of august  was per share  rather than the that had originally been determined at that time and which we use for purposes of the stock incentive plan and federal income tax purposes 
consequently  we recognized compensation expense of approximately million  including amounts for a tax gross up on the initial discount to fair market value in accordance with mr 
frissora s employment agreement  in the quarter ended september  in order to assist management and the compensation committee of the board of directors in their determination of the value of the common stock of hertz holdings  hertz engaged an independent valuation specialist to perform a valuation of the common stock of hertz holdings at may  and june  the may th date is close to the initial stock purchase and option grant date of may  and the second option grant date of may  the june th date coincides with the payment of the special cash dividend of per share 
the independent valuation specialist weighted each of the income  market transaction and market comparable valuation approaches equally 
management and the compensation committee of the board of directors believe that the valuation approaches employed are appropriate for an enterprise such as hertz holdings  which has an established financial history of profitable operations and generation of positive cash flows 
the results of the approaches were not significantly different from one another 
in connection with the authorization of the special cash dividend of per share paid on june   the board of hertz holdings authorized the modification of the option exercise prices downward by an amount equal to the per share amount of the special cash dividend paid on june   thereby preserving the intrinsic value of the options  consistent with applicable tax law 
in order to assist management and the compensation committee of the board of directors in their determination of the value of the common stock of hertz holdings  an independent valuation was performed as of immediately before and after the modification 
we will recognize incremental compensation cost of approximately million related to the cost of modifying the exercise prices of the stock options for the special cash dividend over the remainder of the five year requisite vesting period that began on the grant date 
prior to the consummation of the initial public offering of the common stock of hertz holdings on november   hertz holdings declared a special cash dividend  to be paid promptly following the completion of the offering 
in connection with the special cash dividend  hertz holdings outstanding stock options were adjusted to preserve the intrinsic value of the options  consistent with applicable tax law and the terms of the stock incentive plan 
the board approved this modification on october  beginning on that date  the cost of the modification was recognized ratably over the remainder of the requisite service period for each grant 
because the modification was effective before the amount of the dividend was known  the cost of the modification reflected the assumption that the dividend would be funded by the proceeds to hertz holdings from the sale of the common stock after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
the assumed proceeds from the sale of the common stock were determined by assuming an offering price equivalent to the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of the initial public offering prospectus or per share and resulted in an estimated dividend of per share 
the actual dividend declared was per share 
we will recognize incremental compensation cost of million related to the cost of modifying the exercise prices of the stock options for the special cash dividend paid on november  over the remainder of the five year requisite service period 
this charge was based on the estimated dividend  rather than the actual dividend paid 
in may  hertz holdings granted options to acquire  shares of hertz holdings common stock to key executives  employees and non management directors at exercise prices ranging from to 
in august  hertz holdings granted options to acquire  shares of hertz holdings common stock to certain executives  including an award to mark p 
frissora  our chief executive officer  at exercise prices ranging from to 
in november  hertz holdings granted options to acquire  shares of hertz holdings common stock to certain executives at exercise prices ranging from to 
these options are subject to and governed by the terms of the stock incentive plan  and the hertz global holdings  inc director stock incentive plan  or the director plan 
we have accounted for our employee stock based compensation awards in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the options are being accounted for as equity classified awards 
for the year ended december   we recognized compensation cost of million million  net of tax including million related to restructuring activities 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock options granted by hertz holdings under the stock incentive plan  including costs related to modifying the exercise prices of certain option grants in order to preserve the intrinsic value of the options  consistent with applicable tax law  to reflect special cash dividends of per share paid on june  and per share paid on november  these remaining costs are expected to be recognized over the remaining years  on a weighted average basis  of the requisite service period that began on the grant dates
