critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the 
index significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following the company recognizes revenues from product sales or services provided when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated and amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which supersedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  effective february   the company s unamortized goodwill balance is being assessed  at least annually  for impairment 
the company performs its annual impairment test for each reporting unit using a fair value approach 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units  which comprise our operating segments 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows method  we rely on a number of assumptions including sales and related gross margin projections  operating margins  anticipated working capital requirements and market rate of returns used in discounting projected cash flows 
these assumptions were based upon market and industries outlooks  our business plans and historical data 
inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors 
the discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents a weighted average cost of capital applicable to the company 
during the fiscal year ended january   we performed an impairment analysis on each of the company s reporting units that carry goodwill on their balance sheets 
in each case  except for the flex kleen reporting unit which represents of the total company wide goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount  including goodwill  by a significant amount 
for the flex kleen reporting unit  the carrying value  including goodwill of million  as of january  and  amounted to million and million  respectively 
the fair value of the flex kleen reporting unit as of january  and totaled million and million  respectively 
as a result  the fair value exceeded the carrying amount  including goodwill  by million and million in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
therefore  as of january   the flex kleen reporting unit s goodwill was not impaired 
our flex kleen reporting unit  which initially performed well after being acquired in  thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets  followed by improved performance in the fiscal years ended january   and in the fiscal years ended january   and  the actual results exceeded the projected results used in the impairment model 
because of market conditions and or potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
based on current projections  a one percent decrease in revenue growth  a one percent decrease in gross margin or a one percent increase in the weighted average cost of capital would reduce the fair value for the flex kleen reporting unit by million  million  and million  respectively 
additionally  the company cannot predict the occurrence of unknown events that might adversely affect the reportable value of costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired 
the determination of our obligation and expense for pension benefits is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future expense 

index forward looking statements  factors that may affect future results our prospects are subject to certain uncertainties and risk 
this annual report on form k also contains certain forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these forward looking statements may be identified by words describing our belief or expectation  such as where we say that we believe  expect or anticipate  or where we characterize something in a manner in which there is an express or implicit reference to the future  such as non recurring or unusual  or where we express that our view is based upon the current status of a given matter  or upon facts as we know them as of the date of the statement 
the content and or context of other statements that we make may indicate that the statement is forward looking 
we claim the safe harbor provided by the private securities reform act of for all forward looking statements 
results may differ materially from our current results and actual results could differ materially from those suggested in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below  other one time events  other important factors disclosed previously and from time to time in met pro s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following important factors  along with those discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k  could affect our future financial condition and results of operations  and could cause our future financial condition and results of operations to differ materially from those expressed in our sec filings and in our forward looking statements the write down of costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired goodwill  as a result of the determination that the acquired business is impaired 
our flex kleen business unit  which initially performed well after being acquired by met pro  thereafter had several years of declining performance which we attributed primarily to a general weakness in its served markets  followed by improved performance in the fiscal years ended january    and during the fiscal year ended january   we performed an impairment analysis of the million of goodwill that the company carries for flex kleen and concluded that no impairment had occurred 
for the fiscal year ended january   the actual net sales and operating profit for our flex kleen business unit have exceeded the projections used in our annual impairment model 
however  flex kleen s backlog as of january  totaled million  which was a decrease of from the backlog amount at the same point in the prior fiscal year 
notwithstanding this decrease in backlog as of january   we anticipate that flex kleen s performance during the fiscal year beginning february  will be at a level that will not indicate impairment of its goodwill  but this expectation is a forward looking statement where the actual results may not be as we presently anticipate  materially adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets served by us or in significant customers of ours  material changes in available technology  adverse developments in the asbestos cases that have been filed against the company  including without limitation the exhaustion of insurance coverage  the imposition of punitive damages or other adverse developments in the availability of insurance coverage  changes in accounting rules promulgated by regulatory agencies  including the sec  which could result in an impact on earnings  the cost of compliance with sarbanes oxley and other applicable legal and listing requirements  and the unanticipated possibility that met pro may not meet these requirements  weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  which either alone or combined with actions by our employees intended to circumvent our internal control over financial reporting  to violate our policies  or to commit fraud or other bad acts  could lead to incorrect reporting of financial results 
during the current fiscal year  we restated our financial statements for the fiscal quarters ended october  through october  as well as for the fiscal year ended january  as a result of revenue recognition errors and other financial statement errors that we made due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that was exploited by an employee who sought to circumvent our internal controls and other policies and procedures 
although we have instituted new controls and procedures intended to improve our control over revenue recognition and believe that our internal control over financial reporting as of january  is effective  there are limits to any control system and we cannot give absolute assurance that our internal control is effective or that financial statement misstatements will not occur or that policy violations and or fraud within the company will not occur  unexpected results in our product development activities  loss of key customers  changes in product mix and the cost of materials  with effect on margins  changes in our existing management  exchange rate fluctuations  changes in federal laws  state laws and regulations  lower than anticipated return on investments in the company s defined benefit plans  which could affect the amount of the company s pension liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
for met pro corporation  these exposures are primarily related to changes in interest rates 
we do not currently hold any derivatives or other financial instruments purely for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair value of the company s total long term debt and current maturities of long term debt  at january  was million 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease increase in future earnings and cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase decrease in the company s estimated weighted average borrowing rate at january  although most of the interest on the company s debt is indexed to either the libor or euribor market rates  there would be no material effect on the future earnings or cash flows related to the company s total debt for such a hypothetical change 
the company has only a limited involvement with derivative financial instruments 
the company has two separate interest rate swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact on earnings from increases in market interest rates 
effective october   the company entered into a ten year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount equal to the balance on the note payable maturing october the company swapped the ninety day libor for a fixed rate of 
as a result  the effective fixed interest rate is 
effective april   the company entered into a fifteen year interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount equal to the balance on the bond payable maturing april the company swapped the ninety day libor for a fixed rate of 
as a result  the effective fixed interest rate is

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment to fasb statement no 

there was no hedge ineffectiveness as of january  the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements resulted in a decrease in equity of  net of tax at january  and a decrease in equity of  net of tax at january  these results are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive loss section of shareholders equity 
see note  debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company has wholly owned subsidiaries located in the netherlands  canada and the people s republic of china 
in the past  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure  and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results 
future changes in exchange rates may positively or negatively impact our revenues  operating expenses and earnings 
due to the limited size of our foreign operations  however  we do not anticipate that exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations will be material in the fiscal year ended january  all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of any related tax effect  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
at january  the company s marketable securities had a fair market value of  which includes an unrealized loss of  the marketable securities are composed of shares of armstrong world industries  inc awi distributed to met pro as part of a chapter reorganization settlement in october of the potential loss in fair value resulting from a adverse change in the equity prices of these marketable securities would be negligible to the company overall
