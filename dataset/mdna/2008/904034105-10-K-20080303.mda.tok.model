overview ultratech  inc develops  manufactures and markets photolithography and laser thermal processing equipment for manufacturers of integrated circuits and nanotechnology components located throughout north america  europe  japan  taiwan and the rest of asia 
we supply step and repeat photolithography systems based on one to one imaging technology 
within the integrated circuit industry  we target the market for advanced packaging applications 
within the nanotechnology industry  our target markets include thin film head magnetic recording devices  optical networking devices  laser diodes and light emitting diodes leds 
our laser thermal processing equipment is targeted at advanced annealing applications within the semiconductor industry 
in  as part of our continuing efforts to reduce company wide expenses  we eliminated approximately full time positions  in the united states and internationally 
we expect these activities to be completed by the second quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventories  warranty obligations  purchase order commitments  bad debts  income taxes  restructuring liabilities  asset retirement obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have reviewed these policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue from four sources system sales  spare parts sales  service contracts and license fees 
provided all other criteria are met  we recognize revenues on system sales when we have received customer acceptance of the system 
in the event that terms of the sale provide for a lapsing customer acceptance period  we recognize revenue upon the expiration of the lapsing acceptance period or customer acceptance  whichever occurs first 
in these instances  which are infrequent  revenue is recorded only if the product has met product specifications prior to shipment and management deems that no significant uncertainties as to product performance exist 
our transactions frequently include the sale of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
in situations with multiple deliverables  revenue is recognized upon the delivery of the separate elements and when we receive customer acceptance or are otherwise released from our customer acceptance obligations 
consideration from multiple element arrangements is allocated among the separate accounting units based on the residual method under which the revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on fair value of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue allocated to delivered elements  provided the undelivered elements have value on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements  the arrangement does not include a general right of return relative to the delivered item and delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the maximum revenue recognized on a delivered element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items 
we generally recognize revenue from spare parts sales upon shipment  as our products are generally sold on terms that transfer title and risk of ownership when it leaves our site 
we sell service contracts for which revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period for time based service contracts or as service hours are delivered for contracts based on a purchased quantity of hours 
we recognize license revenue from transactions in which our systems are re sold by our customers to third parties 
in addition  we recognize revenue from licensing and technology support agreements ratably over the contract period  or the estimated useful life of the licensed technologies  whichever is shorter 
costs related to deferred product revenues are capitalized deferred and recognized at the time of revenue recognition 
deferred product revenue and costs are netted on our balance sheet  under the caption deferred product and services income 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of sales 
inventories and purchase order commitments the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements and market conditions 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at lower of cost or market 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  product mix or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be written down  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of sales at the time of such determination 
for example  if the demand assumption used in our assessment at december  was reduced by  assuming all other assumptions such as product mix are kept the same and that mitigation efforts were not possible  we would have had to write down our inventory and open purchase commitments by  conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our gross margin in that period will be favorably impacted 
during the year ended december   we recognized revenue from the sales of previously written down inventory which resulted in a favorable gross margin impact of million 
warranty obligations we recognize the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage rates and the efficiency by which the product failure is corrected 
should actual product failure rates  material usage rates and labor efficiencies differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required which could result in future charges or credits to our gross margins 
we believe our warranty accrual  as of december   will be sufficient to satisfy outstanding obligations as of that date 
allowance for bad debts we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is established based upon historical trends  current economic conditions  delinquency status based on contractual terms and an analysis of specific exposures 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or even a single customer was otherwise unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the average selling price of our systems is in excess of million 
accordingly  a single customer default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our bad debt reserve as a percentage of gross accounts receivable decreased from at december  to at december  due principally to the million change in estimate related to the collectibility of certain accounts receivable 
deferred income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets except those in japan and taiwan 
as of december   we had recorded approximately million of net foreign deferred tax assets related to our operations in japan and taiwan 
based on projected future pre tax income in japan and taiwan  these assets were not subject to a valuation allowance as it is more likely than not that they will be realized in the future 
stock based compensation beginning in fiscal  we have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r revised  share based payment sfas r as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense recognized in our results of operations could be materially affected 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
results of operations we derive a substantial portion of our total net sales from sales of a relatively small number of newly manufactured systems  which typically range in price from million to million 
as a result of these high sale prices  the timing and recognition of revenue from a single transaction has had and most likely will continue to have a significant impact on our net sales and operating results for any particular period 
our backlog at the beginning of a period typically does not include all of the sales needed to achieve our sales objectives for that period 
in addition  orders in backlog are subject to cancellation  shipment or customer acceptance delays  and deferral or rescheduling by a customer with limited or no penalties 
consequently  our net sales and operating results for a period have been and will continue to be dependent upon our obtaining orders for systems to be shipped and accepted in the same period in which the order is received 
our business and financial results for a particular period could be materially adversely affected if an anticipated order for even one system is not received in time to permit shipment and customer acceptance during that period 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our shipments has historically occurred near the end of each quarter 
delays in installation and customer acceptance due  for example  to our inability to successfully demonstrate the agreed upon specifications or criteria at the customer s facility  or to the failure of the customer to permit installation of the system in the agreed upon time  may cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below our expectations  which may materially adversely affect our operating results for that period 
this risk is especially applicable in connection with the introduction and initial sales of a new product line 
additionally  the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments due  for example  to rescheduling  delays  deferrals or cancellations by customers  additional customer configuration requirements  or to unexpected manufacturing difficulties or delays in deliveries by suppliers due to their long production lead times or otherwise  have caused and may continue to cause net sales in a particular period to fall significantly below our expectations  materially adversely affecting our operating results for that period 
in particular  the long manufacturing and acceptance cycles of our advanced packaging family of wafer steppers and laser thermal processing systems and the long lead time for lenses and other materials  could cause shipments and acceptances of such products to be delayed from one quarter to the next  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for a particular quarter 
additionally  the need for continued expenditures for research and development  capital equipment  ongoing training and worldwide customer service and support  among other factors  will make it difficult for us to reduce our operating expenses in a particular period if we fail to achieve our net sales goals for the period 
net sales vs 
amount of percentage in millions change change sales of systems spare parts services licenses total net sales net sales consist of revenues from system sales  spare parts sales  services and licensing of technologies 
for the year ended december   systems revenue accounted for approximately of total net sales  and services  licenses and spare parts accounted for the remaining 
system sales decreased to million on a system unit volume decrease of 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in the average selling price of systems sold in compared to the system unit volume decrease was due primarily to postponement of capital expenditures by our customers and timing difference of system acceptances by our customers 
the average selling price of systems sold increased from the prior year primarily as a result of a shift in product mix in favor of our laser processing products and away from our legacy platform products and refurbished units 
in  refurbished systems accounted for approximately of units sold as compared to of units sold in this percentage can fluctuate from year to year and  as refurbished units generally have lower average selling prices than new units  any such fluctuation will impact the weighted average selling price of the systems sold 
at december   we had approximately million of deferred product and services income resulting from products shipped but not yet installed and accepted  as compared with million at december  the increase was primarily due to timing difference 
in general  it takes about two to three months to install and receive customer acceptance 
on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry were million for the year ended december   a decrease of as compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in advanced packaging application sales 
system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with sales of million in system sales to the nanotechnology market are highly dependent on customer capacity demand in the thin film head industry 
sales of spare parts in decreased  to million  as compared to million in this decrease was mainly due to decreased spare part usage 
sales from services grew to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in service contracts entered into in licensing and licensing support arrangements declined to million in as compared with million in future revenues from licensing activities  if any  will be contingent upon existing and future licensing arrangements 
we may not be successful in generating licensing revenues and do not anticipate the recognition of significant levels of licensing income in the future 
for the year ended december   international net sales were million  or of total net sales  as compared with million  or of total net sales in we expect sales to international customers to continue to represent a significant majority of our revenues during as companies continue to build manufacturing plants overseas  especially in asia 
our revenue derived from sales in foreign countries is not generally subject to significant exchange rate fluctuations  principally because sales contracts for our systems are generally denominated in us dollars 
in japan  however  orders are often denominated in japanese yen 
for the year ended december   we recorded system sales in japan of million  of which were denominated in japanese yen 
this subjects us to the risk of currency fluctuations 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by entering into foreign currency forward exchange contracts for the period between when an order is received and when it is recorded as revenue 
after recording revenue  we use various mechanisms  such as natural hedges  to offset substantial portions of the gains or losses associated with our japanese yen denominated receivables due to exchange rate fluctuations 
we had approximately million of japanese yen denominated receivables at december  international sales expose us to a number of additional risks  including fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the us dollar  which impact the relative cost of ownership of our products and  thus  the customer s willingness to purchase our product

system sales decreased to million on a system unit volume decrease of 
this decrease was partially offset by a increase in the average selling price of systems sold in compared to the revenue decrease was due primarily to delivery push outs in the fourth quarter of  reflecting softer business conditions 
the average selling price of systems sold increased from the prior year primarily as a result of a shift in product mix in favor of our new laser processing products and away from our legacy platform products and refurbished units 
in  refurbished systems accounted for approximately of units sold as compared to of units sold in this percentage can fluctuate from year to year and  as refurbished units generally have lower average selling prices than new units  any such fluctuation will impact the weighted average selling price of the systems sold 
on a product market application basis  system sales to the semiconductor industry were million for the year ended december   an increase of as compared with system sales of million in this increase was due to a increase in laser thermal processing system sales 
these systems typically have significantly higher average selling prices  as compared to our nanotechnology offerings 
system sales to the nanotechnology market were million for the year ended december   a decrease of as compared with sales of million in system sales to the nanotechnology market are highly dependent on customer capacity demand in the thin film head industry 
sales of spare parts in increased  to million  as compared to million in this increase was mainly due to increased spare part usage as the result of system upgrades revenue increase in as compared to revenues from services grew to million for the year ended december  as compared with million in the increase in service revenue was primarily due to an increase in service provided as the result of system upgrades and additional service contracts entered into in licensing and licensing support arrangements declined to million in as compared with million in in  we recognized license revenue of million 
in  we recognized million of amortization revenue from prior period licensing agreements and million of revenue from licensing agreements 
future revenues from licensing activities  if any  will be contingent upon existing and future licensing and royalty arrangements  including those  if any  resulting from litigation 
we may not be successful in generating licensing revenues and do not anticipate the recognition of significant levels of licensing income in the future

on a comparative basis  gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the percentage point increase in gross margin in was mainly due to lower warranty and installation costs related to our laser spike annealing systems compared to points  a change in our product mix in favor of our laser processing products and away from our legacy product platforms points  lower inventory write downs points  our continuing effort to reduce company wide expenses during points   sale of previously written down inventory points and lower fringe benefits expense resulting from a refund of employee health insurance premiums that we paid in prior periods points 
these lower costs were partially offset by our higher manufacturing overhead costs resulting from lower plant utilization in points 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales has been and most likely will continue to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products sold  the introduction of new products  which typically have higher manufacturing  installation and after sale support costs until efficiencies are realized and which are typically discounted more than existing products until the products gain market acceptance  the rate of capacity utilization  write downs of inventory and open purchase commitments  product discounts  pricing and competition in our targeted markets  non linearity of shipments during the quarter which can result in manufacturing inefficiencies  and the percentage of international sales  which typically have lower gross margins than domestic sales principally due to higher field service and support costs 
vs 
on a comparative basis  gross margins were and for and  respectively 
the percentage point decline in gross margin in was mainly due to higher unabsorbed manufacturing expenses points  higher unabsorbed service expenses points and higher inventory write downs points partially offset by higher standard margin points due to changes in revenue mix resulting primarily from laser thermal processing systems and ap systems accepted during as compared with laser thermal processing systems and ap systems in the remaining points are due to other miscellaneous charges  each of which individually is insignificant 
exclusive of licensing revenues  gross margin was for as compared with for we believe disclosure of gross margins without reference to licensing revenues provides additional appropriate disclosure to allow comparison of our product and service gross margins over time because there is little  if any  cost of sales associated with our licensing revenues 
research  development and engineering expenses vs

these reductions were offset in part by an increase of million in engineering expenses 
given that there is an inherent delay between the time product development activities and expenditures occur and when resultant product revenue is ultimately realized  we expect current year research  development and engineering investments to contribute to revenue in future years 
as a percentage of net sales  research  development and engineering expenses for the year ended december  were compared to for vs

the decrease in from was primarily due to lower interest rates on our investments 
the increase in from was primarily due to higher interest rates on our investments 
we presently maintain an investment portfolio with a weighted average maturity of approximately years 
consequently  changes in short term interest rates have a significant impact on our interest income 
future changes in short term interest rates are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our interest income 
provision for income taxes for each of the years ended december   an  we recorded income tax expense of million  million and million  respectively  comprised primarily of foreign taxes 
the actual expense recorded for each of   and differs from the federal tax benefit at primarily due to current tax expense in foreign jurisdictions and the fact that the tax benefit of us losses is not recognized 
income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether  and within which jurisdictions  future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the united states  combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters and we do not anticipate any material earnings impact from their ultimate resolutions 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin as of january  prior to the adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
the effects of final resolution  if any  were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and de recognition of uncertain tax positions 
fin permits us to recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 
as a result of the adoption  we recorded a  decrease to accrued taxes payable  a  decrease to accumulated deficit and a  net increase to deferred tax assets at the beginning of we also reported accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
during  an additional fin net reserve of  was recorded 
due to our full valuation allowance in the united states  only  of the incremental reserve was recorded through the tax provision line 
over the next twelve months  we expect a decline of approximately  in the estimated amount of liabilities associated with our uncertain tax positions which arose prior to december  as a result of expiring statutes of limitations in certain foreign jurisdictions 
if we are able to eventually recognize these uncertain tax positions  million and million of the unrecognized benefit on january  and december   respectively  would reduce the effective tax rate 
we currently have a full valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax asset which would impact the timing of the effective tax rate benefit should any of these uncertain tax positions be favorably settled in the future 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
as of december   we had accrued approximately  of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions 
we are subject to federal and state tax examination for years forward and forward  respectively  by virtue of the tax attributes carrying forward from those years 
we are also subject to audits in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate for years and forward 
there are no income tax examinations currently in progress 
cumulative effect of the adoption of fin in december we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 asset retirement obligations sfas 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in sfas refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated  even if conditional on a future event 
as permitted  we recognized the effect of applying fin as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
our adoption of fin in resulted in an increase in net equipment and leasehold improvements of approximately million  recognition of an asset retirement obligation the aro liability of million  and a cumulative effect of adoption of million or per share  for the year ended december  the aro liability is principally for estimable asset retirement obligations related to remediation costs  which we estimate will be incurred upon the expiration of certain operating leases 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements herein for further disclosures related to this 
outlook the anticipated timing of orders  shipments and customer acceptances usually requires that we fill a number of production slots in any given quarter in order to meet our sales targets 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to secure those production orders  or if existing production orders are delayed or cancelled  our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted 
accordingly  we may not be able to achieve or maintain our current or prior level of sales 
we presently expect that net sales for will increase to from the level of net sales reported in of million 
because our net sales are subject to a number of risks  including risks associated with the market acceptance of our new laser processing product line  delays in customer acceptance  intense competition in the capital equipment industry  uncertainty relating to the timing and market acceptance of our products  and the condition of the macro economy and the semiconductor industry and the other risks described in this report  we may not exceed or maintain our current or prior level of net sales for any period in the future 
additionally  we believe that the market acceptance and volume production of our advanced packaging systems  laser processing systems  and our series family of wafer steppers are of critical importance to our future financial results 
at december   these critical systems represented of our backlog 
to the extent that these products do not achieve or maintain significant sales due to difficulties involving manufacturing or engineering  the inability to reduce the current long manufacturing cycles for these products  competition  excess capacity in the semiconductor or nanotechnology device industries  or for any other reason  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
we anticipate our operating income to be positive for we believe our cash flow for will continue to be positive 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   as compared with net cash used in operations of million for the comparable period in net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was attributable to a decrease in inventories of million due to sales  an increase in deferred product and services income of million due to timing difference  and adjustment of non cash charges of million to net loss primarily for depreciation  amortization and accretion expenses  stock based compensation expense and loss on disposal of equipment  which were partially offset by a net loss of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  a decrease in advanced billings of million and a decrease in accrued and other liabilities of million 
we believe that because of the relatively long manufacturing cycle of certain of our systems  particularly newer products  our inventories will continue to represent a significant portion of working capital 
currently  we are devoting significant resources to the development  introduction and commercialization of our laser processing systems and to the development of our next generation x lithography technologies 
we currently intend to continue to incur significant operating expenses in the areas of research  development and engineering  manufacturing  and selling  general and administrative costs in order to further develop  produce and support these new products 
additionally  gross profit margins  inventory and capital equipment levels may be adversely impacted in the future by costs associated with the initial production of the laser processing systems and by future generations of our x wafer steppers 
these costs include  but are not limited to  additional manufacturing overhead  costs of demonstration systems and facilities and the establishment of additional after sales support organizations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that operating expenses will not increase  relative to sales  as a result of adding technical  marketing and administrative personnel  among other costs  to support our new products 
if we are unable to achieve significantly increased net sales or if our sales fall below expectations  our cash flow and operating results will be materially adversely affected until  among other factors  costs and expenses can be reduced 
our failure to achieve our sales targets for these new products could result in additional inventory write offs and asset impairment charges  either of which could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was million  attributable to net proceeds from the maturities of short and long term investments of million partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december   attributable to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option plans of million  partially offset by net repayment of our notes payable of million 
at december   we had working capital of million 
our principal source of liquidity at december  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  net of related borrowings under our line of credit 
in december  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a brokerage firm replacing a similar arrangement that we had with a different firm 
under the terms of this agreement  we may borrow funds at a cost equal to the current federal funds rate plus basis points ie as of december  
certain of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments secure but do not legally restrict borrowings outstanding under this facility 
funds are advanced to us under this facility based on pre determined advance rates on the cash and securities held by us in this brokerage account 
this agreement has no set expiration date and there are no loan covenants 
as of december   million was outstanding under this facility  with a related collateral requirement of approximately million of our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as of december   million was outstanding under the facility  with a related collateral requirement of approximately million of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
on september   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock in the open market at then prevailing market prices during the period commencing september  through september  as of december   we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock under the program at a total purchase price of million 
we did not repurchase any common stock during the stock repurchase program ended on september  the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods less than after in millions total year years years years notes payable obligations non cancelable capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations long term payables asset retirement obligations open purchase order commitments total contractual cash obligations sublessor agreement net the amounts shown in the table above for open purchase order commitments are primarily related to the purchase of inventories  equipment and leasehold improvements 
we record charges to operations for purchase order commitments we deem in excess of normal operating requirements see critical accounting policies and estimates 
the development and manufacture of new lithography systems and enhancements are highly capital intensive 
in order to be competitive  we believe we must continue to make significant expenditures for capital equipment  sales  service  training and support capabilities  systems  procedures and controls  and expansion of operations and research and development  among many other items 
we expect that cash generated from operations and our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  in the near term  we may continue to utilize existing and future lines of credit  and other sources of financing  in order to maintain our present levels of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
beyond the next twelve months  we may require additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital or capital equipment needs 
in addition  we may seek to raise equity or debt capital at any time that we deem market conditions to be favorable 
additional financing  if needed  may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
we may in the future pursue additional acquisitions of complementary product lines  technologies or businesses 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expenses and impairment charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies  personnel and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
in the event we acquire product lines  technologies or businesses which do not complement our business  or which otherwise do not enhance our sales or operating results  we may incur substantial write offs and higher recurring operating costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that any such acquisition does occur  there can be no assurance as to the effect thereof on our business or operating results 
off balance sheet transactions our off balance sheet transactions consist of certain financial guarantees  both expressed and implied  related to indemnification for product liability  patent infringement and latent product defects 
other than liabilities recorded pursuant to known product defects  at december   we did not record a liability associated with these guarantees  as we have little or no history of costs associated with such indemnification requirements 
see note foreign currency as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we attempt to hedge most of our japanese yen denominated foreign currency exposures 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that outstanding japanese yen denominated receipts from customers  for actual or forecasted sales of equipment after receipt of customer orders  may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and natural hedges to offset substantial portions of the potential gains or losses associated with our japanese yen denominated assets and liabilities due to exchange rate fluctuations 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that generally have maturities of nine months or less 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to potential changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consisted primarily of fixed interest rate instruments as of december  and we maintain an investment policy designed to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting market risk and the risk of default 
certain of our cash  cash equivalents and investments serve as collateral for a line of credit we maintain with a brokerage firm 
the line of credit is used for liquidity purposes  mitigating the need to liquidate investments in order to meet our current operating cash requirements 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in the financial instruments held by us at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
these instruments are comprised of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
these instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling techniques used measure the change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in interest rates 
assumed market value changes to our portfolio reflects immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps cash equivalents and valuation of securities valuation of securities available for sale given an interest rate no change in given an interest rate investments decrease of x basis points interest rate increase of x basis points in thousands bps bps bps bps bps bps bps us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies us corporate debt securities money market funds and commercial papers total investments during  we did not materially alter our investment objectives or criteria and believe that  although the composition of our portfolio has changed from the preceding year  the portfolio s sensitivity to changes in interest rates is materially the same 
credit risk we mitigate credit default risk by attempting to invest in high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity and is diversified in accordance with our investment policy 
to date  we have not experienced significant liquidity problems with our portfolio 
our largest holding at december   excluding the united states government and its agencies  was million 
we intend to closely monitor developments in the credit markets and make appropriate changes to our investment policy as deemed necessary 
based on our ability to liquidate our investment portfolio and our expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate any liquidity constraints as a result of the current credit environment 
foreign exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into these transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates we have established cash flow and balance sheet hedging programs 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the risk that outstanding japanese yen denominated receipts from customers for actual or forecasted sales of equipment may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always entirely eliminate  the impact of currency movements
