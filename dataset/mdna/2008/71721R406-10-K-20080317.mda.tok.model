fiscal year our fiscal year ends on december reference to  for example  refers to the fiscal year ended december  acquisitions from time to time we have expanded our product and service offerings through the acquisition of other businesses or technologies 
the most significant of these transactions are the acquisitions of clinsoft corporation and lincoln technologies  inc we also recently completed the acquisition of green mountain logic  inc these transactions are described below 
green mountain logic on october   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of green mountain logic  inc green mountain  a process automation software company that provides targeted solutions for the life sciences industry  including the labpas phase i clinic automation software 
the acquired technology and products of green mountain provide us with a solution targeted for phase i clinical trials

clinsoft corporation on august   we acquired clinsoft corporation clinsoft  a developer  marketer and provider of clinical data management and adverse event reporting and tracking products and services 
clinsoft s products consisted of clintrial and clintrace now empirica trace 
litigation settlement in february   we entered into a settlement agreement and related license agreement with dr 
mark l 
kozam d b a mlk software and datasci  llc 
the settlement agreement relates to a lawsuit filed by datasci in alleging that certain of our products and services and certain products and services of one of our customers  quintiles  inc  infringe a united states patent claimed to be owned by datasci 
under the settlement agreement and related license agreement  we agreed to make a one time  lump sum payment to datasci in the amount of million to settle the claim and obtain a perpetual  irrevocable  fully paid worldwide  non exclusive license to the patent that was the subject of the claim by datasci 
the confidential settlement  in which neither party admits liability  provides for mutual releases and dismissal of all actions between the parties 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we reviewed the attributes of the license obtained and estimated that the license obtained had no value or useful life and that the license would not contribute to our future cash flows  either directly or indirectly 
in addition we do not anticipate changing any of our products as a result of the license to this patent 
as such  the settlement amount was recorded as a charge to operations 
since the contingency existed as of december  and the settlement was concluded prior to the issuance of our audited consolidated financial statements  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we recorded the impact of the settlement in as a charge to operations 
the settlement was paid during the first quarter of fiscal sources of revenues we derive our revenues from software licenses and services 
our product line is comprised of three general categories that include the following software products electronic data capture edc inform  our internet based electronic data capture solution for collection and transmission of patient information in clinical trials  and labpas  our system for phase i clinic automation 
clinical data management clintrial  our clinical data management solution  and websdm  our system for validating and reviewing clinical trial data represented in formats meeting industry standards  such as those established by the clinical data interchange standards consortium  or cdisc 
safety empirica trace formerly clintrace  our adverse event management solution for monitoring drug safety and reporting adverse events that occur during and after conclusion of the clinical trial process  webvdme  our data mining and signal detection solution for post marketing data  and ctsd  our signal detection solution for data from clinical trials 
license revenues are derived principally from the sale of term licenses for our software products 
service revenues are derived principally from our delivery of the hosted solution of our inform  webvdme  ctsd and websdm software products  and consulting services and customer support  including training  for all of our products 
we generally recognize revenues ratably over the life of a license or service contract 
this allows us to maintain a backlog that provides multi year visibility in revenues 
one customer  glaxosmithkline  accounted for approximately and of our total revenues in the years and  respectively  and million and million of accounts receivable outstanding as of december  and  respectively 
our top customers accounted for approximately and of our total revenues  net of reimbursable out of pocket expenses  in the years and  respectively 
license revenues we derive our license revenues principally from the sale of term licenses for the following software products inform  our internet based electronic data capture  or edc  solution  clintrial and websdm  our clinical data management solutions  our drug safety solutions  including our empirica trace  webvdme and ctsd products  and our labpas phase i clinic automation solution 
although each of our software solutions is available as a stand alone enterprise application  we offer integrated enterprise solutions incorporating certain of our electronic data capture  data management and drug safety products 
license revenues for our inform electronic data capture software solution  either on a stand alone or integrated basis  are determined primarily by the number  complexity and duration of the clinical trials and the number of participants in each clinical trial 
license revenues for our clintrial  websdm  empirica trace  webvdme  ctsd and labpas software solutions are determined primarily by the number of users accessing the software solution 
except as discussed below  we enter into software license agreements for our inform  clintrial and empirica trace products with terms generally of three to five years with payment terms generally annually in advance 
license agreements for our other products are generally annual or multi year with payment terms generally annually in advance 
license revenues are recognized ratably over the duration of the software term license agreement  to the extent that amounts are fixed or determinable and collectable 
following our acquisition of clinsoft in august  we began converting holders of clinsoft perpetual software licenses to our software term license arrangements 
we continue to sell additional perpetual licenses of these products in certain situations to our existing customers with the option to purchase customer support  and may in the future do so for new customers based on customer requirements or market conditions 
we recognize revenues on the perpetual licenses upon delivery of the software when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we continue to provide and charge for maintenance and support on our products to those customers who do not convert to our software term license arrangements 
we will continue our efforts to convert the remaining former clinsoft customer base to software term license arrangements 
however  we anticipate that some customers will not convert and instead will continue to make annual customer support payments 
service revenues application hosting services 
in addition to making our software products available to customers through licenses  we offer our inform  webvdme  ctsd and websdm software as hosted application solutions delivered through a standard web browser  with customer support and training services 
service revenues from application hosting services are derived principally from our inform hosted solution 
revenues resulting from the inform hosting service consist of three stages for each clinical trial first stage trial and application set up  including design of electronic case report forms and edit checks  installation and server configuration of the system  second stage application hosting and related support services  and third stage services required to close out  or lock  the database for the clinical trial 
services provided for the first and third stages are provided on a fixed fee basis depending upon the complexity of the trial and system requirements 
services for the second stage are charged separately as a fixed monthly fee 
we recognize revenues from all stages of the hosting service ratably over the hosting period 
fees charged and costs incurred for the trial system design  set up and implementation are deferred until the start of the hosting period and are amortized and recognized ratably over the estimated hosting period 
the deferred costs include direct costs related to the trial and application set up 
fees for the first and third stages of the services are billed based upon milestones 
fees for application hosting and related services in the second stage are generally billed quarterly in advance 
bundled into this revenue element are the revenues attributable to the software license used by the customer 
in the event that an application hosting customer cancels a clinical trial and its related statement of work  all deferred revenues are recognized and all deferred set up costs are expensed 
in addition  certain termination related fees may be charged and if so  such fees are recognized in the period of termination 
revenues resulting from hosting services for our webvdme  ctsd and websdm products consist of installation and server configuration  application hosting and related support services 
services for this offering are charged monthly as a fixed fee 
revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the service 
in addition  application hosting service revenues include hosting services associated with term license customers and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
consulting services 
consulting services include the design and documentation of the processes related to our customers use of our products and services in their clinical trials and safety monitoring activities 
consulting services also include project planning and management services  guidance on best practices in using our software products  data management and configuration services for data mining and reporting  as well as implementation services consisting of application architecture design  systems integration  installation and validation 
consulting services can be sold on a stand alone basis or as part of a bundled arrangement 
in some circumstances  we sell additional follow on consulting services to a customer at a later date even if the customer purchased consulting services at the time of the initial license purchase under a bundled arrangement 
revenues from consulting services included in either a multiple element software license agreement or in an application hosting agreement are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
the value of our consulting services sold within a bundled arrangement is equal to the value of consulting services sold on a stand alone basis  as the activities performed under both types of arrangements are similar in nature 
the associated costs are expensed as incurred 
revenues from consulting services that are not included in a multiple element software license arrangement or an application hosting arrangement are recognized as services are performed 
fixed priced arrangements are billed based upon contractual milestones  and time and materials arrangements are billed monthly 
customer support 
we have a multinational services organization to support our software products and hosted solutions worldwide 
customer support includes training services  telephone support and software maintenance 
we bundle customer support in our software term licenses and allocate of the value of the license to customer support revenues 
the customer support services rate of for multi year term based licenses reflects a significant discount from the rate for customer support services associated with perpetual licenses due to the reduction in the time period during which the customer can utilize the upgrades and enhancements 
we believe this rate is substantive and represents an amount we believe reasonable to be allocated 
our customer support revenues also consist of customer support fees paid by perpetual license customers 
customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the customer support or term license agreement  with payment terms generally annually in advance 
cost of revenues and operating expenses we allocate overhead expenses such as rent and occupancy charges and employee benefit costs to all departments based on headcount 
as such  general overhead expenses are reflected in cost of service revenues and in the sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expense categories 
cost of revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of the amortization of royalties paid for certain modules within our clintrial software product as well as our inform software product 
in addition  costs of revenues include expense for the amortization of acquired technologies associated with the acquisition of lincoln 
the cost of license revenues vary based upon the mix of revenues from software licenses for our products 
we operate our service organization on a global basis as one distinct unit  and do not segment costs for our various service revenue elements 
these services include performing application hosting  consulting and customer support services 
costs for these services consist primarily of employee related costs associated with these services  amortization of the deferred clinical trial set up costs  allocated overhead  outside contractors  royalties associated with providing customer support for use with the clintrial and inform software products and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
cost of services also includes hosting costs that primarily consist of hosting facility fees and server depreciation 
the cost of service revenue varies based upon the number of employees in the service organization  the type of work performed  and royalties associated with revenues derived from providing customer support  as well as costs associated with the flexible use of outside contractors to support internal resources 
we supplement the trial design and set up activity for our inform application hosting services through the use of outside contractors 
this allows us to utilize outside contractors in those periods where trial design and set up activity is highest while reducing the use of outside contractors in those periods where trial activity lessens  allowing for a more flexible delivery model 
the percentage of the services workforce represented by outside contractors varies from period to period depending on the volume of specific support required 
the cost of services is significantly higher as a percentage of revenues as compared to our cost of license revenues primarily due to the employee related and outside contractor expenses associated with providing services 
gross margin 
our gross margin on license revenues varies based on the mix of royalty and non royalty bearing license revenues and the amount of amortization of acquired technologies 
our gross margin on service revenues varies primarily due to variations in the utilization levels of the professional service team and the timing of expense and revenue recognition under our service arrangements 
in situations where the service revenues are recognized ratably over the software license term our costs associated with delivery of the services are recognized as the services are performed  which is typically during the first to months of the contract period 
accordingly  our gross margin on service revenues will vary significantly over the life of a contract due to the timing  amount and type of service required in delivering certain projects 
in addition  consolidated gross margin will vary depending upon the mix of license and service revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  including travel  marketing programs which include product marketing expenses such as trade shows  workshops and seminars  corporate communications  other brand building and advertising  allocated overhead and the amortization of commissions 
in addition  sales and marketing include expense for the amortization of acquired technologies associated with the acquisition of lincoln 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as commission expense increases with our revenues and as we continue to expand sales coverage and to build brand awareness through what we believe are the most cost effective channels available  but may fluctuate quarter over quarter due to the timing of marketing programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  allocated overhead and outside contractors 
we focus our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality  performance and integration of our software products 
we expect that in the future  research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to add features and functionality to our products  introduce additional integrated software solutions to our product suite and expand our product and service offering 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  professional fees  primarily consisting of expenses for accounting  compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  and legal services  including litigation  information technology and other corporate expenses and allocated overhead 
we expect that in the future our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
restructuring 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in which related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
this charge includes approximately million relating to the estimated future obligation under the non cancelable lease and an approximate million write off of the related abandoned leasehold improvements and fixed assets 
as of march   payments for all remaining expenses were completed and as a result we recorded a restructuring benefit of  representing the elimination of accrued expenses associated with the restructuring charge 
in process research and development 
in process research and development expense represents product development efforts that were under way at green mountain at the time of acquisition for which technological feasibility had not yet been established 
technological feasibility is established when either of the following criteria is met detailed program design has been completed  documented and traced to product specifications and its high risk development issues have been resolved  or a working model of the product has been finished and determined to be complete and consistent with the product design 
as of the date of the acquisition  green mountain had not completed product designs or working models for the in process technology  and we determined that there was no future alternative use for the technologies beyond the stated purpose of the specific research and development projects 
the fair value of the in process research and development effort was  therefore  expensed at the time of the acquisition 
the estimated fair market value was determined using a discounted cash flow model  based on a discount rate which took into consideration the nature of the expected product to be developed  history of successful new product introduction  and the project s relatively short development time 
key assumptions used in the in process research and development valuation consisted of the expected completion date for the in process project  revenue and expense projections assuming future release of the product  and a risk adjusted discount rate 
stock based compensation expenses 
our cost of service revenues  sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses include stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense is the fair value of outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards  which are recognized over the respective stock option and award service periods 
it also includes amortization of the excess of the deemed fair market value over the exercise price of stock options granted prior to when we became a public company 
during the years  and  we recorded  million and million of aggregate stock based compensation expense  respectively 
foreign currency translation with regard to our international operations  we frequently enter into transactions in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  our revenues  expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were generated in locations outside the united states 
the majority of these revenues are in currencies other than the us dollar  as are many of the associated expenses 
in periods when the us dollar declines in value as compared to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business  our foreign currency based revenues and expenses generally increase in value when translated into us dollars 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions with our audit committee  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred set up costs  commissions and royalties  accounts receivable reserves  stock based compensation expense  long lived assets  intangibles assets and goodwill  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented in this annual report 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition and deferred set up costs 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  while revenues resulting from application services are recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware and securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
on august   we adopted eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
customers generally have the ability to terminate application hosting  consulting and training service agreements upon days notice 
license agreements  multiple element arrangements  including license and services agreements and certain application hosting services can generally be terminated by either party for material breach of obligations not corrected within days after notice of the breach 
we recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product or service has been provided to the customer  the collection of our fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
we generally enter into software term licenses for our inform  clintrial and empirica trace products with our customers for to year periods 
license agreements for our other products are generally annual or multi year terms 
these arrangements typically include multiple elements software license  consulting services and customer support 
we bill our customers in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract 
generally  we bill license fees annually in advance for each year of the license term 
our payment terms are generally net days 
our software license revenues are earned from the sale of off the shelf software requiring no significant modification or customization subsequent to delivery to the customer 
consulting services  which can also be performed by third party consultants  are deemed to be non essential to the functionality of the software and typically are for trial configuration  implementation planning  loading of software  building simple interfaces and running test data and documentation of procedures 
customer support includes training services  telephone support and software maintenance 
we generally bundle customer support with the software license for the entire term of the arrangement 
as a result  we generally recognize revenues for all elements  including consulting services  ratably over the term of the software license and support arrangement 
we allocate the revenues recognized for these arrangements to the different elements based on management s estimate of the relative fair value of each element 
for our term based licenses  we allocate to consulting services the anticipated service effort and value throughout the term of the arrangement at an amount that would have been allocated had those services been sold separately to the customer 
the value of our consulting services sold within a bundled arrangement is equal to the value of consulting services sold on a stand alone basis  as the activities performed under both types of arrangements are similar in nature 
the remaining value is allocated to license and support services  with of this amount allocated to support services 
the customer support services rate of for multi year term based licenses reflects a significant discount from the rate for customer support services associated with perpetual licenses due to the reduction in the time period during which the customer can utilize the upgrades and enhancements 
we believe this rate is substantive and represents a reasonable basis of allocation 
we have allocated the estimated fair value to our multiple element arrangements to provide meaningful disclosures about each of our revenue streams 
the costs associated with the consulting and customer support services are expensed as incurred 
there are instances in which we sell software licenses based on usage levels 
these software licenses can be based on estimated usage  in which case the license fee charged to the customer is fixed based on this estimate 
when the fee is fixed  the revenues are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement 
if the fee is based on actual usage  and therefore variable  the revenues are recognized in the period of use 
revenues from certain follow on consulting services  which are sold separately to customers with existing software licenses and are not considered part of a multiple element arrangement  are recognized as the services are performed 
we continue to sell additional perpetual licenses for the clintrial and empirica trace software products in certain situations to our existing customers with the option to purchase customer support and may in the future do so for new customers based on customer requirements or market conditions 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the customer support 
accordingly  license revenues are recognized upon delivery of the software and when all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
customer support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying support arrangement 
we continue to generate customer support and maintenance revenues from our perpetual license customer base 
training revenues are recognized as earned 
in addition to making our software products available to customers through licenses  we offer our inform  webvdme  ctsd and websdm software solutions through a hosted application solution delivered through a standard web browser 
revenues resulting from inform application hosting services consist of three stages for each clinical trial the first stage involves application set up  including design of electronic case report forms and edit checks  implementation of the system and server configuration  the second stage involves application hosting and related support services  and the third stage involves services required to close out  or lock  the database for the clinical trial 
services provided for the first and third stages are provided on a fixed fee basis based upon the complexity of the trial and system requirements 
services for the second stage are charged separately as a fixed monthly fee 
we recognize revenues from all stages of the inform hosting service ratably over the hosting period 
fees charged and costs incurred for the trial system design  set up and implementation are deferred as applicable  until the start of the hosting period and then amortized and recognized  as applicable  ratably over the estimated hosting period 
the deferred costs include incremental direct costs with third parties and certain internal direct costs related to the trial and application set up  as defined under sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and indirect costs of leases 
these costs include salary and benefits associated with direct labor costs incurred during trial set up  as well as third party subcontract fees and other contract labor costs 
work performed outside the original scope of work is contracted for separately as an additional fee and is generally recognized ratably over the remaining term of the hosting period 
fees for the first and third stages of the services are billed based upon milestones 
fees for application hosting and related services in the second stage are billed quarterly in advance 
bundled into this revenue element are the revenues attributable to the software license used by the customer 
revenues resulting from hosting services for our webvdme  ctsd and websdm products consist of installation and server configuration  application hosting and related support services 
services for this offering are charged monthly as a fixed fee 
revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the service 
in the event that an application hosting customer cancels a clinical trial and its related statement of work  all deferred revenues are recognized and all deferred set up costs are expensed 
in addition  certain termination related fees may be charged and if so  such fees are recognized in the period of termination 
we deferred million  million and million of set up costs and amortized million  million and million of set up costs during the years  and  respectively 
the amortization of deferred set up costs is a component of cost of services 
deferred revenues represent amounts billed or cash received in advance of revenue recognition 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made on a contract by contract basis and are recognized in the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  we have not experienced any material losses on uncompleted application hosting contracts 
accounting for prepaid sales commissions and royalties 
for arrangements where we recognize revenues over the relevant contract period  we defer related commission payments to our direct sales force and software license royalties paid to third parties and amortize these amounts over the same period that the related revenues are recognized 
this is done to better match commission and royalty expenses with the related revenues 
commission payments are nonrefundable unless amounts due from a customer are determined to be uncollectible or if the customer subsequently changes or terminates the level of service  in which case commissions which were paid are recoverable by the company 
we deferred million  million and million of commissions and amortized to sales and marketing expense million  million and million during the years  and  respectively 
royalties are paid on a percentage of billings basis for certain of our products  and we have the right to recover royalties in the event an arrangement is cancelled 
we deferred million  million and million of royalties and amortized to cost of revenues million  million and million during the years  and  respectively 
accounts receivable reserve 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors  which may include dialogue with the customer to determine the cause of non payment  the use of collection agencies  and or the use of litigation 
in the event it is determined that the customer may not be able to meet its full obligation to us  we record a specific allowance to reduce the related receivable to the amount that we expect to recover given all information available to us 
we continuously monitor collections from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our accounts receivable reserves were   and  as of december   and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions  and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which is the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
at the adoption date and as of december   we had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to liabilities or operations were required 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates 
this process requires that we project our current tax liability and estimate our deferred tax assets and liabilities  including net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our recent operating results  future taxable income projections and all prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize a portion of our deferred tax assets and therefore reduced the valuation allowance by million 
the benefit of the release in valuation allowance was realized through reductions to income tax expense of million and to goodwill of million 
in  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize an additional portion of our deferred tax asset and therefore reduced the valuation allowance by an additional million 
the benefit of the release in valuation allowance was realized through reductions to income tax expense of million and to goodwill of  in  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would realize the full value of our deferred tax asset and therefore reduced the valuation allowance by an additional million 
the benefit of the release in valuation allowance was realized through reductions to income tax expense of million and to goodwill of million 
accounting for stock based awards 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to recognize expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r and therefore have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted on or after march  the filing date for the initial registration statement for our initial public offering  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
stock options granted prior to march  are minimum value options pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the value of these options will not be recorded in the statement of income subsequent to the date of our adoption of sfas no 
r 
instead  we will continue to account for these options using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
for service based options accounted for under sfas no 
r  we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
for performance based options  we recognize expense over the estimated performance period 
in addition  sfas r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based compensation to be reported as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in the statements of cash flows 
this requirement can have the effect of reducing our net operating cash flows and increasing our net financing cash flows in certain periods 
to date  we have not recorded these benefits as they have not been realized 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied sfas no 
 amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which allowed companies to apply the existing accounting rules under apb opinion no 
pursuant to apb opinion no 
 we accounted for our stock based awards to employees using the intrinsic value method  under which compensation expense was measured on the date of grant as the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the option exercise price multiplied by the number of options granted 
generally  we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the estimated fair value of our common stock  however  to the extent that the fair value of the common stock exceeded the exercise price of stock options granted to employees on the date of grant  we recorded deferred compensation and amortized the expense over the vesting schedule of the options  generally four years 
during and  in accordance with apb opinion no 
 we recorded deferred stock based compensation resulting from the grant of employee stock options with an exercise price less than the fair value of common stock 
as of december   all of the deferred stock based compensation had been recognized 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
during and  we recorded and million of aggregate stock based compensation expense respectively  of which and million  respectively  was a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
the remaining stock based compensation expense is due to the amortization of stock based compensation associated with previously issued stock options which amounted to  and  in and  respectively

other significant estimates goodwill and intangible assets impairment 
we review the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets periodically based upon the expected future discounted operating cash flows of our business 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of our operating results in future periods 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
the timing and size of impairment charges  if any  involves the application of management s judgment regarding the estimates and could significantly affect our operating results

in addition  we had increases in both consulting services and customer support  totaling million 
the increase in safety revenues can be attributed to an increase in license revenues and consulting services revenues of million and  respectively

the services gross margin percentage decreased during as our expense increases outpaced our revenue growth 
these expense increases were due to investments we made to enhance our ability to manage additional current and future application service provider related business 
the overall gross margin percentage decreased in due to the decline in license revenue as a percentage of total revenues and the lower services gross margin percentage 
it is likely that gross margin  as a percentage of revenue  will fluctuate quarter by quarter due to the timing and mix of license and service revenues  and the type  amount and timing of service required in delivering certain projects 
operating expenses year ended december  change operating expenses amount percentage of revenues amount percentage of revenues amount in thousands sales and marketing    research and development    general and administrative    in process research and development nm total    not meaningful sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased in primarily due to a million increase in commission expense related to an increase in orders and revenues and in the effective commission rate  as well as due to a  increase in stock based compensation expense 
we also experienced increases in employee related expenses of  and in travel of  in addition  there were increases in marketing programs and outside contractor expense of  and  respectively 
we expect that our sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars as commission expense increases with our revenues and as we continue to expand sales coverage and to build brand awareness through what we believe are the most cost effective channels available 
we expect that such increases may fluctuate  however  due to the timing of marketing programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in primarily due to employee related expenses of million associated with a headcount increase of people 
there were also expense increases for outside contractors and stock based compensation expense of  and  respectively

in addition  there were also expense increases in taxes and fees  computer related expense  depreciation expense  and employee development expenses of    and  respectively 
computer related expenses include hardware and software support agreements as well as computer accessories 
these expense increases were partially offset by an overall decrease in professional fees of  which included  of expense related to an acquisition opportunity that was evaluated in  but which we did not pursue  as well as a decrease in bad debt expense of  we expect that in the future our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operations 
in process research and development 
in process research and development expenses were  in  resulting from the acquisition of green mountain 
in process research and development expense represents product development efforts that were under way at green mountain at the time of acquisition for which technological feasibility had not yet been established 
technological feasibility is established when either of the following criteria is met detailed program design has been completed  documented and traced to product specifications and its high risk development issues have been resolved  or a working model of the product has been finished and determined to be complete and consistent with the product design 
as of the date of the acquisition  green mountain had not completed product designs or working models for the in process technology  and we determined that there was no future alternative use for the technologies beyond the stated purpose of the specific research and development projects 
the fair value of the in process research and development effort was  therefore  expensed at the time of the acquisition

the services gross margin percentage increased during due to lower services expenses as a percentage of related revenues  due to increased efficiencies resulting in an increase in services revenue per services employee 
in addition  there was an increase in revenue from consulting services performed on a time and material basis for some of our enterprise customers  rather than services performed under bundled arrangements 
when services are performed on a time and material basis  the timing of expense and revenue recognition is more closely aligned than when services are performed under bundled arrangements  where the revenue is recognized ratably over the license period  while the expenses are recognized as incurred

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively  and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by and used in operating activities has historically been affected by changes in working capital accounts  primarily deferred revenues  accounts receivable and accrued expenses  and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation expense 
fluctuations within accounts receivable and deferred revenues are primarily related to the timing of billings of our term license customers and the associated revenue recognition 
movements in deferred costs are related to the volume and stages of hosted clinical trials and movements in accrued expenses and accounts payable are due to the timing of certain transactions 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  which was more than net income of million 
the difference is primarily due to non cash charges of depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation expense of million and increases in deferred revenue of million and accrued expenses of million 
these increases were partially offset by a non cash benefit of deferred income taxes of million  increases in accounts receivable of million and deferred costs of million  a decrease in accounts payable of million  and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million 
net cash used by investing activities was million during we received million of proceeds from the maturities of short term investments 
this increase was offset due to the purchase of short term investments of million  capital expenditures of million  and cash paid for business acquisitions of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  most of which consists of net proceeds from the offering of approximately million shares of common stock including shares sold upon the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option  which was completed in june at both december  and december   we had a  outstanding letter of credit related to our leased facilities 
the letter of credit reduces the amount available under our line of credit with a bank 
substantially all of our long lived assets as of december  and december  are located in the united states 
we generally do not enter into long term binding purchase commitments 
our principal commitments consist of obligations under non cancelable operating leases for office space 
the following table of our material contractual obligations as of december  summarizes the aggregate effect that these obligations are expected to have on our cash flows in the periods indicated payments due by period contractual obligations total year or less years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations     total     the above table does not include the new lease we entered into subsequent to december  on february   we entered into a lease lease with bp fourth avenue  llc the landlord to secure office space for our future corporate headquarters at fourth avenue  waltham  massachusetts 
the estimated commencement date for occupancy under the lease is december the lease for our current corporate headquarters at winter street in waltham is due to expire in february the lease provides for the rental of  rentable square feet of space and has an initial term of years and three months 
we can  subject to certain conditions  extend this term by exercising up to two consecutive five year options 
we are not required to pay any rent for the first three months of the initial lease term 
thereafter  the annual rent on the new lease for years one through five will be million  or approximately  per month 
for years six through ten  the annual rent will be million  or approximately  per month 
the total base rent payable in the initial term is million 
in addition to base rent  commencing on january   the lease requires us to pay our proportionate share of the amount by which defined operating expenses incurred by the landlord exceed the base year operating expenses  as defined in the lease 
the lease also requires us to pay our proportionate share of the amount by which real estate taxes paid or incurred by the landlord exceed the tax base year fiscal  as defined in the lease 
in addition  we will be receiving lease incentives  including free rent for the first three months of occupancy and allowances for tenant improvements 
in connection with the signing of the lease  we have deposited with the landlord an unconditional  irrevocable letter of credit in landlord s favor in the amount of  as of december  and  we had a working capital line of credit with a bank that enables us to borrow up to million 
as of december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under the working capital line of credit 
at december  and  there was million available under the line of credit and  reserved under a letter of credit associated with our leased facilities 
at december   we had million of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset future us federal taxable income 
these attributes may reduce our future cash tax liability 
in addition  we had million of net operating losses resulting from excess tax deductions related to stock based compensation 
we will realize the benefit of these excess tax deductions through increases to stockholders equity in the periods in which the losses are utilized to reduce tax payments 
in addition  we had million of federal research and development tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized to offset future us taxes 
the net operating loss and tax credit carryforward periods extend through and  respectively 
in addition  we had million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset future foreign taxable income 
these foreign net operating loss carryforwards have an unlimited carryforward period 
we also had million of research and development tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized to offset future massachusetts state taxable income 
the massachusetts tax credit carryforward period extends through the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits are subject to review and possible adjustment by the taxing authorities 
also  the internal revenue code contains provisions that may limit the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards available in any given year in the event of certain changes in the ownership interests of significant stockholders 
we currently expect to realize the benefit of recorded deferred tax assets as of december  of million 
our conclusion that such assets will be recovered is based upon our expectation that our future earnings combined with tax planning strategies available to us will provide sufficient taxable income to realize recorded tax assets 
we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information on unrecognized tax benefits  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
on april   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s  which the securities and exchange commission sec declared effective on may   with respect to the issuance of up to million aggregate principal amount of common stock 
one june   we completed an offering of million shares of common stock including shares sold upon the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option under this shelf registration statement which generated net proceeds of million 
we currently intend to use the estimated net proceeds from the sale of these securities for working capital and other general corporate purposes and possible acquisitions of other companies  products or technologies 
we may from time to time issue securities under the remaining balance of the shelf registration statement for general corporate purposes 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash provided by operating activities and our debt facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
from time to time  we may also enter into agreements with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
to the extent that existing cash and securities and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
included within our investment portfolio at december  were million of auction rate securities ars 
these ars are debt instruments issued by various states throughout the united states to finance student loans 
the types of ars that we own are backed by student loans  of which are guaranteed under the federal family education loan program  and all of which had credit ratings of aaa or equivalent from a recognized rating agency 
the ars are classified as available for sale in our consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report and are recorded at cost 
historically  the carrying value of ars approximated fair market value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates 
the auctions have provided a liquid market for these securities as investors historically could readily sell their investments at auction 
auctions are held every days 
following successful auctions in january  all of our ars have experienced failed auctions in february and march  as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders due to the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
as of march   we have liquidated million of the securities  and have classified these securities as current assets in our consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report as of december  as of march   the par value of the ars that we continue to own  which is equal to cost  totals million and these ars are classified as long term investments in the consolidated balance sheet at december   based on the our ability and intent to hold these securities until market conditions improve with successful auctions 
we believe that  based on our unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities balances of million at december   excluding ars of million  the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flow or our ability to fund our operations 
if in the future we determine that any decline in value of the ars is other than temporary  we would be required to recognize the loss in our statement of income  which could have a material impact on our operating results in the period it is recognized 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
became effective for the us in the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
sfas no 
r retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas no 
called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
this approach replaces sfas no 
s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r retains the guidance in sfas no 
for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas r will now require acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred  restructuring costs associated with a business combination must generally be expensed prior to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   which is our fiscal year 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates and the market value of our investments 
financial instruments  other financial instruments sfas no 
 disclosure of fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure about fair value of financial instruments 
financial instruments consist of cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  forward foreign exchange contracts and a line of credit 
the fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount 
foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the euro  british pound  australian dollar and japanese yen 
during  and   and  respectively  of our revenues were generated in locations outside the united states 
the majority of these revenues are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  as are many of the associated expenses 
except for revenue transactions in japan  we enter into transactions directly with substantially all of our foreign customers 
this creates a foreign currency exchange risk for us 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of receivables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we also maintain cash accounts denominated in currencies other that the local currency which expose us to foreign exchange rate movements 
in addition  although our foreign subsidiaries have intercompany accounts that eliminate upon consolidation  such accounts expose us to foreign currency rate movements 
exchange rate fluctuations on short term intercompany accounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations under other income expense  while exchange rate fluctuations on long term intercompany accounts are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets under accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity  as they are considered part of our net investment and hence do not give rise to gains or losses 
we have implemented a risk management program under which we measure foreign currency exchange risk monthly and manage those exposures through the use of various operating strategies as more fully described in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
this process is designed to minimize foreign currency translation exposures that could otherwise affect consolidated results of operations 
the terms of these contracts are for periods generally for one month 
the short term nature of these contracts has resulted in these instruments having insignificant fair values at december  and currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is the british pound  primarily because our european operations have a higher proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december  and  a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows or significantly diminish the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments 
this is primarily due to the short lives of the affected financial instruments that effectively hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
as of december  and we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge approximately million and million  respectively  of receivables  intercompany accounts and cash balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
investments in securities are invested primarily in high quality securities of a short duration and are not materially affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
included within our investment portfolio at december  were million of auction rate securities ars 
these ars are debt instruments issued by various states throughout the united states to finance student loans 
the types of ars that we own are backed by student loans  of which are guaranteed under the federal family education loan program  and all had credit ratings of aaa or equivalent from a recognized rating agency 
the ars are classified as available for sale in our consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report and are recorded at cost 
historically  the carrying value of ars approximated fair market value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates 
the auctions have provided a liquid market for these securities as investors historically could readily sell their investments at auction 
auctions are held every days 
following successful auctions in january  all of our ars have experienced failed auctions in february and march  as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders due to the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets 
the result of a failed auction is that these ars continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms until the next successful auction  however  liquidity will be limited until there is a successful auction or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
as of march   we have liquidated million of the securities  and have classified these securities as current assets in our consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report as of december  as of march   the par value of the ars that we continue to own  which is equal to cost  totals million and are classified as long term investments in the consolidated balance sheet at december   based on the our ability and intent to hold these securities until market conditions improve with successful auctions 
we believe that  based on our unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities balances of million at december   excluding ars of million  the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flow or our ability to fund our operations 
if in the future we determine that any decline in value of the ars is other than temporary  we would be required to recognize the loss in our statement of income  which could have a material impact on our operating results in the period it is recognized 
we have a working capital line of credit which bears interest based upon the prime rate 
at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding under our working capital line of credit
