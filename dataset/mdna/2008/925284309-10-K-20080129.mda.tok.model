background and overview we design  develop  market and support high performance object oriented database management systems and provide related maintenance and professional services 
our products and services address the complex data management needs of enterprises and providers of products requiring data management functions 
our products and services collectively comprise our single operating segment  which we call data management 
our customers typically use our products to manage data for business systems and to enable these systems to access and integrate data necessary for the customers data management applications 
our data management products and services offer customers the ability to manage real time  xml and other types of hierarchical and navigational data 
we believe that by using our data management solutions  customers cut their hardware costs  accelerate and simplify their development efforts  significantly reduce administration costs and deliver products with a significant competitive edge 
our data management business is currently comprised of the following key products versant object database  previously known as vds  a seventh generation object database management system that is used in high performance  large scale  real time applications 
we also offer several optional ancillary products for use with versant object database to provide compatibility and additional protection of stored data 
fastobjects  an object oriented database management system that can be embedded as a high performance component into customers applications and systems 
our versant object database product offerings are used primarily by larger organizations  such as technology providers  telecommunications carriers  government defense agencies and defense contractors  healthcare companies and companies in the financial services and transportation industries  each of which have significant large scale data management requirements 
with the incorporation of poet s fastobjects solution into our product line following our march merger with poet  we expanded the scope of our solutions to also address the data management needs of smaller business systems 
our customers data management needs can involve many business functions  ranging from management of the use and sharing of a company s internal enterprise data to the processing of externally originated information such as customer enrollment  billing and payment transaction data 
our solutions have also been used to solve complex data management issues such as fraud detection  risk analysis and yield management 
in addition to our product offerings  to assist users in developing and deploying applications based on versant object database and fastobjects  we offer a variety of services  including consulting  training and technical support services 
we license our products and sell associated maintenance  training and consulting services to end users through our direct sales force and through value added resellers  systems integrators and distributors 
in addition to these products and services  we resell related software developed by third parties 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from the following data management products and related services sales of licenses for versant object database and fastobjects  maintenance and technical support services for our products  consulting and training services  nonrecurring engineering fees received in connection with providing services associated with versant object database  the resale of licenses  and maintenance  training and consulting services for third party products that complement versant object database  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses  which we incurred and are recorded as revenues in our statement of operations 
financial highlights for fiscal our net revenues in fiscal were million  an increase of million or from net revenues of million in fiscal this increase in revenues was primarily due to the closing in fiscal of several significant transactions with existing customers through both our european and north american operations 
we depend heavily on our installed customer base for future revenues from licenses of additional products or upgrades of existing products and related maintenance renewal fees 
net income for fiscal was million compared to a net income of million in fiscal net income from continuing operations for fiscal was million compared to net income from continuing operations of million in fiscal the increase of million in net income from continuing operations in fiscal was due directly to our increased revenues in fiscal our combined sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  an increase of million or from million reported in fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in our general and administrative and sales and marketing expenses and  to a lesser degree  from an increase in our research and development expenses during fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal was million compared to million of cash provided by operations in fiscal  primarily due to higher net income and  to a lesser extent  a reduction in accounts receivable 
during fiscal  our cash and cash equivalents balance increased by million to million at october  compared to million at october  fiscal and beyond during fiscal  we focused our sales and marketing efforts on our data management products  versant object database and fastobjects  and on related maintenance  consulting and training services 
versant object database was the key focus of our marketing efforts and the major source of our license and service revenues in fiscal we again expect to derive most of our revenues in fiscal from versant object database and fastobjects licenses and related services 
like many other software companies  we do not operate with a significant backlog of orders 
our license revenues  in particular  are difficult to forecast 
for fiscal  we currently estimate total year revenues of approximately million  or an approximate increase from fiscal we also believe that quarterly revenues during fiscal may fluctuate as a result of there being a limited number of revenue transactions in the sales pipeline at any given point in time  and the difficulty in accurately assessing when such transactions may actually close 
we currently estimate net income of approximately million for fiscal  resulting in estimated diluted net income per share of approximately for fiscal  based on our current capitalization 
without limitation  the estimates and forecasts in this paragraph are forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of our assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period covered by our financial statements 
we base these estimates and judgments on information reasonably available to us  such as our historical experience and trends  industry  economic and seasonal fluctuations and on our own internal projections that we derive from that information 
although we believe our estimates to be reasonable under the circumstances  there can be no assurances that such estimates will be accurate given that the application of these accounting policies necessarily involves the exercise of subjective judgment and the making of assumptions regarding many future uncertainties 
we consider critical those accounting policies that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  and income taxes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our revenues consist mainly of revenues earned under software license agreements  maintenance support agreements otherwise known as post contract customer support or pcs  and  to a lesser degree  agreements for consulting and training activities 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date 
if there is an undelivered element under the license arrangement  we defer revenues based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element  as determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements of a transaction  we defer all revenues from that transaction until sufficient evidence exists or until all elements have been delivered 
under the residual method  discounts are allocated only to the delivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  with any undelivered elements being deferred based on the vendor specific objective evidence of the value of such undelivered elements 
we typically do not offer discounts on future undeveloped products 
revenues from software license arrangements  including prepaid license fees  are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
delivery has occurred and there are no future deliverables except pcs 
the fee is fixed and determinable 
if we cannot conclude that a fee is fixed and determinable  then assuming all other criteria have been met  we recognize the revenues as payments become due in accordance with paragraph of sop collection is probable 
probability of collection is assessed using the following information about the customer credit service reports  bank and trade references  public filings  and or current financial statements 
prior payment experience is reviewed on existing customers 
payment terms in excess of our standard payment terms of days net are granted only on an exception basis  typically in situations where customers elect to purchase development and deployment licenses simultaneously for an entire project and are attempting to align their payments with their deployment schedules 
extended payment terms are only granted to customers with a proven ability to pay at the time the order is received  and with prior approval of our senior management 
in accordance with paragraph of sop  we have an established history of collection  without concessions  on longer term receivables 
we typically do not grant extended payment terms beyond days 
if an acceptance period or other contingency exists  revenues are not recognized until customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  or until satisfaction of the contingency  as applicable 
our license fees are non cancelable and non refundable 
also  our customer agreements for prepaid deployment licenses do not make payment of our license fees contingent upon the actual deployment of the software 
therefore  a customer s delay or acceleration in its deployment schedule does not impact our revenue recognition in such cases 
revenues from related pcs for all product lines are usually billed in advance of the service being provided and are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term in which the pcs is to be performed  which is generally twelve months 
in some cases pcs revenues are paid in arrears of the service being provided and are recognized as revenues at the time the customer provides a report to us for deployments made during a given time period 
training and consulting revenues are recognized when a purchase order is received  the services have been performed and collection is deemed probable 
consulting services are billed on an hourly  daily or monthly rate 
training classes are billed based on group or individual attendance 
we categorize our customers into two broad groups  end users and value added resellers vars 
end user customers are companies who use our products internally and do not redistribute our product outside of their corporate organizations 
var customers include traditional value added resellers  systems integrators  original equipment manufacturers oems and other vendors who redistribute our products to their external third party customers  either separately or as part of an integrated product 
we license our data management products through two types of perpetual licenses development licenses and deployment licenses 
development licenses are typically sold on a per seat basis and authorize a customer to develop and test an application program that uses our software product 
prior to an end user customer being able to deploy an application that it has developed under our development license  it must purchase deployment licenses based on the number of computers connected to the server that will run the application using our product 
for certain applications  we offer deployment licenses priced on a per user basis 
pricing of versant object database  and fastobjects licenses varies according to several factors  including the number of computer servers on which the application runs and the number of users that are able to access the server at any one time 
customers may elect to simultaneously purchase development and deployment licenses for an entire project 
these development and deployment licenses may also provide for prepayment to us of a nonrefundable amount for future deployment 
vars and distributors purchase development licenses from us on a per seat basis on terms similar to those of development licenses sold directly to end users 
vars are authorized to sublicense deployment copies of our data management products that are either bundled or embedded in the var s applications and sold directly to end users 
vars are required to report their distribution of our software and are charged a royalty that is either based on the number of copies of our application software that are distributed or computed as a percentage of the selling price charged by the vars to their end user customers 
these royalties from vars may be prepaid in full or paid upon deployment 
provided that all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met  revenues from arrangements with vars are recognized  i as to prepaid license arrangements  when the prepaid licenses are sold to the vars  and ii as to other license arrangements  at the time the var provides a royalty report to us for sales made by the var during a given period 
revenues from our resale of third party products or services are recorded at total contract value with the corresponding cost included in the cost of sales when we act as a principal in these transactions by assuming the risks and rewards of ownership including the risk of loss for collection  delivery or returns 
when we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership  revenues from the resale of third party products or services are recorded at contract value net of the cost of sales 
in instances where  at a customer s request  we perform engineering work to port our products to an unsupported platform or customization of our software for specific functionality  or any other non routine technical assignment  we recognize revenues in accordance with sop accounting research bulletin arb no 
as amended  long term construction type contracts and use either time and material percentage of completion or completed contract methods for recognizing revenues 
we use the percentage of completion method if we can make reasonable and dependable estimates of labor costs and hours required to complete the work in question 
we periodically review these estimates in connection with the work performed and rates actually charged and recognize any losses when identified 
progress to completion is determined using the cost to cost method  whereby cost incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated cost determines the percentage completed and revenue recognized 
when using the percentage of completion method  the following conditions must exist an agreement must include provisions that clearly specify the rights regarding goods or services to be provided and received by both parties  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
the customer is able to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
versant is able to satisfy its obligations under the contract 
the completed contract method is used when reasonable or dependable estimates of labor costs and time to complete the work cannot be made 
as a result  in such situations  we defer all revenues until such time as the work is fully completed 
management makes significant judgments and estimates in connection with the determination of the revenue we recognize in each accounting period 
if we had made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized would have resulted 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets we account for purchases of acquired companies in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations and account for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  we allocate the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired according to their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs  or ipr d  if any  are charged to operations expenditures at the time of acquisition 
we test for any goodwill impairment within our single data management operating segment 
all our goodwill has been aggregated from  and acquired in connection with  the following acquisitions versant europe  acquired in  poet holdings  inc  acquired in march  technology of jdo genie pty ltd  acquired in june  and fastobjects  inc  acquired in july we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as provided in sfas we use the market approach to assess the fair value of our assets and this value is compared with the carrying value of those assets to test for impairment 
the total fair value of our assets is estimated by summing the fair value of our equity as indicated by versant publicly traded share price and shares outstanding plus a control premium less our liabilities 
under this approach  if the estimated fair value of our assets is greater than their carrying value  then there is no goodwill impairment 
if the estimated fair value of our assets is less than their carrying value  then we allocate the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities as though the reporting unit had just been acquired in a business combination 
the impairment loss is the amount  if any  by which the implied fair value of goodwill allocable to the reporting unit is less than that reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount and would be recorded in operating results during the period of such impairment 
as required by sfas  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective november  prior to november   we amortized goodwill over five years using the straight line method 
identifiable intangibles are currently amortized over five years in relation to the jdo genie pty ltd acquisition  six years in relation to the fastobjects  inc acquisition  and seven years in relation to our acquisition of poet  using the straight line method in each of these cases 
we performed tests and valuations on our goodwill and intangible assets on july  based on the provisions of sfas and sfas as a result  in fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the write down of goodwill and a charge of million related to the write down of intangible assets  of which million was recorded as impairment of poet intangible assets and  was recorded as impairment of fastobjects  inc intangible assets 
we performed our annual valuation and analysis of goodwill based on the requirements of sfas in october and october we did not perform impairment tests related to our intangible assets during fiscal and fiscal based on the requirements of sfas  as there were no triggering events which might indicate impairment 
as a result  we determined that the value of our goodwill and intangible assets had been fairly recorded in our financial statements  and therefore  no impairment charges against our goodwill and intangible assets related to our poet  jdo genie pty and fastobjects acquisitions were recorded in fiscal and fiscal income taxes we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes payable as part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and amortization  for financial and tax reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent deemed realizable 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and the extent we believe that recovery is not likely 
we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets to the extent such assets are not deemed to be realizable 
if we establish a valuation allowance or increase it in a given period  then we must increase the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we have established full valuation allowances at october  and october  for our deferred tax assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth the historical results of operations for versant for our three fiscal years ended october   and  expressed as a percentage of total revenues

fluctuations in our total revenues can be attributed to changes in product and customer mix  general trends in information technology spending  changes in geographic mix  and the corresponding impact of changes in foreign exchange rates 
further  product life cycles impact revenues periodically as old contracts expire and new products are released 
our revenues as shown in the above table and in the accompanying statements of operations included in this report do not include revenues from our disposed websphere consulting practice 
instead  as required by generally accepted accounting principles  our financial statements report former websphere activities as net income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information regarding this transaction 
our total revenues increased by million or in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from a increase in license revenues and a increase in maintenance revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  included favorable foreign currency fluctuations of million and was partly offset by a decrease in professional services revenues 
we believe that license revenues increased in fiscal over fiscal due to various factors  including increased maturity  stability and focus of our sales organization  the increased acceptance and success of our var customers applications with end users  the overall reputation and acceptance of our products in the vertical markets including telecommunications  technology and defense that we serve  the relative strength of the worldwide economy in fiscal  and the strong euro as compared to the united states dollar in fiscal  resulting in higher consolidated revenues 
maintenance revenues increased in fiscal over fiscal primarily as a result of the increased license revenues in the same period 
our total revenues increased by  or in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted primarily from a increase in professional services revenues and a increase in maintenance revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  and included favorable foreign currency fluctuations of  and was partly offset by a decrease in license revenues 
one customer accounted for of our total revenues for the quarter ended october   and one customer accounted for of our total revenues for fiscal one customer accounted for of our total revenues for the quarter ended october   and no one customer accounted for or more of our total revenues for fiscal the inherently unpredictable business cycle of an enterprise software company makes discernment of continued and meaningful business trends difficult 
in terms of license revenues  we are still experiencing lengthy sales cycles and customers preference for licensing our software on an as needed basis  versus the historical practice of prepaying license fees in advance of usage  a factor which can adversely affect the amount of our license revenues 
license revenues also are a factor in driving the amount of our services revenues  as new license customers typically enter into support and maintenance agreements with us 
we are currently forecasting total revenues for fiscal to increase approximately compared to total revenues for fiscal  and we intend to increase our sales personnel headcounts during fiscal revenues by category the following table summarizes our revenues by category in thousands  except percentages in fiscal  and fiscal year ended october  fiscal vs increase decrease fiscal vs increase decrease in dollars percentage in dollars percentage total revenues by category license revenues     maintenance revenues     professional services revenues   total     percentage of revenues by category license revenues maintenance revenues professional services revenues total fiscal compared to fiscal license revenues license revenues represent perpetual license fees received and recognized from our end users and value added resellers 
license revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal  an increase of million or from license revenues of million or of total revenues reported in fiscal the higher license revenues for fiscal were due in part to two significant license agreements with two us customers for approximately  and  and one significant license transaction with a us customer for approximately million sourced through our european operations  as well as three additional license agreements with three european customers for approximately million   and  the majority of the growth in our license revenues in fiscal over fiscal was driven primarily by license transactions with existing var customers in the telecommunications industry  which was our largest vertical market in fiscal maintenance revenues maintenance and technical support revenues include revenues derived from maintenance agreements  under which we provide customers with internet and telephone access to support personnel and software upgrades  dedicated technical assistance and emergency response support options 
maintenance revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal  representing an increase of million or from maintenance revenues of million or of total revenues reported in fiscal the increased maintenance revenues for fiscal are due primarily to incremental revenues of million recognized during fiscal from new maintenance agreements attributable to the license revenue growth from both us and european based customers and  to a lesser extent  maintenance revenues of  related to the sale of premium support and maintenance agreements for software applications using older versions of our software 
professional services revenues professional services revenues consist of revenues from consulting  training and technical support as well as billable travel expenses incurred by our professional services organization 
professional services revenues were  or of total revenues in fiscal  a decline of million or from million or of total revenues reported in fiscal this decline in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to the fact that in fiscal  we recognized million in revenues from two significant percentage of completion consulting projects with two european customers but had no such corresponding professional services revenue transactions of this magnitude in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal license revenues license revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal  a decline of  or from million or of total revenues reported in fiscal in the european region  there was a  decrease in license revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to a significant follow on order from a european telecommunications company during the three months ended january  for which there was no comparable license transaction in fiscal this decline was partially offset by a  increase in license revenues from our north american region  largely as a result of a significant license transaction closed in the fourth quarter of fiscal maintenance revenues maintenance revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal  an increase of  or from million or of total revenues reported in fiscal european maintenance revenues increased  in fiscal  primarily as a result of three larger maintenance contracts  an increase in extended support agreements ie  for customers using older versant software not supported through standard support agreements that have a higher selling price  and to a lesser extent  back maintenance revenues 
additionally  in fiscal there was an increase of  in maintenance revenues from our north american operations  primarily as a result of an increase in extended support agreements 
professional services revenues professional services revenues were million or of total revenues in fiscal  an increase of  or from  or of total revenues reported in fiscal this increase was mainly due to two significant percentage of completion consulting arrangements with two european customers during fiscal international revenues the following table summarizes our total revenues by geographic area in thousands  except percentages in fiscal  and fiscal year ended october  fiscal vs increase decrease fiscal vs increase decrease in dollars percentage in dollars percentage total revenues by geographic area north america     europe    asia total     percentage of revenues by geographic area north america europe asia total fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues increased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues was due primarily to a revenue increase of million in our north american operations as a result of closing several significant transactions with us customers during fiscal additionally  there was a revenue increase of  from our european and asian regions 
international non north american revenues represented approximately and of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
revenues from north america the million or revenue increase from north america in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly due to two significant transactions with two north american customers totaling approximately million  as well as the closing of one significant license and maintenance transaction with a us customer for approximately million in revenues sourced through our european operations 
revenues from europe the  or revenue increase from europe in fiscal compared to fiscal was due mainly to the closing of three license agreements with three european customers for approximately million during fiscal  offset by a decrease of million in professional services revenues in fiscal versus fiscal due to the fact that two significant percentage of completion consulting projects in fiscal were not replaced with comparable projects in fiscal revenues from asia we also experienced an increase of  or in revenues from our asia pacific region during fiscal  primarily due to royalties of  from an existing asian customer 
since the company s acquisition of poet holdings  inc in early  we have generally derived a higher percentage of international revenues due to stronger demand for our products in europe 
however  the closing of a significant license and maintenance transaction with a us customer for approximately million in revenues sourced through our european operations during fiscal has been included as north american revenues 
this one transaction accounted for of the overall north american revenue increase for fiscal compared to fiscal and accounted for much of the increase in the percentage of our revenues sourced from north america in fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect in the future to experience a somewhat stronger demand for our products in europe as compared to our other geographic markets  including north america 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues increased  or in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in revenues was due primarily to a revenue increase of  in north america as a result of closing a significant license transaction during the fourth quarter of fiscal in the us additionally  there was an increase of  in revenues from our european and asian regions in fiscal as compared to fiscal international revenues represented approximately and of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the high percentage of international revenues for both fiscal and fiscal is mainly due to the following stronger demand for our products in europe 
change of management and reduction in sales personnel in our us operations 
discontinuation of us websphere consulting practice 
integration of the poet products in europe as a result of our merger with poet

the  decline in absolute dollars was due mainly to a headcount reduction of one employee resulting in a reduction in salary and related expenses of  in our us operations as a result of fiscal restructuring activities  and was offset by an increase of approximately  in travel and related expenses in our european operations as a result of increased maintenance revenues in that region

prior to our merger with poet in march  poet holdings  inc provided for a reserve for such warranties that could be in excess of its regular maintenance programs 
as of october   we continued to maintain a warranty reserve of approximately  related to the fastobjects products in europe 
pursuant to our consulting percentage of completion engagements with certain european customers  we recorded additional warranty reserves of  for fiscal these reserves were subsequently reversed during the fourth quarter of fiscal upon expiration of the one year warranty period

fiscal compared to fiscal cost of professional services revenues was million or of professional services revenues in fiscal  and increased  or from the cost of professional services revenues of  or of professional services revenues in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increases in salary and consultant compensation as a result of transferring personnel resources from engineering to professional services 
the professional services margin percentage improved by points in fiscal compared to fiscal due to better utilization of our professional personnel 
the negative margin in professional services for fiscal was due to under utilization of one full time employee dedicated to professional services as a result of delays related to a major consulting project during fiscal amortization of intangible assets the amortization of intangible assets in fiscal consists of the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of poet holdings  inc  fastobjects  inc

this increase also included an unfavorable foreign currency exchange fluctuation of  however total operating expenses in fiscal represented a lower percentage of total revenues than did total operating expenses in fiscal in june we relocated our us corporate headquarters from fremont  california to redwood city  california 
as a result of this relocation  we anticipate a reduction in our quarterly operating expenses for financial reporting purposes of approximately  in building lease and related facility expenses through the end of the current lease term now scheduled for may  primarily due to the fact that we occupy less square footage in our new redwood city facility than in our former fremont offices

sales and marketing expenses were million or of total revenues in fiscal  an increase of  or  compared to million or of total revenues in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars for sales and marketing expense for fiscal was partly due to an approximate  increase in sales commissions and bonuses payable as a result of higher revenues for the company in fiscal than in fiscal in both our european and us operations  and an approximate  increase in marketing expenses related to advertising campaigns and trade shows in our european operations 
the increase was partially offset by one headcount reduction in our us operations resulting in a reduction of salary  severance and other payroll related expenses totaling  together with an approximate  decrease in marketing programs in our us operations

general and administrative expenses were million or of total revenues in fiscal  an increase of  or  compared to million or of total revenues in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars for fiscal was primarily due to an approximate  increase in legal fees and costs associated with a pending litigation  an approximate  increase in bonuses as a result of improved financial results in fiscal as compared to fiscal  an approximate  increase in stock based compensation expense due to stock option grants and increased participation in our employee stock purchase plan  and an approximate  net increase in facility expenses as a result of costs related to the relocation of our us corporate headquarters from fremont  california to redwood city  california 
these increases were offset by one headcount reduction in our us operations resulting in a reduction of salary  severance and other payroll related expenses totaling  and an approximate  decrease in accounting and auditing fees in our us operations 
we expect our general and administrative expenses in fiscal to be comparable to those in fiscal we expect increased costs associated with the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley of to be offset by decreases in other general and administrative expenses including facility costs in fiscal loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary reflects the realization of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to our former uk subsidiary  versant ltd  upon completion of its liquidation in fiscal the loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary was  or of total revenues in fiscal with no comparable amount in fiscal we elected to liquidate versant ltd  our subsidiary in the united kingdom  to reduce costs and centralize our european operations

net product to vanatec  and we committed to a capital contribution to vanatec of an additional  euros or  which we contributed in full on november  we determined that equity at risk in vanatec was not sufficient to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  therefore  we considered vanatec a variable interest entity in accordance with fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities as amended 
vanatec s results of operations were included in our consolidated financial statements for the three month periods ended july   october  and january  and through march  during the three months ended january   we absorbed our share of vanatec s losses up to the point that it exceeded variable interest liability  and subsequent to that we absorbed of the losses that vanatec had incurred for an additional amount of  for the three months ended january  in addition  we continued to absorb of vanatec s losses for an additional amount of  for the period between february  and march   until we determined that we were no longer required to consolidate vanatec s operating results  as described below 
on march   we sold our interest in vanatec to a third party investor for  euros and entered into a joint ownership agreement with vanatec with respect to certain technology we had previously licensed to vanatec 
according to this agreement  vanatec is obligated to pay versant a running royalty at a rate of six percent of its net proceeds  but no less than euros per copy  from licenses it grants of the co owned technology for a period of five years following the effective date of this agreement 
further  at any time during the royalty period  vanatec has the right to exercise a buyout for its royalty obligations by making a one time payment to versant of  euros 
as a result of versant s sale of its interest in vanatec and this agreement  versant determined that it was no longer the primary beneficiary of vanatec as defined by fin r  and thus  was no longer required to consolidate vanatec s operating results after march  interest and other income  net interest and other income  net consists of interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents net of interest expense due to our financing activities  miscellaneous refunds and foreign exchange rate gains and losses as a result of settling transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currency

gain on disposal of vie as discussed above  we are no longer required to consolidate the operating results of vanatec as of march   therefore  we recorded a gain of  related to the deconsolidation of vanatec in our consolidated statement of operations during the three months ended april  this amount is comprised of the reversal of the excess losses that we had absorbed previously for  the consideration that we received from a third party investor in lieu of our interest at vanatec of  the transfer of property and equipment for  other comprehensive income for  and offset by foreign currency losses of  consequently  the results of vanatec are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended october  provision for income taxes provision for income taxes primarily consists of corporate income taxes for our subsidiaries in germany and india and  to a lesser extent  foreign withholding taxes and state income and franchise taxes in the us the following table summarizes our provision for income taxes in thousands  except percentages in fiscal  and fiscal year ended october  fiscal vs increase decrease fiscal vs increase decrease in dollars percentage in dollars percentage provision for income taxes foreign withholding taxes provision for income taxes europe provision for income taxes india federal  state and franchise taxes total although we have not exhausted our net operating tax loss carry forwards in germany  the german tax code provides for certain annual statutory limitations related to the use of tax loss carry forward amounts 
the provision for income taxes in germany of approximately  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  were attributable to taxable income related to our german operations that were in excess of the allowable utilization of the tax loss carry forwards  and therefore  subject to corporate taxes 
we incurred foreign withholding taxes and state income and franchise taxes of approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  which we have included in our income tax provision 
at october   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and federal and state tax credit carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal tax credit carry forwards expire on various dates through  if not utilized 
the state tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
additionally  at october   we had german net operating tax loss carry forwards of approximately million 
the german net operating tax loss carry forwards can be carried forward indefinitely 
due to our history of operating losses  we believe that there is sufficient uncertainty regarding the realizability of these carry forwards and  therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million has been recorded against our net deferred tax assets as of october  we will continue to assess the realizability of the tax benefit available based on actual and forecasted operating results 
due to change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  the availability of net operating loss and tax carry forwards to offset federal taxable income in future periods is subject to an annual limitation 
a portion of deferred tax assets relating to net operating losses pertains to net operating loss carry forwards resulting from tax deductions upon the exercise of employee stock options of approximately million

income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes in february  we sold our websphere consulting business in exchange for a one time cash payment plus certain contingent payments during a month period following the close of the transaction 
as a result  we have reflected the results of operations of the websphere consulting practice for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal as income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes

we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge these operating expenses 
we intend to assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis during fiscal our exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the magnitude of foreign net profits and losses denominated in euros and pound sterling  as well as our net position of monetary assets and monetary liabilities in those foreign currencies 
these exposures have the potential to produce either gains or losses within our consolidated results 
however  in some instances our european operations act as a natural hedge since both operating expenses as well as revenues are denominated in local currencies 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of euros or pounds sterling against the us dollar will result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  the operating expenditures will be lower as well 
additionally  we have maintained approximately of our total cash balance in the form of us dollars to assist in neutralizing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
in relation to our cash balances held overseas  there were no european union foreign exchange restrictions on repatriating our overseas held cash to the united states 
however  we may be subject to income tax withholding in the source countries and to us federal and state income taxes if the cash payment or transfer from our subsidiaries to the us parent were to be classified as a dividend 
other payments made by our european overseas subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business eg payment of royalties or interest from the subsidiaries to the us parent were generally not subject to income tax withholding due to tax treaties 
our cash equivalents primarily consist of money market accounts  accordingly  our interest rate risk is not considered significant 
we believe that with our current cost structure and based on our current estimates of revenues and collections in fiscal  we can reasonably expect to operate at a positive cash flow level in fiscal cash flow provided by operating activities this table aggregates certain line items from our cash flow statements for the following fiscal years to present the key items affecting our operating activities in thousands fiscal year ended october  net cash provided by operating activities net income loss    gain from the disposal of assets loss on the liquidation of a foreign subsidiary net income from discontinued operations non cash adjustments   accounts receivable  other assets accounts payable  accrued liabilities and other liabilities deferred revenues deferred rents total   the main source of our operating cash flows is cash collections from customers who have purchased our products and services 
our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for personnel related expenditures and facilities costs 
fiscal we generated million of cash flows from operations in fiscal this was primarily derived from million in net income and a  reduction in accounts receivables and other assets  non cash adjustments were million  as reflected in our cash flow statement in fiscal  which were primarily depreciation and amortization expense of  and stock based compensation expense of  non cash adjustments may increase or decrease in the future and  as a result  this might positively or negatively impact our future operating results  but they will not have a direct impact on our cash flows 
the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable and collections from our customers for accounts receivable will impact our cash flows from operating activities 
we typically pay our vendors and service providers in accordance with their invoice terms and conditions 
our standard payment terms for our invoices are usually between and days net 
we measure the effectiveness of our collection efforts by an analysis of our accounts receivable and our days sales outstanding dso 
we calculate dso by taking the ending accounts receivable balances net of bad debt allowance divided by the average daily sales amount 
average daily sales amount is calculated by dividing the total quarterly revenue recognized net of changes in deferred revenues by days 
collection of accounts receivable and related dso could fluctuate in the future periods  due to timing and amount of our revenues and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our dsos were days  days and days for the three months ended october   october  and october   respectively 
our working capital was million as of october  compared to million as of october  we relocated our us corporate headquarters from fremont  california to redwood city  california in june as a result of this relocation  we anticipate a reduction in our quarterly cash outflows of approximately  related to reduced building lease and related facility expenses through the end of the current lease term now scheduled for may  primarily due to the fact that we occupy less square footage in our new redwood city facility than we did in our former fremont offices 
the difference in the estimated increased quarterly cash outflow savings of  as compared to the estimated reduction in our quarterly operating expenses for financial reporting purposes of  is primarily the result of restructuring charges recorded in our financial statements for prior periods 
fiscal we generated million of cash flows from operations in fiscal this was primarily derived from million in net income and was partially offset by  cash used  as a result of reduction in accounts payables  accrued liabilities and other liabilities 
non cash adjustments were  as reflected in our cash flow statement in fiscal  which were primarily depreciation and amortization expense of  and stock based compensation expense of  our working capital was million as of october  compared to  as of october  fiscal we generated  of cash flows from operations in fiscal this was primarily due to a million reduction in accounts receivables as a result of improved collections procedures and improved days sales outstanding  or dso  and was partially offset by million cash used  as a result of reduction in accounts payables  accrued liabilities and other liabilities

cash flow provided by financing activities our main source of cash from financing activities was proceeds from sale of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans and  in the periods that we had a receivable line of credit in place  periodic draw downs on the credit line that were typically repaid within a month 
fiscal in fiscal   of cash was provided by financing activities comprised of the following cash inflows of  due to proceeds from the sale of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  and principal payments of  under capital lease obligations 
our future liquidity and capital resources could be impacted by the exercise of outstanding common stock options and the cash proceeds we receive upon exercise of these securities 
further  as of october  we had approximately  shares available to issue under our current equity incentive and director plans 
the timing of the issuance  the duration of their vesting provision and the grant price will all impact the timing of any proceeds 
accordingly  we cannot estimate the amount of such proceeds at this time 
our million credit facility with a financial institution expired by its terms in june  and we currently do not anticipate establishing another credit or loan facility in fiscal fiscal in fiscal   cash was provided by financing activities comprised of the following cash inflows of  due to proceeds from the sale of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  cash payments of  for the repayment of the borrowing under our line of credit  and principal payments of  under capital lease obligations

on march   we entered into an office building lease with ca shorebreeze limited partnership pursuant to which we are leasing approximately  square feet in an office facility located in redwood city  california 
the lease has a term of thirty six months  which commenced in june the redwood city  california office under the lease serves as our new us headquarters  replacing our former facility in fremont  california  whose lease expired on june  monthly rent under the lease for our redwood city office will initially be approximately  and is subject to annual increases thereafter 
the total rent payable over the full thirty six month lease term net of two months rent abatement will be approximately  we have an option to extend the term of the lease for one additional one year period at a rent equal to the then fair market lease rate 
pursuant to the lease  the landlord has agreed to provide a tenant improvement allowance of approximately  any tenant improvement costs exceeding this allowance are borne by us 
rental expense under this agreement  including contractual rent increases  is recognized on a straight line basis 
we also lease field office space in europe and india  generally under multi year operating lease agreements 
consolidated rent expense in fiscal years ended october   october  and october   was approximately   and million  respectively 
our annual minimum commitments as of october  under non cancelable operating leases are listed as follows in thousands rental lease equipment leases total fiscal year ending october  thereafter total   we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash to be generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations during the next twelve months 
however  if we fail to generate adequate cash flows from operations in the future  due to an unexpected decline in our revenues  or due to a sustained increase in cash expenditures in excess of the revenues generated  then our cash balances may not be sufficient to fund our continuing operations without obtaining additional debt or equity financing 
additional cash may also be needed to acquire or invest in complementary businesses products or to purchase or license technologies  and we expect that  in the event of such an acquisition or investment that is significant and requires that we pay cash consideration  it will be necessary for us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
our million credit facility with a financial institution expired by its terms in june  and we currently do not anticipate establishing another credit or loan facility in fiscal if we are required to obtain additional financing for our working capital  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on reasonable financial or other terms  or at all 
the prices at which new investors might be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the market value or the trading price of our common stock 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could also result in dilution to our shareholders  which could be substantial and may involve the issuance of preferred securities that would have liquidation preferences that entitle holders of the preferred securities to receive certain amounts before holders of our common stock in connection with an acquisition or business combination involving versant or a liquidation of versant 
new investors may also seek agreements giving them additional voting control or seats on our board of directors 
even if we were able to obtain additional debt or equity financing  the terms of any such financing might significantly restrict our business activities and in some circumstances  might require us to obtain the approval of our shareholders  which could delay or prevent consummation of the financing transaction 
our software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe upon a third party s intellectual property rights 
to date  we have not incurred any material costs as a result of any indemnification 
however  as a result of current litigation in which rockwell automation  one of our customers  is seeking indemnification from us for alleged infringement of intellectual property rights asserted against it by systems america  inc  we have recorded an immaterial loss contingency reserve as of january  in accordance with fasb statement no 
to date  we have incurred significant legal costs as a result of this litigation 
we are continuing to contest the allegations of infringement of intellectual property rights asserted in this litigation
