item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s financial statements and notes  included elsewhere in this report  and the information contained in selected financial and operating data 
overview principal factors affecting stillwater mining company stillwater mining company mines  processes  refines and markets palladium  platinum and minor amounts of other metals from two mines situated within the j m reef  an extensive trend of pgm mineralization located in stillwater and sweet grass counties in south central montana 
pgm ore grades in the j m reef are some of the best in the world  but because of the uplifted configuration of the reef  they also are costly and complex to mine 
the mines compete primarily with pgm ore reserves in the republic of south africa  which generally are much higher in platinum content and less steeply dipping  and with nickel mines in the russian federation which produce pgms as a major by product and so at a very low marginal cost 
consequently  in periods of low pgm prices  stillwater mining company s cost structure may put it at a disadvantage to these competitors 
see business and properties risk factors the company is a relatively high cost primary producer for further discussion of this issue 
the company s mining output is highly dependent on the availability of skilled underground miners 
with the general strengthening of mineral prices over the past several years  the demand for experienced miners has grown significantly 
there is now a shortage of skilled miners within the united states and canada  and as new operations are developed  the shortage has grown 
coming off the past decade or so of depressed commodity prices  very few new miners and mining engineers were being trained  so the industry is now faced with a fixed or declining pool of skilled workers in an expanding market 
the company s operations are relatively manpower intensive  so a shortage of skilled labor could restrict the company s ability to maintain or expand production levels 
this is a critical issue and the company has sought to address it through an aggressive miner training program intended to bolster the workforce and provide replacements when existing miners retire or otherwise choose to leave 
the combined effects of workforce attrition and less experienced miners in reduced overall productivity and impeded the company s ability to meet its production targets 
in a very competitive market for mining skills  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to retain a workforce adequate to maintain and expand current production rates 
despite these concerns  the company is very pleased with the success of its training programs  more than of the company s mining employees now are graduates of this program 
this topic is discussed in more detail in business and properties risk factors limited availability of additional mining personnel and uncertainty of labor relations may affect the company s ability to achieve its production targets and in performance below 
the company s hourly workforce is represented by the united steelworkers of america under two separate labor agreements 
the labor agreement covering the hourly workforce at the east boulder mine is set to expire on july  the company cannot assure that it will be able to renew that contract in a timely or satisfactory manner and not experience labor interruptions or other disputes with labor unions or employees in the future 
negotiations for renewal of the east boulder agreement are scheduled to begin during the first quarter of a separate agreement covering the workers at the stillwater mine and at the company s processing facilities in columbus  montana was renegotiated during and will expire on july  substantially all of the palladium and platinum produced from mining is sold under contracts with two major automotive manufacturers  ford motor company and general motors corporation  for use in automotive catalytic converters 
these automotive contracts include floor and  in some cases  ceiling prices on palladium and platinum 
the larger of these contracts expires at the end of  and the other  which was amended and extended on terms favorable to the company during  will expire at the end of under its automotive sales agreements  the company now has committed of its mined palladium production and of its mined platinum production through  and at least of its palladium production in and unless these contracts are renewed under similarly favorable terms  once these contracts expire the company will be fully exposed to the volatility of pgm prices 
while recent pgm prices have exceeded the contractual floor prices  in the past the floor prices on palladium proved to be critically important to the company s financial performance when palladium prices declined sharply 

table of contents beginning in  the major us bond rating agencies have successively downgraded the corporate ratings of ford and general motors  the company s two largest customers 
under applicable law  in the event one or both of these companies should become insolvent or file for protection under the bankruptcy statutes  their respective obligations under the pgm supply agreements could be voided 
in addition  under the terms of the company s credit facility  a default by ford or general motors or the early termination of these contracts could prohibit additional loans and trigger a requirement for the immediate repayment of the company s outstanding loans 
the deterioration of the credit of these two customers places additional emphasis on the company s need to reduce its mining costs  so as to reduce its dependency on the above market pricing in the automotive contracts 
the company also recycles spent catalyst materials through its processing facilities in columbus  montana  recovering palladium  platinum and rhodium from these materials 
the recycling business has proven to be a very attractive and profitable ancillary business that utilizes surplus capacity in the company s smelting and refining facilities 
it has grown rapidly during the past two or three years  but with the increases in pgm prices over the same period  it also has become much more competitive 
the recycling business requires stillwater mining company to advance against third party inventory purchases and to carry large working inventories for extended periods until processing is completed and the final metals are released 
as such  it creates collection exposures and requires significant investments in working capital that draw against the company s liquidity balances 
in acquiring recycled automotive catalysts  the company regularly advances funds to its suppliers in order to facilitate its procurement efforts 
at this time the company s recycling business is substantially dependent upon one such supplier who supplies pgms to the company on an exclusive basis 
the company works closely with its suppliers to monitor this business and the related advances 
a portion of these advances is secured by material in supplier inventory  but a substantial portion is not secured and remains at risk 
while the company believes these advances are fully collectible  there is no assurance that the suppliers will be able to repay them in full 
nonpayment would likely result in a write off which could be material 
as the company s recycling business has grown  these risk exposures generally have increased in importance 
see business and properties risk factors reliance on third parties for sourcing of recycled materials for additional detail 
the company is endeavoring to achieve consistent long term profitability with respect to its mining operations 
to date  management does not believe that this objective has been achieved 
profitability depends on the market price for metals and a number of factors outside the control of management 
historically  pgm prices have been very sensitive to fluctuations in supply and demand  and these markets can be very volatile 
recognizing the company s exposure to this volatility and the historical dependence on the performance of the mines  management is pursuing three broad strategic areas of focus  each discussed in more detail below  intended to strengthen profitability and stabilize performance transformation of the mining methods employed in the stillwater and east boulder mines  development of new markets for palladium  and growth and diversification of the company s business to the extent that an opportunity is presented which the board of directors believes is complementary to the company s business and furthers the best interests of shareholders 
performance the company reported a net loss of million in  compared to a net income of million in a detailed comparison of these outcomes is presented below in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  during  the company s mining operations produced a total of  ounces of palladium and platinum  including  ounces of palladium and  ounces of platinum  falling short of its most recent mine production guidance for of approximately  ounces of pgms 
the lower production resulted from mining productivity issues following higher attrition in the ranks of skilled miners as well as among maintenance groups that reduced equipment availability at stillwater mine and the implementation of new mining methods at east boulder mine 
the attrition at stillwater mine was precipitated by a change in work schedule early in the year and from labor issues and a brief strike associated with contract negotiations at midyear 
the prior seven day on  seven day off work schedule at stillwater mine  which had been used to attract experienced miners from outside the region  became less effective beginning in as metal prices started to rise and industry demand for skilled underground miners increased 
in response  in the company reduced its minimum hiring age and implemented a six month training program to develop a more locally based workforce 
the effect of the schedule change at the stillwater mine was to increase the average work week from hours to hours  allowing the company to reduce its reliance on contract miners used to supplement the workforce 
following a rise in attrition rates during the summer of 
table of contents  rates declined to more normal levels by year end however  the remaining workforce  having less total mining experience  will take time to regain the previous level of productivity 
the east boulder mine has been moving away from its earlier complete reliance on sublevel extraction  a highly mechanized method of mining  and is implementing mechanical ramp and fill and captive cut and fill stoping  more selective mining methods that require some retraining of the workforce 
market prices for platinum group metals on average were higher during than in the year before 
however  the company s sales realizations to a large extent in did not fully benefit from the increased market prices 
in the case of palladium  favorable minimum selling prices in the automotive contracts tended to provide the company with average revenues in excess of market 
on the other hand  platinum revenues were heavily constrained by ceiling prices on a portion of the mine production sold under contracts with two major automotive manufacturers and by financially settled forward contracts entered into in the past at notional prices well below today s market 
when put in place beginning in  these derivative transactions were intended to reduce the company s financial exposure in the event that prices for platinum were to weaken  particularly in view of the substantial capital program then facing the company to improve the developed state of the mines 
during  and  with platinum prices continuing to rise  the company reported a charge against income  representing the difference between financially settled forward prices and actual market prices at the date of settlement all related to mine production of million  million and million  respectively 
the volume of the company s annual platinum sales covered by these financially settled forwards will drop to  ounces in all maturing by the end of june from  ounces in  enabling average platinum realizations in to more closely track the market price 
see note to the company s audited financial statements for further detail regarding derivative transactions 
capital spending declined somewhat in  although the company continues its program to extend the developed state of both mines 
this effort includes increasing proven ore reserves and expanding infrastructure to facilitate a move toward more efficient production in the future 
actual capital expenditures of million were about million below the company s guidance for the year of million 
the decrease in spending was mostly attributable to delaying the start of construction on a second smelter furnace in columbus until the company is targeting total mine pgm production for of between  and  ounces  which assumes some growth in the mining workforce and gradually increasing mining productivity as the existing workforce gains experience 
clearly  the company s ability to meet these targets is subject to uncertainties  including anticipated improvement in mining productivity  reasonable attrition rates and a successful conclusion to labor negotiations at the east boulder mine during capital expenditures in are expected to be about million  and include about million of investment in the second furnace at the company s smelter in columbus  montana 
see business and properties risk factors achievement of the company s production goals is subject to uncertainties above 
during  the company processed approximately  ounces of recycled pgms in its smelting and refining facilities  a increase over total ounces recycled in the processing of recycled materials benefits from the nickel and copper sulfides in mine concentrates  which act as collecting agents 
in the company entered into an agreement with a major us collector of catalytic converters to purchase substantial volumes for processing 
this agreement has since been modified and extended to facilitate expansion of these activities 
either party is able to terminate the relationship at its discretion upon providing ninety days notice 
on april   the company entered into a second supply agreement with another supplier  although the volumes committed under the second agreement are significantly less than the first 
the specific commercial terms of these agreements are confidential 
the recycling business has grown rapidly and is an important contributor of earnings and cash flow to the company 
however  under these recycling agreements the company advances significant sums of cash for purchase and collection of these spent catalyst materials prior to physical receipt  and commits additional amounts as working capital in inventory 
a substantial portion of the cash advanced is unsecured and so carries recovery risk 
also  a large share of the company s total recycling volume is supplied by a single collector  so the company s recycling performance is highly dependent on the performance of that supplier 
the company has various spot purchase and tolling arrangements with other suppliers of spent catalytic materials  but the volumes from them are less significant 
recent developments the republic of south africa was the largest supplier in of platinum of world supply  according to johnson matthey and rhodium and the second largest supplier of mined palladium into the world market 
as such  south african production plays a key role in pgm markets 
efforts to improve mine safety in south african mines resulted in several brief mine closures late in that modestly reduced pgm output for the year 
in late january of  following a period of heavy rains  the south african state utility was unable to supply adequate 
table of contents power to meet demand  and power deliveries to the mines were initially curtailed and then restricted to of normal levels 
the anticipated shortfalls in production that have resulted from these cutbacks have driven up the price of platinum to record levels in early to a limited extent  palladium and rhodium also have experienced higher market prices 
in the palladium markets  johnson matthey estimates that the russian federation supplied about of world requirements in  including about million ounces supplied in late out of government inventories 
the market closely tracks these russian inventory sales because they largely represent oversupply into the market that tends to be absorbed into metal inventories in switzerland 
swiss inventory reports issued in january for the month of december suggest that russian inventory exports were down sharply during representing only about million ounces 
it is not yet clear if this reduction in russian exports will continue  or if it will be made up in future months 
however  this uncertainty has also contributed to added volatility in the palladium price 
the long term effect of these price increases will depend on whether the higher pgm prices persist 
the factors affecting supply and price thus far in could also adversely affect demand for pgms  particularly in discretionary areas like jewelry purchases 
with the completion of the company s platinum hedging program during the first half of  the company is well positioned to benefit from higher platinum and palladium prices 
any significant decline in palladium prices would be partially mitigated by the pricing floors in the automotive contracts  while any decline in platinum prices would affect net mining revenues except for the of mine production currently capped by an per ounce ceiling price essentially dollar for dollar 
following at least in part on problems that developed in worldwide credit markets beginning in the summer of  it appears that the us economy could experience an economic recession during the potential effects of such a recession on the company s financial performance are difficult to gauge 
in late and early  the demand for new automobiles appeared to be weakening in the us and european markets  which could in turn reduce demand for pgms in catalytic converters and so put downward pressure on pgm prices 
on the other hand  a recession could also cool worldwide demand for other commodities and services  which might reduce cost pressures on fuel  steel and explosives that the company has endured in recent years 
strategic initiatives the company s management is continuing to address several long term structural challenges that bear on its future performance 
these challenges include first  despite above market average floor prices on palladium in the company s contracts with the auto companies  strong commodity prices and the relatively high pgm grade of the company s reserves  the company s financial results continue to be hampered by rising costs per ounce of pgm production  by the high percentage of less experienced miners in the company s workforce  and by transitional issues that stem from changing the company s mix of core mining methods 
the company believes that these issues can all be resolved over the next two or three years through improving productivity as the company s workforce gains additional experience 
underlying all this  though  and to some degree masked by the current strength in metal prices  is a fundamental competitiveness issue 
the company s ore reserves  although high grade  are palladium rich  with an average ratio of approximately ounces of palladium recovered for each ounce of platinum  by comparison  south african ores have a significant cost advantage in that they generally are much richer in platinum  and russian production  although similar in palladium content  is almost all a low cost by product of nickel mining 
consequently  the company s operations  as currently configured  are only marginally competitive when palladium prices are low 
second  capital spending to extend the developed state of both mines and to expand smelting capacity will continue at higher than normal levels through this spending program has affected the company s cash generation capacity and liquidity 
although the company s capital spending in was well below plan  weak mine production still led to a drawdown of cash  and as a result liquidity declined during cash and short term investments declined to million at the end of from million at the end of  however  taking into account changes in working capital requirements and net cash  other working capital only declined by million in the same period 
capital expenditures projected for include major cash outlays for a second smelter furnace in columbus  and as a result liquidity is expected to decline further during  although recent increases in pgm prices may mitigate that effect 
separately  the company s liquidity also will become more sensitive to changes in metal prices during than it has been in recent years as the company s existing backlog of below market hedges on platinum winds down during the first half of 
table of contents third  the company s operating profile has been essentially that of one product  one operation and would benefit from diversification and growth  particularly in light of the historical volatility of the pgm markets 
extended periods of low pgm prices  particularly if the floor prices in the company s auto contracts are not renewed  could put both the company and its shareholders investment at risk 
while the company continues to view itself as a primary pgm producer and follows opportunities in the pgm sphere closely  attractive opportunities to further diversify within pgms are scarce and may do little to reduce the company s exposure to pgm price volatility 
growth in the recycling of spent pgm catalytic material has begun the process of an operational diversification while complementing the company s pgm base 
management believes it would be prudent and beneficial to stockholders to diversify the current operational structure 
in response to these structural issues  the company has implemented a number of key strategic initiatives intended to secure a sustainable future for the company and its stockholders transformation of the mines  market development for palladium and growth and diversification of the company s operations 
each initiative is intended to support sustainable development surrounding the company s business and is discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs 
each initiative is well underway and is evolving as the changes progress 
those involving external markets are beyond management s direct control for which a projection of specific results and timing is not possible 
transforming mining operations the company has identified a series of comprehensive operating changes designed to increase efficiency  reduce unit costs of production  and increase total pgm ounces produced  all in an effort to address the company s sustainability beyond should the company no longer have pgm pricing floors as in the current contracts with the auto companies 
these changes are grouped into five overlapping stages maintain and improve the current strong safety and environmental performance at all operations  increase the developed state of both mines  improving infrastructure and expanding proven reserves  apply more selective mining methods  better matching the method to the opportunity  increase ore production rates to realize economies of scale at both mines  reduce operating costs through mine optimization and addressing targeted efficiencies 
safety and environment since  the company has utilized a multi faceted program of continual improvement in safety for employees throughout the company 
the company s get guide  educate and train safe safety and health management systems focus on accident prevention  seeking safer methods of mining and increased employee awareness and training 
during  continued safety emphasis resulted in an incidence rate of reportable accidents per  hours worked  a reduction of from since the inception of the get safe in  the company s employee reportable accident rate has declined by a total of 
based on available government statistics for  it appears that the combined incidence rate for the company s mining operations was about below the national average for underground metal mines 
the company also monitors its environmental performance closely and works closely with local environmental groups through its good neighbor program to identify and address environmental concerns as they emerge 
the proximity of the company s operations to the absaroka beartooth wilderness area and yellowstone national park make environmental performance of paramount importance 
to date  the company s environmental performance has been excellent  and the company continues to dedicate substantial resources in support of this effort 
developed state in  the company continued its program to improve the developed state of both mines  thereby increasing proven ore reserves to facilitate operational planning and mining efficiency  and to add the necessary infrastructure support 
the developed state at both mines was intentionally decreased during the company s financial challenges beginning in late in the fall of  as palladium prices dropped sharply  the company curtailed development expenditures at the stillwater mine and brought the east boulder mine on line short of completion in order to conserve available cash 
at the same time  there was an effort to increase production in order to generate additional cash flow resulting in a steady contraction of proven ore reserves at both mines 
beginning in  with its capital structure back in order  the company expanded its capital spending program in order to grow its proven ore reserves and facilitate higher production rates in the future 
the company s ultimate 
table of contents objective has been to achieve and then maintain proven ore reserves at approximately months production at each mine or  at full permitted capacity  about million proven tons for the stillwater mine and million proven tons for the east boulder mine 
as this program approached completion  capital spending declined slightly to million in  from million in and million in capital spending for currently is forecast at million  which includes about million for the addition of a second furnace at the company s smelter 
results of the capital program included maintaining total proven ore reserves at million tons  even after taking into account production 
major infrastructure projects during included an expansion of surface facilities at the east boulder mine  and continuing development of an electric truck ramp and completion of a new ventilation portal at the stillwater mine 
primary development in company wide exceeded  feet of new footwall lateral and associated primary ramps  and  feet of diamond drilling  both somewhat lower than in as some of the company s development resources were redirected into production 
selective mining the use of mechanized bulk mining methods frequently requires mining widths and orientation not consistent with the ore reserve profiles in the company s mines 
after considerable study  the company concluded in that the inefficiencies of large mechanized mining methods in many cases may more than offset its benefits and so initiated a program to re introduce more selective mining methods in the mines 
changes to date have included introducing mechanized ramp and fill mining in the upper west area of the stillwater mine and in appropriate areas at the east boulder mine  and refinement of captive cut and fill stopes and other selective mining methods at both mines 
the transition effort is well underway 
the expected advantages of these changes are numerous  including higher realized ore grades  reduced secondary development to access the ore  reduced equipment needs with the accompanying benefits of lower capital and support costs  increased recovery of the ore reserve and decreased cost of primary development per ounce of production 
this change inherently allows greater access to mine reserves  generates less waste rock and can follow the ore trend more closely along the j m reef 
the use of mechanical bulk mining methods in the past was driven by a decision made to increase production rates when the palladium price was high and by the limited availability of the skilled manpower that captive cut and fill mining requires 
the change in mining methods has required some significant retraining and redeployment of the mine workforces 
progress to date on this initiative has been somewhat restricted by the availability of skilled miners 
increasing the percentage of mining in mechanized ramp and fill and captive cut and fill stopes is more manpower intensive than the previous mining methods  and there is a growing shortage of skilled miners 
as a result  during the company initiated a comprehensive program to train a new generation of underground miners for the future 
this effort requires dedicating substantial resources to recruiting and training over a period of several years 
these mining positions are high paying and offer an attractive career opportunity 
to date  the company has had no difficulty attracting interested candidates and the program provides a unique opportunity for the company to hire talent from local montana communities and to train them from the beginning in state of the art mining and safety practices 
however  it is now clear that the full benefit of such a program will take several years to achieve 
consequently  these adjustments to the company s mining methods initially have resulted in a modest reduction in total ore tons produced and have led to mining some lower grade areas that would not have been economic using prior mining methods 
with less equipment and development required  over time capital expenditure requirements will be reduced  along with maintenance and support costs 
ultimately  the intended net result is to increase ounces produced at a reduced cost per ounce 
production increases the company plans over the next several years to increase mine production to permitted capacity thereby increasing total pgm production and reducing unit cash costs 
estimated capacity at the stillwater mine is approximately  ore tons per day net of reprocessed slag  and capacity at the east boulder mine is approximately  ore tons per day  which would represent an increase of about over average production levels 
average daily production at the stillwater mine in was  tons  compared to  tons per day in however  the stillwater mine output reflects the labor disruption in that resulted from labor negotiations  as well as exceptionally high miner and maintenance attrition and the loss of experienced miners associated with a major schedule change at the mine 
the company intends to gradually increase production at the stillwater mine toward full capacity  but the rate of increase will be constrained for several years by the need to develop new miners or hire additional experienced miners 

table of contents average daily production at the east boulder mine in was  tons per day  a bit lower than the  tons per day produced during this decrease however  was essentially in line with the mine plan 
much of this decrease reflects the transitional challenges of introducing new mining methods and skills at the mine 
full permitted and operating capacity at the east boulder concentrator is approximately  tons per day 
recognizing the challenges inherent in shifting to more selective mining methods and training new miners  the company determined during to place less emphasis on growing production volumes until these other initiatives are solidly in place 
expanding smelter capacity with the continuing growth in the company s metallurgical processing volumes  both from increased mine production and from added recycling volumes  surplus furnace capacity at the smelter is becoming more restricted 
the furnace is lined with refractory brick that must be replaced periodically  requiring an extended four to five week shutdown of the smelter facility 
in the past  the company has simply stockpiled concentrates during the furnace shutdowns and has utilized the surplus capacity in the furnace to process the stockpiled material incrementally once the furnace came back online 
at the much higher level of furnace utilization experienced in and  following any future furnace rebricking there will not be enough surplus capacity to process the stockpiles accumulated during the shutdown 
thus  the company has determined to invest approximately million in to add a second smelting furnace 
the second furnace will eliminate this stage of processing as a bottleneck  provide backup in the event of a catastrophic furnace outage  and potentially will allow one of the furnaces to be used to increase recoveries of pgms from the smelter slag  freeing up additional concentrator capacity at the stillwater mine 
marketing palladium substantial marketing support for platinum has existed for many years through sponsoring industry organizations  while over the same period any corresponding support for palladium has been very limited 
recently  palladium has resurfaced as a primary jewelry metal  largely based on its favorable price position relative to gold and platinum 
the company has followed this development closely  championing and chronicling it for the industry and has undertaken a leadership role in promoting market development for palladium 
palladium used for jewelry in stillwater mining company s annual report  the company reported on the potential of palladium jewelry as an affordable alternative for white gold and platinum in the chinese jewelry markets  where its use had grown from almost nothing in to over million ounces in the company continues to work with various jewelry manufacturers outside of china  assisting in their development of palladium jewelry lines for us and european markets 
palladium wedding jewelry and accessories  including a bridal line  are now widely available in the us palladium chains are now being produced in italy for distribution worldwide 
palladium s lower price and lower comparative weight relative to white gold and platinum  combined with its high purity and attractive bright white appearance  appear to be driving this emerging popularity 
the company channels its efforts to develop and broaden markets for palladium through the palladium alliance international the pai  a trade organization the company established for that purpose in early the pai s principal goals include establishing palladium s jewelry market presence as a specific elegant brand of precious metal  distinct from platinum and white gold  and instituting a system of standards for use of the palladium brand that will emphasize palladium s rarity and value 
specifically  the pai has sponsored technical articles in jewelry trade publications illustrating methods of fabricating palladium jewelry  provides a website with information on palladium suppliers and retailers www 
luxurypalladium 
com  organizes presentations at industry trade shows and supports targeted image advertising in critical jewelry markets 
the pai works with palladium producers and fabricators and has invited their participation in its various programs 
during  the pai extended its efforts to position palladium jewelry in the market  primarily as an alternative to white gold 
these efforts have generated considerable interest within the jewelry industry 
palladium used for diesel engines several years ago  in response to the development of catalytic converters for diesel engines using only platinum  the company recognized and reported that the higher temperature stability of palladium could make it a useful adjunct to the use of platinum in reducing diesel particulate matter ie  soot emitted by diesel engines 
since then  this technology has been developed and implemented 
with the migration from clean gasoline engines using palladium rich catalytic converters to clean diesel engines which now enjoy over market share of new cars produced in europe and have potential for much broader use in other regions of the world platinum is the dominant pgm metal in catalytic converters for these vehicles 
however  partial substitution of palladium for platinum in diesel catalytic converters has been increasing over the past several years  largely driven by the relative economics 
the 
table of contents mandatory introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel in the united states during has also facilitated increased use of palladium in controlling diesel emissions 
palladium used for hydrogen energy the company has also turned its attention to potential applications for palladium in fuel cell technology and a future hydrogen economy 
significant research programs already exist with government and private funding in these areas  so the company has not seen any need for a direct role in funding palladium research at this time 
however  the company has encouraged the allocation of government research funds to this area  and has tracked published papers regarding research findings on topics of potential interest 
the company also has informally encouraged consideration of palladium as an alternative in applications that would appear to hold promise  particularly with regard to fuel cell technology 
diversification management is concerned with the approaching expiration of its automotive contracts and the volatility of metal prices  both of which are leading the company to consider proposals intended to strengthen its balance sheet 
in view of the controlling share ownership position held by norilsk nickel  the company expects to continue to discuss its future direction and alternatives with norilsk nickel in order to benefit from identified opportunities that may be proposed 
while the company regards itself as principally a palladium and platinum company  it has not limited its consideration of future growth opportunities to pgms  given the scarcity of pgm resources 
in  the company entered into a long term sourcing agreement for spent auto catalytic materials utilizing its smelter and base metal refinery to recycle these materials reclaiming them for reuse 
materials processed grew consistently in and  but during the company sharply increased the volume of material processed to approximately  ounces  up over the volumes processed in during  materials processed grew to approximately  ounces 
the company is exploring additional sources of catalyst material worldwide in an effort to continue growing this business 
a second smelting furnace is being constructed to provide both capacity and reliability of operation 
thus  growth in the recycling of spent pgm catalytic material has begun the process of an operational diversification while complementing the company s pgm base 
because mines  by their very nature  have a finite life  either through exhaustion of their minerals or exhaustion of their economics  mining companies often seek to reduce single mine risk by developing a portfolio of mines and reserve holdings 
in view of the scarcity of economically attractive pgm projects  the company believes that it should consider other metals and perhaps diversify its business 
the company produces gold  silver  nickel and copper as by products from its existing operations  each of which would be geologically and operationally compatible with the company s existing capabilities and expertise 
in  the company invested million to secure approximately an interest in pacific north west capital corp  a canadian exploration company that centers its efforts on identifying and defining potential pgm reserve targets 
management believes that gaining access to pacific north west capital corp 
s  seasoned exploration staff will result in a more effective exploration program than could be achieved using an internal exploration effort at this time 
the company invested an additional million in pacific north west capital corp 
during  thereby maintaining an interest and providing funding for exploration activities 
on july   the company invested million in benton resources corp  another canadian exploration company  providing the company with an opportunity for future participation in benton s goodchild project as well as an equity interest in benton itself 
based on reasonably favorable indications to date  the company intends to continue its participation in both programs during investments in generative exploration projects are inherently long term and speculative in nature  but are intended to build a portfolio of attractive opportunities for the future 
the company also is continuously evaluating various later stage mineral development projects  and in some cases the acquisition of operating properties or companies  when they appear to be in the best interests of shareholders 
capitalized mine development mine development expenditures incurred to increase existing production  develop new ore bodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized and amortized using a units of production method 
mine development expenditures include shafts  surface adits and underground infrastructure development  including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
these facilities generally are required not only for current operations  but also as continuing infrastructure in support of future planned operations 

table of contents the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production in each applicable area of the mine 
the amortization rate is based upon unamortized capitalized mine development costs and the related ore reserves 
capital development expenditures are added to the unamortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves  could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
probable ore reserves normally cannot be extracted without additional capital expenditures required to access and delineate them 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
specifically  the company amortizes capitalized mine development costs as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  to be amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all development costs of footwall laterals  ramps and associated facilities are amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and to access specific reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include secondary ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
revenues under the terms of sales contracts and purchase orders received from customers  the company recognizes revenue when the product is in a refined and saleable form and title passes  which is typically when the product is transferred from the account of the company to the account of the customer 
the company s revenue and earnings are significantly influenced by worldwide market prices of palladium and platinum  which can be volatile and over which the company has little or no control 
sales to significant customers represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although the company sells its metals to a small number of customers and brokers  the company believes it could  if the need were to arise  readily sell its metal on a spot basis and at spot prices in any of the various commodity markets throughout the world 
from time to time  the company has used basic hedging techniques involving fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards 
the objective of such metals hedging transactions has been to secure firm prices for the company s pgm production  to benefit from price increases or to protect against price decreases on that portion of production that falls outside the range of the floor or ceiling prices embedded in the company s long term sales contracts with the automotive companies 
such hedging arrangements may preclude the company from obtaining the full benefit of increased market prices for its contracted metals 
in  the company reported a charge against income of million as an offset to revenue  representing the difference between financially settled forward prices and actual market prices at the date of settlement all related to mine production 
in and  the corresponding charge against income was million and million  respectively 
see business and properties current operations pgm sales and hedging activities 
the company currently uses forward contracts and financially settled forwards to manage the potential negative effects of metal price volatility on its financial results 
during  the company entered into various fixed forwards and financially settled forward contracts  some of which were accounted for as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had financially settled forward contracts in place hedging  ounces of platinum sales through june the company also hedges metal from its recycling business  selling the metal forward at the same time it purchases the recycling material and so protecting itself from changes in market price until the recycled metal is 
table of contents outturned 
during  the company began using financially settled forward contracts to price recycled metal to be delivered under one of its automotive sales contracts 
the company has elected not to designate these financially settled forward arrangements as hedges for accounting purposes  consequently  they are marked to market in each reporting period with changes to the fair value of the contracts being recognized in revenue 
see business and properties current operations pgm sales and hedging activities 
the company has credit agreements with its major trading partners that provide for margin deposits in the event that forward prices for metals exceed the company s hedge contract prices by a predetermined margin limit 
as of december   no such margin deposits were outstanding or due 
the company s revenues  in terms of dollars and ounces sold  for  and were year ended december  sales revenues troy ounces sold in thousands palladium platinum rhodium other total palladium platinum rhodium total mine production pgm recycling other total mine production pgm recycling sales of palladium received in norilsk nickel transaction other total mine production pgm recycling sales of palladium received in norilsk nickel transaction other total sales of by products are reflected as a reduction to costs of metals sold and not as revenue 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
this increase was attributable to substantially higher market prices for platinum group metals  more than offsetting lower mine production and slightly lower recycling sales volumes 
reported revenues in both periods include the effect of floor and ceiling prices in the automotive sales agreements and of realized losses on platinum hedges 
revenues from mine production were million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
the decrease was attributable to the lower volume of mined ounces produced in ounces sold from mine production were  in  compared to  ounces in the average realization on these sales including the effects of hedging and of floor and ceiling prices in the underlying contracts was per ounce in and per ounce in revenues from pgm recycling grew during  increasing to million in  from million in recycled ounces sold  excluding tolled material  declined slightly in to  ounces compared to  ounces in  however  the company s combined average realization on recycling sales which include palladium  platinum and rhodium increased to  per ounce in from  per ounce in the company processed increased volumes of recycled materials on a tolling basis in the company toll processed approximately  ounces of pgms during  up from approximately  tolled ounces in total recycling volume increased to approximately  ounces of pgms in up from approximately  ounces in 
table of contents revenues from sales of purchased pgms  including sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  declined to million in from million in within these totals  sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction generated million in revenues during on sales of approximately  ounces of palladium from inventory at an average realization of per ounce 
these sales ended in the first quarter of when this palladium inventory was exhausted 
excluding the sales from the norilsk nickel transaction  the company purchased and resold nearly  ounces of palladium during and approximately  ounces of platinum  palladium and rhodium during one of the sales contracts associated with the norilsk nickel metal also required the company to provide  ounces of platinum and  ounces of rhodium per month  either purchased on the open market  produced from mining operations or sourced in the recycling business 
in  the company recognized other miscellaneous revenue of million for metal purchased in the open market and resold under these sales contracts  which terminated in the first quarter of costs of metals sold costs of metals sold  which excludes depreciation expense  was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
although the volume of purchased recycling material was relatively flat from year to year  higher pgm prices drove up the acquisition cost of the material  which largely accounted for an increase in recycling costs of metals sold to million in from million in the average acquisition cost of metal in the company s recycling business including platinum  palladium and rhodium increased to  per ounce in from  per ounce in  reflecting much higher average prices for pgms  and particularly for platinum and rhodium 
during  the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  including approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
this represents about a decrease from  during which the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  including approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
high employee attrition rates associated with a change in shift schedule and a brief labor strike at stillwater mine  coupled with lower average productivity from less experienced miners  largely drove the lower production in in response  the company also modestly reduced its emphasis on primary mine development during  allowing some resources previously dedicated to primary development to be redeployed into production 
the stillwater mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a decrease 
the east boulder mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a year on year decrease 
these production decreases  again  were attributable to workforce issues  partially offset by the redeployment of development resources into production 
the costs of metals sold from mine production  despite lower production  was almost flat year on year  increasing to million in  compared to million in the prior year  a increase 
although the company s mining costs generally increased during  higher metals prices resulted in an million increase in by product sales during the year  which the company recognizes as a credit against operating costs 
the costs of metals sold from other activities which in included sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and some associated sales was million in  compared to million in the two year program to sell the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction ended during the first quarter of the total cost in attributable to palladium sold from the ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction was million on the sale of  ounces at an average cost per ounce of just over the remaining cost of metal sold in represents mostly the cost of sourcing platinum and rhodium to meet related contractual commitments 
as discussed in revenues above  the company entered into sales contracts in  which required it to source metal from third parties in order to fulfill delivery commitments to customers 
the cost of metals sold from activities under these contracts  excluding sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  was million in depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
although amortization rates per ton mined were higher in than in  the lower tonnage produced in more than offset the effect of the higher tonnage rates 
exploration the company participated in several early stage exploration programs during and  spending about million and million on these programs during and  respectively 
in addition  the company 
table of contents expended approximately million and million in and  respectively  toward equity investments in exploration companies 
marketing the company expanded its market development efforts for palladium during  largely in support of the palladium alliance international  spending approximately million on marketing  up from million in general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  a decrease 
normal year on year increases in these costs were largely offset by benefit forfeitures and share based compensation adjustments 
interest income and expense interest income increased to million in from million in  reflecting increased interest on recycling volumes 
the company s balance of cash and related liquid assets earning interest decreased to million at december   from million reported at december  this decrease was partially attributable to growth in working capital in the company s recycling business 
inventories and advances associated with recycling increased to million at year end from million at the end of the company has reduced its debt to million at december  from million at december  interest expense declined very slightly to million in from million in on the reduced debt balances 
total income tax provision the company recorded only de minimis income tax expense in and  reflecting certain state minimum taxes paid 
changes in the company s net deferred tax assets have been offset by the change in the related valuation allowance 
other comprehensive income loss  net of tax the company recorded a gain in other comprehensive income of million in compared to a gain of million in the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and million of unrealized gains on investments 
the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and  of unrealized loss on investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
most of the increase was attributable to much higher sales volumes in the company s recycling business in  as well as higher market prices for the platinum group metals 
revenues from mine production were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase was attributable both to higher mine production in and to higher pgm prices 
ounces sold from mine production were  in  compared to  ounces in the average realization on these sales including the effects of hedging and of floor and ceiling prices in the underlying contracts was per ounce in and per ounce in revenues from pgm recycling grew substantially  increasing to million in  from million in  as volumes of recycled material processed increased sharply in recycled ounces sold  excluding tolled material  nearly doubled in to  ounces compared to  ounces in the company s combined average realization on recycling sales which include palladium  platinum and rhodium was  per ounce in  up sharply from per ounce in the company processed lower volumes of recycled materials on a tolling basis in the company toll processed approximately  ounces of pgms  down from approximately  tolled ounces in revenues from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other miscellaneous revenues declined to million in from million in within these totals  sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction generated million in revenues during on sales of approximately  ounces of palladium from inventory at an average realization of per ounce 
these sales ended in the first quarter of when this palladium inventory was exhausted 
comparable palladium sales for generated million of revenue on  ounces sold  for an average realization of per ounce  reflecting a full year of these sales from inventory in  but at somewhat lower average realized prices 

table of contents one of the sales contracts providing for the sale and delivery of the palladium ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction also required the company to provide  ounces platinum and  ounces of rhodium per month  either purchased on the open market or produced from the company s mining operations 
the company recognized other miscellaneous revenue of million and million for metal purchased in the open market and resold under these sales contracts in and  respectively 
costs of metals sold costs of metals sold  which excludes depreciation expense  was million in  compared to million in  an increase 
the substantial growth in recycling volumes during was accompanied by million of increased cost in purchasing the recycled catalyst 
partially offsetting this increase was a million decrease in expense reflecting a much smaller volume of sales related to the inventory received in the norilsk nickel transaction including the platinum and rhodium ounces purchased in the open market and re sold under these contractual commitments 
the remaining million is largely the result of increased sales during during  the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  including approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
this represents about an increase from  during which the company s mining operations produced approximately  ounces of pgms  including approximately  and  ounces of palladium and platinum  respectively 
the company modestly reduced its emphasis on primary mine development during  allowing some resources previously dedicated during to primary development to be redeployed into production in the stillwater mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a increase 
the east boulder mine produced approximately  ounces of pgms in  compared with approximately  ounces of pgms in  a year on year increase 
these production increases  again  were attributable to the redeployment of resources into production in and  to a lesser extent  to continuing progress in enhancing the developed state of the mines 
the costs of metals sold from mine production was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the cost increase is driven mostly by the increase in ounces sold during  although cost of metal sold per ounce declined slightly from per ounce in to per ounce in with the production increase 
the costs of metals sold from pgm recycling activities was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase was about equally attributable to the higher metal equivalent prices paid in to acquire catalytic materials for recycling and to the volume growth in this business during the average cost of metal per ounce increased from in to  in  reflecting much higher average prices for pgms  particularly for rhodium 
the costs of metals sold from sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction and other activities was million in  compared to million in this decrease in was primarily due to completion of the two year program to sell the palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  that program ended in early the total cost attributable to palladium sold from just those ounces received in the norilsk nickel transaction was million in  representing the sale of approximately  ounces of palladium at an average cost of just over per ounce 
the corresponding cost of palladium in was million on the sale of  ounces at about the same average cost per ounce 
the remainder of these sales in both years represents mostly the cost of sourcing platinum and rhodium to meet contractual commitments 
as discussed in revenues above  the company entered into sales contracts in  which required it to source metal from third parties in order to fulfill delivery commitments to customers 
the cost of metals sold from activities under these contracts  excluding sales of palladium received in the norilsk nickel transaction  was million and million in and respectively 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million in  compared to million in  a increase 
this increase resulted from the additional depletion expense for capital development placed into service during  as well as from the increased production during exploration the company participated in an early stage exploration program during  spending about million 
there were no corresponding exploration expenditures during 
table of contents marketing the company expanded its market development efforts for palladium during  largely in support of the palladium alliance international  spending approximately million on marketing  up from million in general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in  compared to million in  a increase 
the increase in corporate costs was driven primarily by increased professional services and compensation costs in interest income and expense interest income increased to million in from million in  reflecting both increased interest on greater recycling volumes and higher interest rates as the us federal reserve board increased short term rates 
the company s balance of cash and related liquid assets earning interest decreased to million at december  from million at december  interest expense declined slightly to million in from million in on modestly reduced debt balances 
the company has reduced its outstanding debt to million at december  from million at december  total income tax provision the company has not recorded any income tax expense in or  other than for certain state minimum taxes paid 
changes in the company s net deferred tax assets have been offset by the change in the related valuation allowance 
other comprehensive income loss  net of tax the company recorded a gain in other comprehensive income of million in compared to a loss of million in the gain included million of realized hedging losses reclassified to income  partially offset by million representing the change in fair value of derivatives held  and  of unrealized loss on investments held for sale 
the loss included million of net unrealized losses on hedging transactions  and million of unrealized gain on investments held for sale liquidity and capital resources for  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to and million for and  respectively 
the company s net cash flow from operating activities is affected by several key factors  including net realized prices for its products  cash costs of production  and the level of pgm production from the mines 
at the pgm price levels prevailing at december   absent separate hedging arrangements  a change in the price of platinum generally would flow through almost dollar for dollar to cash flow from operations  subject only to price ceilings on of the mines platinum production to be sold under the company s long term sales contracts  and certain costs severance taxes and royalties on mine production which adjust upward or downward with market prices 
however  in addition to this price ceiling  as of december   the company has hedged forward a total of  ounces of its sales of mined platinum through june of in general  as of december   these hedges were fixed at platinum prices well below current market prices  and therefore the company s participation in increases or decreases in the price of platinum will be limited to the unhedged portion of production 
under the company s long term sales contracts for mined production  a change in the market price of palladium  at prices above about per ounce  would flow through directly to cash flow from operations  subject only to an offset for severance taxes and royalties that are based on the realized price 
at market prices for palladium below about per ounce  floor prices take affect that support the palladium price at or near that level on most of the mined palladium sales 
the company enters into fixed forward contracts that set the selling price of pgms in its recycling activities  so for outstanding recycling lots  a change in the market price of platinum and palladium on sales of recycling materials would have little or no effect on margins earned from this activity and on cash flow from operations 
however  a percentage change in market prices would affect margins on future lots by about the same percentage as the change in price 
it normally takes existing lots of recycling material two to three months from the date of receipt to flow through to sales 
changes in the cash costs of production generally flow through dollar for dollar into cash flow from operations 
a reduction due to grade in total mine production of  or about  ounces per year  would reduce cash flow from operations by an estimated million per year at the price and cost levels prevailing at december  the company s forecasts indicate that such a reduction in mine production  incurred in a single year  would not impair the company s ability to repay its outstanding debt or to maintain its planned level of capital expenditures  although a sustained or significantly larger reduction in mine production could adversely affect the company s financial position 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company s investing activities primarily represent capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and changes in highly liquid investments 
see note property  
table of contents plant and equipment to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
the company also expended million and million to acquire equity interests in two small exploration companies during and  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities in each of these years was primarily applied to repayments of debt under the company s credit facility and to cover capital lease payments 
at december   the company s available cash was million and it had million debt outstanding 
if highly liquid investments are included  the company s balance sheet liquidity increases to million  and unused revolving credit lines add another million of available liquidity 
letters of credit totaling million were outstanding under the revolving credit facility at december  during  the company will be required to make total payments of approximately million for scheduled principal reductions on its outstanding borrowings under the company s credit agreement 
the company  at interest rate levels prevailing at december   also will be required to pay approximately million in total interest payments during related to its outstanding debt obligations 
credit agreement on august   the company entered into a million credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that replaced the company s previous million credit facility 
the credit facility consists of a million term loan facility maturing july   bearing interest at a variable rate plus a margin london interbank offer rate libor plus  currently  basis points  or at december  and a million revolving credit facility bearing interest when drawn at a variable rate plus a margin libor plus basis points  or at december  expiring july  the revolving credit facility includes a letter of credit facility 
undrawn amounts under the letters of credit issued through this facility as of december   carry an annual fee of

in the company divided its sureties by location  adding million of additional letter of credit coverage at east boulder mine and providing million of letters of credit in support of reclamation obligations at the stillwater mine 
these added commitments reduced the amount available under the revolving credit facility to million at december  on november   the company entered into amendment no 
to the credit facility  which increased the interest rate spread over libor on the term loan to basis points from basis points 
this amendment also increased the permitted level of capital expenditures under the credit agreement in years through from million per year to million per year and authorized up to an additional million over and above these limits for the installation of a second smelter furnace at the company s processing facilities in columbus  montana 
the amendment also clarified the definition of debt in the credit agreement and authorized the company to increase its contractual palladium sales commitments up to the equivalent of of the company s annual mined palladium production  with the excess to be supplied from recycling or other sources

table of contents critical accounting policies mine development expenditures capitalization and amortization mining operations are inherently capital intensive  generally requiring substantial capital investment for the initial and concurrent development and infrastructure of the mine 
many of these expenditures are necessarily incurred well in advance of actual extraction of ore 
underground mining operations such as those conducted by the company require driving tunnels and sinking shafts that provide access to the underground orebody and construction and development of infrastructure  including electrical and ventilation systems  rail and other forms of transportation  shop facilities  material handling areas and hoisting systems 
ore mining and removal operations require significant underground facilities used to conduct mining operations and to transport the ore out of the mine to processing facilities located above ground 
contemporaneously with mining  additional development is undertaken to provide access to ongoing extensions of the orebody  allowing more ore to be produced 
in addition to the development costs that have been previously incurred  these ongoing development expenditures are necessary to access and support all future mining activities 
mine development expenditures incurred to date to increase existing production  develop new ore bodies or develop mineral property substantially in advance of production are capitalized 
mine development expenditures consist of vertical shafts  multiple surface adits and underground infrastructure development including footwall laterals  ramps  rail and transportation  electrical and ventilation systems  shop facilities  material handling areas  ore handling facilities  dewatering and pumping facilities 
many such facilities are required not only for current operations  but also for all future planned operations 
expenditures incurred to sustain existing production and access specific ore reserve blocks or stopes provide benefit to ore reserve production over limited periods of time secondary development and are charged to operations as incurred 
these costs include ramp and stope access excavations from primary haulage levels footwall laterals  stope material rehandling laydown excavations  stope ore and waste pass excavations and chute installations  stope ventilation raise excavations and stope utility and pipe raise excavations 
the company calculates amortization of capitalized mine development costs by the application of an amortization rate to current production 
the amortization rate is based upon un amortized capitalized mine development costs  and the related ore reserves 
capital development expenditures are added to the un amortized capitalized mine development costs as the related assets are placed into service 
in the calculation of the amortization rate  changes in ore reserves are accounted for as a prospective change in estimate 
ore reserves and the further benefit of capitalized mine development costs are based on significant management assumptions 
any changes in these assumptions  such as a change in the mine plan or a change in estimated proven and probable ore reserves could have a material effect on the expected period of benefit resulting in a potentially significant change in the amortization rate and or the valuations of related assets 
the company s proven ore reserves are generally expected to be extracted utilizing its existing mine development infrastructure 
additional capital expenditures will be required to access the company s estimated probable ore reserves 
these anticipated capital expenditures are not included in the current calculation of depreciation and amortization 
the company s method of accounting for development costs is as follows unamortized costs of the shaft at the stillwater mine and the initial development at the east boulder mine are treated as life of mine infrastructure costs  amortized over total proven and probable reserves at each location  and all ongoing development costs of footwall laterals  ramps and associated facilities are amortized over the ore reserves in the immediate and geologically relevant vicinity of the development 
the calculation of the amortization rate  and therefore the annual amortization charge to operations  could be materially affected to the extent that actual production in the future is different from current forecasts of production based on proven and probable ore reserves 
this would generally occur to the extent that there were significant changes in any of the factors or assumptions used in determining ore reserves 
these factors could include an expansion of proven and probable ore reserves through development activities  differences between estimated and actual costs of mining due to differences in grade or metal recovery rates  and differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price assumptions used in the estimation of ore reserves 

table of contents asset impairment the company follows statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews and evaluates its long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is considered to exist if total estimated future cash flows on an undiscounted basis are less than the carrying amount of the asset 
future cash flows include estimates of recoverable ounces  pgm prices considering current and historical prices  long term sales contract prices  price trends and related factors  production levels  and capital and reclamation expenditures  all based on life of mine plans and projections 
if the assets are impaired  a calculation of fair market value is performed  and if fair market value is lower than the carrying value of the assets  the assets are reduced to their fair market value 
in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas no 
 the company has determined that the carrying value of the company s assets was not impaired at december  or december  income taxes income taxes are determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax rates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
each quarter  management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance has been provided at december   and december   for the portion of the company s net deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
based on the company s current financial projections  and in view of the level of tax depreciation and depletion deductions available  it appears unlikely that the company will owe any income taxes for the foreseeable future 
however  if average realized pgm prices were to increase substantially in the future  the company could owe income taxes prospectively on the resulting higher taxable income 
post closure reclamation costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the company recognizes the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying amount of the associated asset and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation ultimately is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss at the time of settlement 
accounting for reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates for each mining operation of the future costs the company will incur to complete final reclamation work required to comply with existing laws and regulations 
actual costs incurred in future periods could differ from amounts estimated 
additionally  future changes to environmental laws and regulations could increase the extent of reclamation and remediation work that the company is required to perform 
any such increases in future costs could materially impact the amounts charged to operations for reclamation and remediation 

table of contents the company reviewed its asset retirement assumptions at december  and determined that a net increase of million related to the stillwater mine was necessary 
see note asset retirement obligation to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
derivative instruments from time to time  the company enters into derivative financial instruments  including fixed forwards  cashless put and call option collars and financially settled forwards to manage the effect of changes in the prices of palladium and platinum on the company s revenue 
the company accounts for its derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires that derivatives be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and  if the derivative is not designated as a hedging instrument  changes in fair value must be recognized in earnings in the period of change 
if the derivative is designated as a hedge and to the extent such hedge is determined to be highly effective  changes in fair value are either a offset by the change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability if applicable or b reported as a component of other comprehensive income in the period of change  and subsequently recognized in the determination of net income in the period the offsetting hedged transaction occurs 
the company primarily uses derivatives to hedge metal prices and to manage interest rate risk 
the company also enters into financially settled forwards related to its recycling business segment which are not accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the realized and unrealized gains or losses are recognized in net income in each period 
see note derivative instruments to the company s audited financial statements for further information 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of adverse changes in metal prices and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company produces and sells palladium  platinum and associated by product metals directly to its customers and also through third parties 
as a result  financial performance can be materially affected when prices for these commodities fluctuate 
in order to manage commodity price risk and to reduce the impact of fluctuation in prices  the company enters into long term contracts and from time to time uses various derivative financial instruments 
because the company hedges only with instruments that have a high correlation with the value of the hedged transactions  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged transaction 
the company has entered into long term sales contracts with ford motor company  general motors corporation  and mitsubishi corporation 
the mitsubishi sales agreement expired at december   and a significant share of the pgm volumes previously committed to mitsubishi have been assumed under the provisions of the remaining contracts 
the contracts together cover significant portions of the company s mined pgm production through december and stipulate floor and ceiling prices for some of the covered production 
the company from time to time also purchases platinum and rhodium in the open market for resale under various supply arrangements 
see business and properties current operations pgm sales and hedging activities and note derivative instruments to the company s audited financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company s open positions 
beginning in the third quarter of  the major us bond rating agencies successively downgraded the corporate ratings of ford motor company and general motors corporation the company s two primary customers under long term sales contracts 
as a result  the debt of these companies no longer qualifies as investment grade 
the company s business is substantially dependent on its contracts with ford and general motors  particularly because the floor prices in these contracts provide significant price protection to the company in periods of low palladium prices 
under applicable law  these contracts may be void or voidable if ford or general motors becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy 
the loss of either of these contracts could require the company to sell at prevailing market prices  which might expose it to lower metal prices as compared to the floor prices under the contracts 
in such an event  the company s operating plans 
table of contents could be threatened 
in addition  under the company s credit facility  a default or modification of these contracts could prohibit additional loans or require the immediate repayment of outstanding loans 
thus  termination of these contracts could have a material adverse impact on the company s operations and viability 
the company from time to time enters into fixed forward sales and financially settled forward sales transactions that may or may not be accounted for as cash flow hedges to mitigate the price risk in its pgm recycling and mine production activities
