overview we were founded in may by experienced industry leaders with a vision to improve the performance of wide area distributed computing 
having significant experience in caching technology  our executive management team understood that existing approaches failed to address adequately all of the root causes of this poor performance 
we determined that these performance problems could be best solved by simultaneously addressing inefficiencies in software applications and wide area networks  or wans  as well as insufficient or unavailable bandwidth 
this innovative approach served as the foundation of the development of our products 
we began commercial shipments of our products in may and have since sold our products to over  customers worldwide 
we now offer models of our steelhead appliances as well as our central management console  interceptor and steelhead mobile product line 
in august we began selling our new steelhead mobile product line  which includes a software client version of our steelhead appliances  which delivers lan like application performance to any employee laptop  whether on the road  working from home or connected wirelessly in the office 
we are headquartered in san francisco  california 
our personnel are located throughout the united states and in over twenty countries worldwide 
we expect to continue to add personnel in the united states and internationally to provide additional geographic sales  research and development  general and administrative  and technical support coverage 
in september  we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  of common stock in which we sold and issued  shares of our common stock  at an issue price of per share 
we raised a total of million in gross proceeds from the ipo  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 
upon the closing of the ipo  all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock automatically converted into  shares of common stock 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering of common stock in which we sold and issued  shares of our common stock  including  shares sold by us pursuant to the underwriters partial exercise of their over allotment option  at an issue price of per share 
as a result of the offering  we raised a total of million in gross proceeds  or approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and other offering costs of million 

table of contents outlook 
we believe that our current value proposition  which enables customers to improve the performance of their applications and access to their data across wans  while also offering the ability to simplify it infrastructure and realize significant capital and operations cost savings  should allow us to continue to grow our business 
our product revenue growth rate will depend significantly on continued growth in the wide area data services  or wds  market and our ability to continue to attract new customers in that market and generate additional sales from existing customers 
our growth in support and services revenue is dependent upon increasing the number of products under support contracts  which is dependent on both growing our installed base of customers and renewing existing support contracts 
our future profitability and rate of growth will be directly affected by the continued acceptance of our products in the marketplace  as well as the timing and size of orders  product mix  average selling prices and costs of our products and general economic conditions 
our ability to maintain profitability will also be affected by the extent to which we must incur additional expenses to expand our sales  marketing  development  and general and administrative capabilities to grow our business 
the largest component of our expenses is personnel costs 
personnel costs consist of salaries  benefits and incentive compensation for our employees  including commissions for sales personnel and stock based compensation 
we expect that each of these expenses will continue to grow in absolute dollars and generally decrease as a percentage of revenue over time 
revenue 
we derive our revenue from sales of our products and support and services 
our revenue has grown rapidly since we began shipping products in may  increasing from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  as of december   our products had been sold to over  customers 
we sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through resellers 
we derived of our revenue through indirect channels in the year ended december  we expect revenue from resellers to continue to constitute a substantial majority of our future revenue 
cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue consists of the costs of appliance hardware  manufacturing personnel  manufacturing  shipping and logistics costs  and expenses for inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations 
we utilize third parties to jointly develop and manufacture our appliance hardware  embed our proprietary software and perform shipping logistics 
cost of support and service revenue is primarily comprised of the personnel costs of providing technical support and professional services 
cost of ratable product and related support and services consists of hardware  support and service costs related to transactions recognized ratably 
as we expand internationally and into other sectors  we may incur additional costs to conform our products to comply with local laws or local product specifications 
in addition  as we expand internationally  we will continue to hire additional technical support personnel to support our growing international customer base 
gross margin 
our gross margin has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix and average selling prices of our products  new product introductions and enhancements  the cost of our appliance hardware  cost of support and services personnel  and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
operating expenses 
operating expenses consist of sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses 
personnel related costs are the most significant component of each of these expense categories 
we grew from employees at december  to employees at december  we expect to continue to hire large numbers of new employees to support our anticipated growth 
the timing of these additional hires has and could materially affect our operating expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue  in any particular period 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses represent the largest component of our operating expenses and include personnel costs  sales commissions  marketing programs and facilities costs 
marketing programs are intended to generate revenue from new and existing customers  and are expensed as incurred 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we hire additional personnel and spend more on marketing programs with the intent to grow our revenue 
the majority of our international personnel are engaged in sales  marketing and support activities 
the percentage of sales and marketing expenses incurred internationally grew from in to in the year ended december  research and development expenses primarily include personnel costs and facilities costs 
quality assurance  infrastructure and related costs of product quality efforts are also included 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
we are devoting substantial resources to the continued development of additional functionality for existing products and the development of new products 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because we believe they are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
investments in research and development personnel costs are expected to increase in total dollars 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to our executive  finance  human resource  information technology and legal organizations  and fees for professional services 
professional services include outside legal  audit and information technology consulting costs 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january   we began to measure and recognize compensation expense for stock based awards at fair value  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r we accounted for stock options under the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb in the fourth quarter of  we implemented the employee stock purchase plan  or purchase plan 
under the purchase plan  employees may purchase shares of common stock at a price per share that is of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock as of the beginning or the end of a purchase period 
the purchase plan is compensatory and results in compensation expense accounted for under sfas r 
we expect to continue to incur significant stock based compensation expense 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net primarily includes interest income on cash and marketable securities 
cash has historically been invested in highly liquid investments such as time deposits held at major banks  commercial paper  united states government agency discount notes  money market mutual funds and other money market securities with maturities at the date of purchase of days or less 

in and  other income expense  net included the impact of recording our outstanding preferred stock warrants at fair value 
subsequent to our ipo  we were no longer required to re measure our warrants to fair value 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements could be adversely affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our 
table of contents more significant estimates and judgments and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  stock based compensation  income taxes  inventory valuation and allowances for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition our software is integrated on appliance hardware and is essential to the functionality of the product 
as a result  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  for all transactions involving the sale of software 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  delivery has occurred  which is when product title transfers to the customer  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable and free of contingencies and significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
product revenue consists of revenue from sales of our appliances and software licenses 
product sales include a perpetual license to our software 
product revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of title at shipment  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue 
product revenue on sales to resellers is recorded once we have received persuasive evidence of an end user and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
substantially all of our products have been sold in combination with product support services  which consist of software updates and support 
software updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades and to maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
support includes internet access to technical content  telephone and internet access to technical support personnel and hardware support 
revenue for support services is recognized on a straight line basis over the service contract term  which is typically one year 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue when a product agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
through december   in virtually all of our contracts  the only element that remained undelivered at the time of delivery of the product was support and updates 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the contract fee is recognized as product revenue 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue is generally deferred and recognized when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
when the undelivered element is support  revenue for the entire arrangement is bundled and recognized ratably over the support period 
revenue related to these arrangements is included in ratable product and related support and services revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
vsoe of fair value for elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those services when sold separately  and for product support and updates  is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
prior to the third quarter of  we had not established vsoe for the fair value of support contracts provided to our reseller class of customers 
as such  prior to the third quarter of  we recognized all revenue on transactions sold through resellers ratably over the term of the support contract  typically one year 
beginning in the third quarter of  we determined that we had established vsoe of fair value of support for products sold to resellers  and began recognizing product revenue upon title transfer at shipment  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition had been met 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement  generally based on specific products and quantities to be delivered 
substantially all of our contracts do 
table of contents not include rights of return or acceptance provisions 
to the extent that our agreements contain such terms  we recognize revenue once the acceptance provisions or right of return lapses 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized when the payments become due  provided the remaining criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
we assess the ability to collect from our customers based on a number of factors  including credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history of the customer 
if the customer is not deemed credit worthy  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until payment is received and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and financial accounting standards board interpretation  or fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb no 
and had adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas using the minimum value method 
in accordance with apb  stock based compensation expense  which is a non cash charge  resulted from stock option grants at exercise prices that  for financial reporting purposes  were deemed to be below the estimated fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
through december   we recorded deferred stock based compensation relative to these options of approximately million which is being amortized over the service period  which generally corresponds to the vesting period of the applicable options on a straight line basis 
during the years ended december   and respectively  we amortized million  million and of deferred compensation expense  net of reversals for terminations  relative to these options 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas r to new awards granted  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled  after the effective date 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized beginning january  is based on a combination of the following a the grant date fair value of stock option and employee stock purchase plan awards granted or modified after january   and b the amortization of deferred stock based compensation related to stock option awards granted prior to january   which was calculated using the intrinsic value method as previously permitted under apb under sfas r  we estimated the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we use the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yield of our common stock 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
options typically either vest with respect to of the shares one year after the options vesting commencement date and the remainder ratably on a monthly basis over the following three years  or ratably on a monthly basis over four years 
on september   we implemented our employee stock purchase plan  or purchase plan 
purchase plan shares typically vest over two years  and include two purchase dates per year 
the purchase plan became effective on the effective date of the registration statement relating to 
table of contents our ipo 
under the purchase plan  employees may purchase shares of common stock through payroll deductions at a price per share that is of the lesser of the fair market value of our common stock as of the beginning of an applicable offering period or the applicable purchase date  with purchases generally every six months 
the fair value of options granted and purchase plan shares were estimated at the date of grant using the following assumptions year ended december  employee and director stock options expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility weighted average fair value of grants purchase plan expected life in years risk free interest rate volatility weighted average fair value of grants the expected term represents the period that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
for the year ended december   we have elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term of stock options as permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin the computation of expected volatility for the year ended december  is based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry  financial and market capitalization data 
as required by sfas r  we estimated expected forfeitures and are recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
as of december   total compensation cost related to stock options granted under sfas r to employees and directors but not yet recognized as of december  was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of million 
this cost will be amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period  which is typically years 
amortization in the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
as of december   there was million left to be amortized under our purchase plan  which will be amortized over the remaining purchase plan offering period  which is between and months 
amortization in the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
in accordance with sfas r  we have presented the cash related tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options as financing cash flows for the year ended december  tax benefits presented as financing cash flows for the year ended december  were  tax benefits related to stock option exercises for options granted before the adoption of sfas r are presented as operating cash flows 
accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  accounting for income taxes  sfas 
under this method  income tax expenses or benefits are recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax 
table of contents returns 
the measurement of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on provisions of currently enacted tax laws 
the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not contemplated 
as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes and tax contingencies in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax purposes versus financial accounting purposes that may create net deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our historical levels of income  expectations of future taxable income and on going tax planning strategies 
because of the uncertainty of the realization of the deferred tax assets  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
in june  fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
in the first step  recognition  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable  or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability  or both 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be de recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  and accrued approximately  as of december  as a result 
we have also recognized a decrease in our deferred tax asset of  as of december  we have elected to record interest and penalties recognized in accordance with fin in the financial statements as income taxes 
inventory valuation inventory consists of hardware and related component parts and is stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
a portion of our inventory relates to evaluation units located at customer locations as some of our customers test our equipment prior to purchasing 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand is written down to its estimated realizable value based on historical usage  expected demand  and evaluation unit conversion rate and age 
inherent in our estimates of market value in determining inventory valuation are estimates related to economic trends  future demand for our products and technological obsolescence of our products 
inventory write downs are reflected as cost of product and amounted to approximately million  million and  for the years ended december   and 
table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the applicable portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  and at december  and results of operations revenue we derive our revenue from sales of our appliances with bundled software licenses and from product support and services 
we began shipping our products in may product revenue primarily consists of revenue from sales of our steelhead products and is typically recognized upon shipment 
support and services revenue includes unspecified software license updates and product support 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual period  which is typically one year 
service revenue includes professional services and training  which to date has not been significant  and is recognized as the services are performed 
ratable product and related support and services revenue includes revenue from arrangements in which product and support are bundled and no vsoe of fair value for support pricing in the arrangements exists 
the total revenue from these arrangements is recognized ratably over the support period  typically one year

table of contents compared to product revenue increased in due primarily to an increase in new customers and additional purchases by existing customers 
as of december   our products had been sold to over  customers  compared to approximately  as of december  we believe the market for our products has grown due to increased market awareness of wide area data services and distributed organizations  which increases dependence on timely access to data and applications 
substantially all of our customers purchase support when they purchase our products 
the increase in support and services revenue on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total revenues is a result of increased product and first year support sales combined with the renewal of support contracts by existing customers 
as our customer base grows  we expect the proportion of revenue generated from support and services to increase 
in the year ended december   we derived of our revenue from indirect channels compared to in the year ended december  this increase in indirect channel revenue is due to our increased focus on expanding our indirect channel sales 
we expect indirect channel revenue to continue to be a significant portion of our revenue

the increase in ratable product and related support and services revenue in the year ended december  was due to the amortization of revenue from one of our oem arrangements 
prior to the second quarter of  we had undelivered obligations to this oem and all revenue relating to this arrangement was deferred 
in the quarter ended june   we satisfied all future obligations to this oem  except for support 
as such  in the second quarter we began amortizing revenue relating to this arrangement over the remaining support period for each sale made under the arrangement 
in the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue associated with this arrangement 
in the year ended december   we derived of our revenue from indirect channels compared to in the year ended december  due to our increased focus on expanding our indirect sales channels

we expect future sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase and continue to be our most significant operating expense 
generally sales personnel are not immediately productive and sales and marketing expenses do not immediately result in revenue 
hiring additional sales personnel reduces short term operating margins until the sales personnel become productive and generate revenue 
accordingly  the timing of sales personnel hiring and the rate at which they become productive will affect our future performance

provision for income taxes prior to the first quarter of  we had incurred operating losses and  accordingly  had not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented other than foreign provisions for income tax 
for the year ended december   we generated operating profits 
after applying our available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  our tax provision accrued for the year ended december  consists of federal  foreign and state provisions for income tax 

table of contents since inception  we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to operating losses incurred 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
if not utilized  the federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire between and while the foreign net operating losses do not expire 
utilization of the federal and state net operating losses and credit carryforwards is subject to annual limitation that are applicable when we experienced an ownership change  by a change in significant stockholder allocation or equity structure 
if our recent trend of profitability continues  we may determine that there is sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of  or decrease in  the valuation allowance 
if we were to reverse all or some part of our valuation allowance and recognize all or some part of our deferred tax assets  our financial statements in the period of reversal would likely reflect an increase in assets on our balance sheet and a corresponding tax benefit to our statement of operations in the amount of the reversal 
our effective tax rate for has fluctuated on a quarterly basis 
our effective tax rate is and can be affected by such items as disqualifying dispositions of stock from the purchase plan and incentive stock options  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to potential income tax audits on open tax years by any taxing jurisdiction for which we operate in 
the taxing authorities of the most significant jurisdictions are the united states internal revenue service  california franchise tax board and hm revenue and customs in the united kingdom 
since all filed federal and california franchise tax returns have shown operating losses  we do not anticipate any material adjustments to the provisions relating to these returns 
the statute of limitations for federal  state  and uk tax purposes are generally three  four  and three years respectively  however  we continue to carryover tax attributes prior to these periods for federal and state purposes  which would still be open for examination by the respective tax authorities 
all years since our inception are open to tax examinations 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters ended december  in management s opinion  the data has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  and reflects all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of this data

as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance 
in addition  a significant portion of our quarterly sales typically occurs during the last month of the quarter  which we believe reflects customer buying patterns of products similar to ours and other products in the technology industry generally 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict even in the near term 
commencing with the first shipment of our products in the second quarter of  revenue has increased sequentially each quarter  due to increases in the number of products sold to new and existing customers and international expansion 
cost of revenue has increased sequentially each quarter in absolute dollars  however  has decreased over time as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in gross margins is primarily due to higher margins on product revenue as a result of lower unit product costs 
operating expenses in all quarters increased sequentially as we continued to add headcount and related costs to accommodate our growing business 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december  in thousands working capital cash and cash equivalents marketable securities year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments in time deposits held at major banks  commercial paper  united states government agency discount notes  money market mutual funds and other money market securities with original maturities at the date of purchase of days or less 
marketable securities consist of government sponsored enterprise obligations and corporate bonds and notes 
as of december  and  the marketable securities are recorded at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
pursuant to certain lease agreements and as security for our merchant services agreement with our financial institution  we are required to maintain cash reserves  classified as restricted cash 
current restricted cash totaled  at december  and  at december   and long term restricted cash totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
long term restricted cash is included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consists primarily of funds held as collateral for letters of credit for the security deposit on the leases of our corporate headquarters and is restricted until the end of the lease terms on august  and july  since the fourth quarter of  we have expanded our operations internationally 
our sales contracts are principally denominated in united states dollars and as such  the increase in our revenue derived from international customers  has not affected our cash flows from operations 
as we fund our international operations  our cash and cash equivalents are affected by changes in exchange rates 
to date  the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been material 
cash flows from operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  product costs  outside services and rent payments 
our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we grow our revenue and spend on hiring personnel in order to grow our business 
the timing of hiring sales personnel in particular affects cash flows as there is a lag between the hiring of sales personnel and the generation of revenue and cash flows from sales personnel 
cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december  primarily due to increased profitability 
in the first nine months of  we experienced negative cash flows from operations as we continued to expand our business and build our infrastructure domestically and internationally 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities cash flows used in investing activities primarily relate to investments in marketable securities and capital expenditures to support our growth 
cash used in investing activities increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to additional purchases of marketable securities 
additionally  capital expenditures increased in compared to primarily resulting from leasehold improvement additions associated with our new corporate headquarters and software purchased for internal use associated with our erp system 
restricted cash outlays increased in due to the cash collateralized million letter of credit required for our new corporate headquarters 
cash flows from financing activities prior to september  we financed our operations primarily through private sales of convertible preferred stock totaling million and collections from customers and  to a lesser extent  borrowings under our credit facility

in september  we completed our ipo and received net proceeds of million 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering of our common stock and received net proceeds of million 
on june   we entered into a loan and security agreement with a financial institution for a million credit facility  and we borrowed million and million in and  respectively 
we made principal payments of  in the first six months of and repaid the remaining balance on our loan on october  in addition to proceeds from our follow on offering of common stock  cash flows from financing activities in the year ended december  consisted of cash proceeds and tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under our purchase plan 
we believe that our net proceeds from operations  together with our cash and marketable securities balances at december   will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the timing and extent of expansion into new territories  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we may enter into arrangements for potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  services or technologies  which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes  nor did we have any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 
other at december  and  we did not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such debt arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements that could have an effect on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk our sales contracts are principally denominated in united states dollars and therefore our revenue is not subject to foreign currency risk 
we do incur certain operating expenses in currencies other than the us dollar and therefore are subject to volatility in cash flows due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound  euro  australian dollar and singapore dollar 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging contracts since exchange rate fluctuations have had minimal impact on our operating results and cash flows 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with a maturity of ninety days or less at the time of purchase 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market securities  us treasury bills  us agency discount notes and commercial paper 
due to the high investment quality and short duration of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair market value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates had fallen by in  our interest income on cash and cash equivalents would have declined approximately  assuming consistent investment levels
