item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
see business risks and uncertainties regarding certain factors known to genvec that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results  including discussions of the risks related to the development  regulatory approval  manufacture  proprietary protection of our product candidates  and their market success relative to alternative products 
overview genvec  inc genvec  we  our  or the company is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company working to develop and commercialize innovative gene based therapies to treat cancer  vision and hearing loss and balance disorders  and vaccines to prevent infectious diseases 
we combine our patented and or patent pending gene transfer technologies with proprietary therapeutic genes to create product candidates  such as tnferade for cancer  currently in a pivotal trial for locally advanced pancreatic cancer  theratoh for hearing and balance impairment  and adpedf for age related macular degeneration 
using the same gene transfer technology we are also collaborating with the us government and path s malaria vaccine initiative mvi for the development of vaccine candidates against infectious diseases  for the prevention of malaria  hiv  respiratory syncytial virus  hsv and influenza  and an animal health vaccine for the prevention of foot and mouth disease 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue  as resources permit  the research and development of a range of product candidates for a variety of indications 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase 
our product candidates also have not yet received regulatory approvals  either from the fda for the united states or from regulatory agencies outside of the united states  which approvals are required before we can market them as therapeutic and or vaccine products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval in the united states  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
historically  the results from pre clinical testing and early clinical trials have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs and biologies have shown promising results in early clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our business strategy includes the option of entering into collaborative arrangements with third parties to complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one or more of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  and how such arrangements would affect our development plan or capital requirements 
our programs may also benefit from subsidies  grants  or government  or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  we are unable to estimate the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  if ever  and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
our research and development expenses were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these expenses were divided between our research and development platforms in the following manner year ended december  in millions tnferade vaccines other clinical programs total tnferade 
our lead cancer product candidate is currently being studied in a pivotal clinical trial for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer  in phase ii trials for rectal cancer and metastatic melanoma cancer and two phase i ii trials for head and neck cancer 
genvec has incurred million of expenses on the development of this product candidate since the commencement of this program in costs since the commencement of this program include research  development  clinical trials  clinical supply costs  and an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses 
genvec expects to continue to expend substantial additional amounts for the clinical development and commercialization of tnferade 
vaccines 
under the company s corporate and government funded vaccine programs  genvec continues to develop vaccine candidates against malaria  hiv  respiratory syncytial virus  and other infectious diseases  as well as an animal health vaccine for foot and mouth disease fmd 
since commencement of these vaccine development programs in  genvec has incurred approximately million in research and development costs  including an allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  most of which has been funded by the various sponsors under cost reimbursement agreements 
to date  none of our proprietary or collaborative programs has resulted in a commercial product  therefore  we have not received any revenues or royalties from the sale of products 
we have funded our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities  payments received under collaborative programs with public and private entities  and debt financings 
we have incurred operating losses each year since inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in research and development and from general and administrative activities 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  sponsored research costs  patent costs  technology access fees  clinical trial costs  and other expenses related to our product development and research programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefit expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  facility costs  professional fees  business development costs  insurance premiums  and other general corporate expenditures 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  our management evaluates its estimates using authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while we base estimates and assumptions on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions 
for a discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical because they require significant estimates or judgment on the part of management revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
consequently  the company recognizes revenues when a contract is executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of the service or products has occurred  and collectability of the contract amounts is considered probable 
the company s collaborative research and development agreements can provide for up front license fees  research payments  and or milestone payments 
in accordance with sab  up front nonrefundable fees associated with license and development agreements where the company has continuing involvement in the agreement  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the estimated service period 
if the estimated service period is subsequently modified  the period over which the up front fee is recognized is modified accordingly on a prospective basis 
non refundable research and development fees for which no future performance obligations exist are recognized when collection is assured 
research and development revenue from cost reimbursement and cost plus fixed fee agreements is recognized as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revisions in revenues  cost  and billing factors eg indirect rate estimates are accounted for in the period of change 
reimbursable costs under such contracts are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment 
contract revenues and accounts receivable reported in the financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be received 
contract revenues are adjusted to actual upon final audit and retroactive adjustment 
estimated contractual allowances are provided based on management s evaluation of current contract terms and past experience with disallowed costs and reimbursement levels 
payments received in advance of work performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
clinical trial expenses and research and development activities 
we accrue estimated costs for clinical and pre clinical studies based on estimates of work performed 
we believe that this method best aligns the expenses the company records with the efforts it expends 
we monitor the progress of the trials and their related activities to the extent possible and adjust the accruals accordingly 
adjustments to accruals are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the adjustment become known  all adjustments to date have been inconsequential 
the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type genvec generally conducts are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion date phase i years phase ii years phase iii years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
we test potential product candidates in pre clinical studies to identify indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for certain indications in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value in the context of accounting and financial reporting and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap 
sfas also expands the required disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
in january  the fasb deferred the effective date of sfas for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities to the first quarter of sfas is effective for financial assets and liabilities in the first quarter of the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas allows companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value 
sfas is effective in the first quarter of the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in june  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf applies to non refundable advance payments to acquire goods or pay for services that will be consumed or performed in a future period in conducting research and development activities on behalf of the entity 
the consensus on eitf states such advance payments should be recorded as an asset when the advance payments are made 
capitalized amounts should be recognized as expense when the research and development activities are performed  that is  when the goods without alternative future use are acquired or the service is rendered 
the consensus should be applied prospectively to new contractual arrangements entered into in fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of eitf when applied to the recently signed cobra agreement will have a material impact on the timing of the company s recognition of expense under this agreement since the cobra agreement has an advance payment 
in december  the fasb emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements 
the eitf concluded on the definition of a collaborative arrangement and that revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in eitf and other accounting literature 
based on the nature of the arrangement  payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and its terms  the nature of the entity s business  and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature would be presented 
companies are also required to disclose the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however required disclosure under eitf applies to the entire collaborative agreement 
eitf is effective for us january  and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue decreased percent to million in from million in the decrease in revenue is primarily a result of the successful completion of the one time production of clinical grade hiv vaccine supplies for a phase iib proof of concept trial to be conducted by nih for which we were reimbursed under our contract 
this resulted in a year to year reduction of million in revenues 
the decrease is also due  to a lesser extent  to the expiration of funding of our collaboration with fuso pharmaceutical industries of japan  effective december   for the development of targeted cancer therapies 
these decreases were partially offset by revenue earned under our year contract signed in january with the dhs for the development of vaccine and anti viral candidates for the prevention and containment of fmd 
this contract has resulted in a year to year increase of million in revenues 
to a lesser degree  revenue declines were partially offset by the additional funding the company received and recognized under its amended and extended collaborative research  development  and supply agreement with the path malaria vaccine initiative to continue advancing a new multivalent malaria vaccine toward clinical evaluation 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased percent to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower pass through costs under our nih funded hiv vaccine development contract 
the decrease was partially offset by higher costs related to the continuing clinical evaluation of tnferade in our pivotal trial for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer and increased personnel costs which includes an increase of approximately  of stock based compensation expense in as compared to the prior year 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were lower in primarily due to decreased professional fees  facilities and depreciation costs  partially offset by higher administrative personnel costs including severance expenses of approximately  for former employees  and an increase of approximately  of stock based compensation expense in as compared to the prior year 
loss on disposal of assets 
there was a loss on disposal of assets of  in and no loss in the loss in of million represents the loss associated with the sale of the myoblast cell therapy assets to mytogen 
other income loss total other income increased to million in from  in interest income was million in as compared to million in the comparable prior year period 
the increase in interest income is due to higher investment balances as well as higher yields earned on our portfolio 
interest expense  net of the change in the fair market value of the kingsbridge warrants decreased  for the period ending december  as compared to the comparable prior year period 
this was due to the declining balances of our debt obligations and a reduction in interest expense due to a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability associated with our ceff with kingsbridge in as compared to the comparable period in other income loss increased  in resulting from the receipt of an insurance settlement of  due to a casualty loss and the receipt of equity  valued at  from a third party in exchange for the release of security interests 
years ended december  and revenue revenue 
revenue decreased percent to million in from million in the decrease in revenues is primarily a result of the successful completion of the one time production of clinical grade hiv vaccine supplies 
to a lesser degree  revenues declined due to the satisfactory completion of clinical material production  funded under our malaria vaccine contract with the us navy  for use in clinical testing that commenced in january  as well as lower reimbursable expenses incurred under our path s malaria vaccine initiative mvi vaccine development program 
these reductions were partially offset by an approximately million increase in revenue earned in under the previously announced million expansion of our usda funded program for the development of a foot and mouth disease vaccine 
revenues in also include approximately million in amortized revenues recognized under our development agreement with terumo corporation prior to the previously announced assignment of the agreement to mytogen  inc in december operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses decreased percent to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower pass through costs for the completed production in of clinical grade supplies of hiv and malaria vaccine candidates under our funded programs with nih and the us navy  respectively  as well as lower expenses incurred under our path s malaria vaccine initiative mvi vaccine development program 
these reductions were offset to a large extent by higher costs related to the continuing clinical evaluation of tnferade in our phase ii iii pivotal trial for the treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer  coupled with approximately  of stock based compensation expense recorded in connection with the company s adoption of sfas no 
r on january  general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased percent to million in from million in general and administrative expenses were higher in primarily due to increased costs for performance based compensation  recruitment and relocation expenses  and approximately  of stock based compensation expense recorded in connection with the company s adoption of sfas no 
r 
loss on disposal of assets 
the loss on disposal of assets decreased to in from million in due to the non cash write off of intangible assets in conjunction with the previously announced sale of the company s myoblast cell therapy assets in december other income loss other income loss increased from  in to  in other interest income increased from  in to million in due primarily to an increase in interest rates earned on invested balances 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in due to a year to year   change in the non cash market value of our interest rate swap agreement and lower interest charges due to debt repayments of  during liquidity and capital resources to date  we have been engaged primarily in research and development activities 
as a result  we have experienced and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future until one or more of our product candidates are commercialized 
as of december   we held million in cash and investments as compared to approximately million at december  net cash used in operating activities was million in compared with million used in net cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily reflecting net proceeds of million from issuance of stock under our ceff and  from purchases under stock incentive programs offset by debt repayments of  net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in  which consisted principally of the net proceeds of the sale and maturity of investment securities offset by the purchase of property and equipment totaling  as of december   our working capital was approximately million compared to million at december  historically we have entered into agreements with academic medical institutions and contract research organizations to perform research and development activities and with clinical sites for the treatment of patients under clinical protocols  additionally  in  we have recently entered into a contract manufacturing agreement for which we were obligated to pay a million non refundable reservation fee 
such contracts expire at various dates and have differing renewal and expiration clauses 
we also utilize different financing instruments  such as debt and capital and or operating leases  to finance various equipment and facility needs 
our external research  clinical study  and financing commitments are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years debt operating leases other total contractual obligations in addition  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties  as part of our in licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is not probable or reasonably estimable  such contingent obligations have not been recognized in our financial statements  and are not included above 
we also have a bond sinking fund requirement which totaled approximately  at december  such amount is not available for unrestricted use in current operations 
we expect our revenue for the next several years to consist primarily of payments under government grants and contracts and  to a lesser extent  interest income 
we intend to commit a significant portion of our resources on our lead product candidate  tnferade  for the treatment of cancer 
with respect to our other product candidates  we will seek to form strategic alliances under which we will share the risks and costs of development 
we also will continue to look for funded research collaborations to help offset future anticipated losses from operations 
some of these arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our existing or future technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  or to license the rights to our technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are not favorable to us 
we expect that significant additional financing will be required as we move our product candidates through clinical development  including the continued advancement of tnferade through the phase iii potion of the pivotal trial for locally advanced pancreatic cancer 
on march   we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital ltd  under which kingsbridge has committed to purchase  at our option  up to a total of million of the company s common stock over a year period  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
due to the pricing formula  however  the actual amount of additional financing available to us under the ceff may be substantially less than the committed amount 
in particular  kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares of common stock at a price lower than 
should we choose to utilize the ceff again  net proceeds from the sale of common stock under the ceff will help defray costs associated with expanded clinical testing of tnferade in locally advanced pancreatic cancer and or other indications and general corporate purposes 
as part of the ceff arrangement  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share 
the warrant became exercisable on september  and will remain exercisable until september  in june  we initiated our first draw against the ceff 
on june   subsequent to the first day pricing period  we sold  common shares for gross proceeds of million 
the second day pricing period ended on june  at which time we sold under the ceff   common shares for gross proceeds of million 
the variable weighted average price vwap of the company s stock during the first day pricing period was  which equals or exceeds the minimum purchase price of per share 
the vwap of our stock during the second day pricing period was  which equals or exceeds the minimum purchase price of per share 
on february   the company filed with the securities and exchange commission a million shelf registration statement on form s the shelf registration was declared effective february  and allows the company to obtain financing through the issuance of any combination of common stock  preferred stock  warrants  or debt 
to date  the company has not utilized the shelf registration but is eligible to do so at such time the company deems appropriate 
on december   the company sold  shares of common stock to various investors at per share under a prior shelf registration on form s declared effective on april  proceeds from this sale  net of offering costs  totaled million 
we are currently expecting to use approximately million in the months ending december   unless we pursue and obtain additional sources of funds in that timeframe 
our estimate includes approximately million in contractual obligations reflected in the table above  as well as million for capital expenditures  and the million non refundable reservation fee paid in january as part of the cobra manufacturing agreement 
we believe that our existing cash  and anticipated cash flows from our current collaborations and short term investments will be sufficient to support our operations for approximately months 
our estimated capital requirements will depend on  and could increase or decrease as a result of  many factors  including the extent to which we choose to develop our research  development  clinical  manufacturing  and commercialization activities 
we expect that significant additional capital will be required which we may seek through further public or private equity offerings  debt financing  additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  or some combination of these financing alternatives 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  investors likely will experience dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if we raise funds through the issuance of debt securities  those securities would have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of our common stock 
in addition  if we lack adequate funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research and development and or clinical programs 
as of december   we have net operating loss carryforwards to potentially reduce future federal and state taxable income  and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards available to potentially offset future federal and state income taxes 
use of our net operating loss and research and experimentation credit carryforwards may be limited due to changes in our ownership as defined within section of the internal revenue code 
at december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes which will expire at various dates through  and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards of million which will expire at various dates through the company also has capital loss carryforwards of million which will expire in off balance sheet obligations we had no off balance sheet obligations during fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as follows cash and cash equivalents million short term investments million our exposure to market risk is confined to cash and cash equivalents  which consist of instruments having original maturities of three months or less  and our short term investment portfolio 
we maintain a short term investment portfolio of investment grade government agency notes and corporate bonds 
the securities in our short term investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale  and are  due to their predominantly short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure on our investment portfolio 
as of december   securities totaling million are scheduled to mature in  the remaining million represents the value of the equity received in consideration of the company s release of security interest upon mytogen s acquisition by advanced cell technology  inc in while we do not believe that an increase in market rates of interest would have any significant negative impact on the realizable value of our investment portfolio  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flow and results of operations 
we are headquartered in the united states where we conduct our pre clinical research activities 
clinical trials are currently conducted in the united states and  to a lesser extent  europe 
clinical sites in other locations outside of the united states are evaluated as needed 
all revenues to date have been received in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
on december   we had an outstanding industrial revenue bond payable of million 
this bond bears interest at a variable rate based on libor 
during  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest rate over the life of the bond at percent plus a remarketing fee 
as of december   the fair value of the interest rate swap  excluding accrued interest  was  we also have outstanding loans totaling  at fixed interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
principal and interest on these loans is due and payable monthly
