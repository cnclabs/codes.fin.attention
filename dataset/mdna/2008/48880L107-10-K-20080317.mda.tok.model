company overview kendle international inc the company or kendle is a global clinical research organization cro that delivers integrated clinical development services  including clinical trial management  clinical data management  statistical analysis  medical writing  regulatory consulting and organizational meeting management and publications services  among other things  on a contract basis to the biopharmaceutical industry 
the company operates in north america  europe  asia pacific  latin america and africa 
the company operates its business in two reportable operating segments  early stage and late stage 
the early stage business currently focuses on the company s phase i operations while late stage is comprised of clinical development services related to phase ii through iv clinical trials  regulatory affairs and biometrics offerings 
the company aggregates its clinical development operating unit  regulatory affairs operating unit  and biometrics operating unit into the late stage segment under the aggregation criteria in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the aggregation criteria met includes a similar nature of services provided  a similar type of customer  similar methods used to distribute services  similar economic characteristics and a similar regulatory environment 
in addition  the company reports support functions primarily composed of human resources  information technology  sales and marketing and finance under the support and other category for purposes of segment reporting 
a portion of the costs incurred from the support units are allocated to the early and late stage reportable operating segments 
the company primarily earns net service revenues through performance under late stage segment full service contracts 
the company also recognizes revenues through limited service contracts  consulting contracts and early stage segment contracts 
the company s revenue recognition process is described later in this md a under critical accounting policies and estimates 
late stage segment contracts the company provides services to its customers primarily under full service contracts that include a broad range of services in support of a customer s clinical trial 
these services typically include biometrics  clinical development services and regulatory affairs 
the company from time to time provides a select number of these services under limited service contracts 
the company usually competes for business awards in a competitive bidding process 
in the bidding process  the company submits a bid that includes a price based upon hourly billing rates for billable employees multiplied by task hours the company estimates will be necessary to achieve the service assumptions 
upon receiving a business award  the company and its customer negotiate a contract to memorialize these assumptions and the related price 
service contracts usually are long term arrangements that require company performance over several years 
a contract usually requires a portion of the contract fee to be paid at the time of contract execution  and the balance is received in specified installments or milestones over the contract s duration 
other methods for receiving payment include units achieved and time and materials 
during performance of the services  any of the following events may occur and impact the contract price the customer may request a change in the assumptions  the customer may increase or decrease the scope of services  which requires a change to the service assumptions  and the company may discover that  for a particular contract  the assumptions are incorrect or insufficient to permit completion of the contract 
in each of the foregoing situations  the company enters into negotiations for a contract amendment to reflect the change in scope or assumptions and the related price 
depending on the complexity of the amendment  the amendment process can take from a few weeks for a simple adjustment  such as a timeline extension  to several months for a complex amendment  such as a change in patient 
table of contents enrollment strategy 
under the company s policy  project teams are not authorized to engage in tasks outside the scope of the contract without prior management approval 
in some situations  management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while the company and its customer negotiate and finalize the contract amendment 
contract amendments are commonplace within the industry and occur on the majority of the company s contracts 
at any point in time  the company will be in the process of discussing numerous proposed amendments  the scope and value of which can change significantly between time of proposal and final agreement 
the total value of these amendments primarily represents future work and revenues 
in addition to full service and limited service arrangements described above  the company provides consulting services to its customers under contracts that generally are shorter term in nature than full service contracts 
net service revenues from these contracts represent less than of the company s consolidated net service revenues 
in connection with providing services  the company incurs pass through costs  which include travel related expenses for company employees performing services and fees payable to third party investigators or labs participating in  or supporting  the customer s clinical trial 
the customer agrees to reimburse the company on a dollar for dollar basis for the costs incurred by the company in accordance with contractually specified parameters 
the revenues and costs from these pass through and third party costs are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations under the line items titled reimbursable out of pocket revenues and reimbursable out of pocket costs  respectively 
the customer may terminate the contract at any time with little or no advance notice to the company 
customers  in particular  may terminate a contract immediately for concerns related to the efficacy or safety of a particular drug 
upon termination  the customer is required to pay the company for the value of work completed up to termination as well as reimburse the company for its out of pocket costs incurred in accordance with the contract 
early stage segment contracts early stage segment business awards are subject to a competitive bidding process and  upon award  are memorialized in a contract that includes terms and conditions that are substantially similar to the company s contracts with its late stage segment customers 
the early stage segment contract duration is usually substantially less than the late stage segment 
because these business awards require the company to commit beds at its early stage facilities  the company attempts to require the customer to pay a cancellation fee if the customer cancels a project award 
net service revenues from these contracts generally represent less than of the company s consolidated net service revenues

results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net service revenues net service revenues increased to million for from million in the increase includes a increase due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as kendle and crl clinical services have integrated project teams and revenue is recognized on integrated labor hours and costs  it is difficult to precisely determine the amount of and third and fourth quarter revenue that is attributable to the acquisition of crl clinical services 
the company estimates that a significant portion of the growth in net service revenues is due to this acquisition

a primary reason for the shifts in the above referenced revenue metrics was the crl clinical services acquisition  which strengthened the company s role in global clinical trials and assisted in diversifying the customer base 
reimbursable out of pocket revenues expenses reimbursable out of pocket revenues and expenses fluctuate from period to period due primarily to the level of investigator activity in a particular period 
reimbursable out of pocket revenues and expenses increased to million in from million in a significant portion of the increase in reimbursable out of pocket revenues and costs is due to the crl clinical services acquisition

operating expenses direct costs increased by from million in to million in a significant portion of the increase in costs is related to the acquisition of crl clinical services 
the remaining portion of the increase in direct costs is attributable to the increased hiring of billable employees to support the growth in the overall business

in  the company recorded an million impairment charge on a million customer relationship intangible asset that was acquired in the company s acquisition of clinical and pharmacologic research  inc cpr in morgantown  west virginia 
the intangible asset represents one customer relationship which due to its characteristics was considered to have an indefinite life and was subject to annual impairment testing 
the fair value of the intangible at december   was calculated by using a discounted cash flow model 
due to declining net service revenue in from this customer at the morgantown facility as well as budgeted net service revenue for and future projected net service revenues that are at lesser levels than historically experienced from this customer  the company determined that the customer relationship was impaired 
as a result of this impairment charge  the company has assigned a year useful life to the customer relationship and began amortizing this asset in the amortization expense on this asset was approximately  income from operations in increased to million  or of net service revenues  compared to million  or of net service revenues in income from operations from kendle s early stage segment in was million  or of net service revenues compared to early stage loss from operations of million in the early stage loss from operations in was due to the million impairment charge discussed above

in addition to the gains on the foreign currency hedge arrangements  discussed above  the company recorded foreign exchange rate losses of approximately million in compared to losses of approximately million in the increased foreign exchange rate loss is due to the continued weakening of the us dollar against the british pound and the euro as well as an increase in the number of global contracts the company has entered into in  leading to increased exchange rate exposure 
the exchange rate transaction losses typically occur when the company holds assets in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting location 
with the exception of the hedge arrangements on intercompany notes referred to above  the company does not currently have hedges in place to mitigate exposure due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
due to uncertainties regarding the timing of and currencies involved in the majority of the company s foreign exchange rate transactions it is impracticable to implement hedging instruments to match the company s foreign currency inflows and outflows 
the company will continue to evaluate ways to mitigate the risk of this impact in the future

for a discussion of the effects of the convertible notes and the bond hedges and warrants discussed below on earnings per share  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
concurrent with the sale of the convertible notes  the company purchased convertible bond hedges from the underwriter and jp morgan chase collectively  the counterparties  which are designed to mitigate potential dilution from the conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of the company s common stock at the time of exercise is greater than approximately

for income tax reporting purposes  the company has elected to integrate the convertible notes and the bond hedges 
integration of the bond hedges with the convertible notes creates an original issue discount oid debt instrument for income tax reporting purposes 
therefore  the cost of the bond hedges will be accounted for as interest expense over the term of the convertible notes for income tax reporting purposes 
the associated income tax benefits that are recognized for financial reporting purposes will be recognized as a reduction in the income tax provision in the periods that the deductions are taken for income tax reporting purposes 
the company received net proceeds from the sale of the convertible notes of approximately million after deducting the underwriter s discounts and commissions 
in addition  the company used approximately million of the net proceeds of the offering to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions 
the company made a mandatory prepayment of million of the net proceeds of the offering toward repayment of amounts owed under the term loan under its credit agreement and made additional voluntary prepayments during the third quarter of to pay off the remaining balance of the term loan 
as of december   million was outstanding under the convertible notes  no amounts were outstanding under the revolving credit loan and no amounts were outstanding under the multicurrency facility 
the weighted average interest rate in effect on the term loan for the first nine months of was approximately 
the company s primary cash needs on both a short term and long term basis are for the payment of salaries and fringe benefits  hiring and recruiting expenses  business development costs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and facility related expenses 
the company believes that its existing capital resources  together with cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the facility and the multicurrency facility  will be sufficient to meet its foreseeable cash needs 
in the future  the company will continue to consider the acquisition of businesses to enhance its service offerings  therapeutic base and global presence 
any such acquisitions may require additional external financings and the company may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that such financings will be available on terms acceptable to the company

under the terms of the convertible notes  the convertible notes are convertible into shares of the common stock upon the occurrence of various factors described in the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis 
the above table assumes no conversion with the principal amount of the convertible notes paid at the maturity date of july  the interest rate used in the calculation of interest was as outlined in the convertible notes

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported consolidated financial statements for a particular period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the majority of the company s net service revenues are based on fixed price contracts calculated on a proportional performance basis also referred to herein as percentage of completion based upon assumptions regarding the estimated total costs for each contract 
additionally  work is performed under time and materials contracts  recognizing revenue as hours are worked based on the hourly billing rate for each contract 
the company also recognizes revenue under units based contracts by multiplying units completed by the applicable contract per unit price 
finally  at one of the company s early stage operations  the contracts are of a short term nature and revenue is recognized under the completed contract method of accounting 
with respect to fixed price contracts  a percentage of completion is multiplied by the contract value to determine the amount of revenue recognized 
costs are incurred for performance of each contract and compared to the estimated budgeted costs for that contract to determine a percentage of completion on the contract 
the contract value equals the value of the services to be performed under the contract as determined by aggregating the labor hours estimated to be incurred to perform the tasks in the contract at the agreed rates 
contract value excludes the value of third party and other pass through costs 
as the work progresses  original estimates might be changed as a result of management s regular contract review process 

table of contents management regularly reviews the budget on each contract to determine if the budgeted costs accurately reflect the costs that the company will incur for contract performance 
the company reviews each contract s performance to date  current cost trends and circumstances specific to each contract 
the company estimates its remaining costs to complete the contract based on a variety of factors  including actual costs incurred to date and the work completed in incurring the actual costs  the remaining work to be completed based on the timeline of the contract as well as the number of units remaining for certain tasks in the contract  and factors that could change the rate of progress of future contract performance 
examples of factors included in the review process include patient enrollment rate  changes in the composition of staff on the project or other customer requirements  among other things 
based on these contract reviews  the company adjusts its cost estimates 
adjustments to net service revenue resulting from changes in cost estimates are recorded on a cumulative basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
when estimates indicate a loss  such loss is provided in the current period in its entirety 
while the company routinely adjusts cost estimates on individual contracts  the company s estimates and assumptions historically have been accurate in all material respects in the aggregate 
the company expects the estimates and assumptions to remain accurate in all material respects in the aggregate in future periods 
a contract amendment  which results in revisions to net service revenues and cost estimates  is recognized in the percentage of completion calculations beginning in the period in which the parties agree to the amendment 
see also company overview section of md a for a description of the contract amendment process 
historically the aggregate value of contract amendments signed in any year represents to of annual sales  and  like sales  represents future net service revenues 
although the majority of the company s contract amendments relate to future services  the company and its customers may execute contract amendments for services that the company already has performed 
in these circumstances  net service revenue from these services is recognized in the current period 
historically  the impact of such amendments on results of operations has not been material 
under the company s policy  project teams are not authorized to engage in tasks outside the scope of the contract without prior management approval 
in some situations  management may authorize the project team to commence work on activities outside the contract scope while the company and its customer negotiate and finalize the contract amendment 
when work progresses on unsigned  unprocessed contract amendments  the company reviews the direct costs incurred  and  where material defers such costs on the balance sheet 
in addition  the impact of such costs on the estimates to complete is considered and  where material  the estimates are adjusted 
historically  neither the deferred costs nor the impact on estimates have been material 
the company believes that total costs constitute the most appropriate indicator of the performance of fixed price contracts because the costs relate primarily to the amount of labor hours incurred to perform the contract 
the customer receives the benefit of the work performed throughout the contract term and is obligated to pay for services once performed 
accordingly  the company believes that an input measure of cost is a reasonable surrogate for an output measure under the proportional performance model and is consistent with the revenue recognition concepts of staff accounting bulletin sab as the company provides services on projects  it also incurs third party and other pass through costs  which are reimbursable by its customers pursuant to the contract 
the revenues and costs from these third party and other pass through costs are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations under the line items titled reimbursable out of pocket revenues and reimbursable out of pocket costs  respectively 
direct costs direct costs consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for project related associates  unreimbursed project related costs and an allocated portion of indirect costs  which primarily includes facilities related costs and information systems costs 
labor costs represent over of total direct costs with the allocated portion of indirect costs representing less than of total 
to determine the allocated portion of indirect costs  the company calculates an allocation percentage based on the relationship between billable associate salaries and total salaries 
the remaining indirect costs are allocated to sg a 
because the company s business is labor intensive  direct costs historically have increased with an increase in net service revenues 
the company  however  has not experienced any material variations in the relationship between direct costs and net service revenues for the fiscal years ended  and the following factors will cause direct costs to decrease as a percentage of net service revenues higher utilization rates for billable employees  and the ability to complete contracted work more efficiently than estimated by the company 

table of contents the following factors will cause direct costs to increase as a percentage of net service revenues the occurrence of cost overruns from increased time to complete contract performance  increased costs due to higher paid employees or contractors performing contract services  and pricing pressure from increased competition 
the company does not expect that the foregoing factors will have a material impact on the historical relationship between direct costs and net service revenues 
other costs selling  general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related fringe benefits for sales and administrative employees and professional services  as well as unallocated costs related to facilities  information systems and other costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization costs recorded on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of the property or equipment and internally developed software 
finite lived intangible assets are generally amortized on an accelerated basis based on the discounted cash flow calculations used in the valuation of the asset 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been issued to customers 
unbilled accounts receivable are amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been issued to customers 
advance billings represent amounts billed or payment received for which revenues have not yet been earned 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on historical evidence of accounts receivable collections and specific identification of accounts receivable that might pose collection problems 
the bad debt provision is monitored on a regular basis and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
with the exception of a million write off in of receivables due from one customer  the company s allowance for doubtful accounts has been sufficient to cover any bad debt write offs 
if the company is unable to collect all or part of its outstanding receivables  there could be a material impact to the company s consolidated statements of operations or financial position 
long lived assets the company analyzes goodwill and other finite lived intangible assets to determine any potential impairment loss on an annual basis  unless conditions exist that require an updated analysis on an interim basis 
certain factors that may occur and indicate an impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the underlying assets  and significant adverse industry or market economic trends 
a fair value approach is used to test goodwill for impairment 
the fair value approach compares estimates related to the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
at december  and  the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value  resulting in no goodwill impairment charge 
in addition  the company has an intangible asset representing one customer relationship acquired in the company s acquisition of cpr 
the fair value of this customer relationship had been million prior to the fourth quarter of and the useful life had been designated as indefinite 
due to declining net service revenue from this customer in and declining net service revenue projected for and future years  the company determined that the asset was impaired and recorded an million impairment charge in effective january   the company assigned a year useful life to the customer relationship and in the first quarter of the company began amortizing the customer relationship basis over the years on a straight line basis 
the estimate of fair value of long lived assets is inherently subjective and requires the company to make a number of assumptions and projections 
these assumptions and projections relate to future net service revenue  earnings and the probability of certain outcomes and scenarios 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in estimating fair value of its long lived assets  the estimated fair value of these assets could change and result in impairment charges 
internally developed software pursuant to the guidance included in statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  the company capitalizes costs incurred to internally develop software used primarily in the company s proprietary clinical trial and data management systems  and amortizes these costs over the useful life of the product  not to exceed five years 
internally developed software represents software in the application development stage  and there is no assurance that the software development process will produce a final product for which the fair value exceeds its carrying value 
internally developed software is an intangible asset subject to impairment write downs whenever events indicate that the carrying value of the software 
table of contents may not be recoverable 
as with other long lived assets  this asset is reviewed at least annually to determine the appropriateness of the carrying value of the asset 
assessing the fair value of the internally developed software requires estimates and judgment on the part of management 
tax valuation allowance and tax liabilities the company adopted fin as of january  fin requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgments as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate  and  consequently  the company s operating results 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
the company determines its liability for uncertain tax positions globally under the provisions in fin at december   the company has recorded a gross fin liability of million 
if events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the calculation of liability related to uncertain tax positions proves to be more or less than the ultimate assessment  a tax expense or benefit to expense  respectively  would result 
the company provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
specifically  the company estimates its tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
because the company conducts business on a global basis  its effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of its pre tax earnings losses among jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
the company has assessed the realization of deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance has been established based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that realization cannot be assured 
the ultimate realization of this tax benefit is dependent upon the generation of sufficient operating income in the respective tax jurisdictions 
if estimates prove inaccurate or if the tax laws change unfavorably  significant revisions in the valuation allowance may be required in the future 
stock based compensation effective january   the company began accounting for stock based incentive programs under sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r superseded accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement at fair value 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas r for all share based payments granted after january   and for all awards granted to employees prior to january   that remain unvested on january  the company adopted sfas r using a modified prospective application 
the company uses the straight line method of recording compensation expense relative to share based payment 
the weighted average fair value of the options granted was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of a black scholes model requires the use of extensive historical employee exercise data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including assumptions regarding expected volatility of the stock  the risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected term of the grant 
the company calculated expected volatility of its stock based on the volatility of its stock over a period approximating the expected term of the grants 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of the company s employee stock options 
the company assumed a dividend yield of zero because the company has not paid dividends in the past and does not expect to do so in the future 
because stock based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
the expected term of the option is based upon the contractual term and expected employee exercise and expected post vesting employment termination behavior 
the adoption of sfas r resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of approximately  and million in and  respectively 
the incremental stock based compensation expense caused net income to decrease by approximately  and basic and diluted earnings per share to decrease by per share in the incremental stock based compensation expense caused net income to decrease by approximately million and basic and diluted earnings per share to decrease by per share in stock based compensation expense is recorded primarily in general and administrative expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations as the majority of the stock option expense related to options granted to executives 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that the company records may differ significantly from the expense recorded in the current period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its amounts outstanding under the facility and multicurrency facility 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under either the facility or the multicurrency facility 
in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement and an interest rate collar arrangement to fix the interest rate on a portion of its debt 
the company fixed the interest rate on the total outstanding balance of the term loan through april  at a fixed rate of plus the margin 
beginning may   the company fixed the interest rate on million of the outstanding term loan at the rate of plus the margin with an additional million covered under the interest rate collar 
the collar provides for interest rate protection at a cap of and a floor of 
these agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
and all changes in the fair market value of the hedge will be recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the company terminated the swap transaction and paid  to reflect the amounts due upon termination of the swap 
total losses related to changes in the fair market value of the interest rate swap and collar arrangements  including the  paid out upon termination of the swap arrangement were approximately million 
a change in interest rates would change the amount recorded related to the fair market value of the interest rate collar arrangement by approximately million in foreign currency the company operates on a global basis and is therefore exposed to various types of currency risks 
two specific transaction risks arise from the nature of the contracts the company executes with its customers 
from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular local currency 
this contract currency denomination issue is applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by the company 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net service revenues and resultant net income or loss can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  the company recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing at the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared until the payment from the customer is received will result in the company receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by the company as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents a third type of transaction risk arises from transactions denominated in multiple currencies between any two of the company s various subsidiary locations 
for each subsidiary  the company maintains an intercompany receivable and payable  which is denominated in multiple currencies 
changes in exchange rates from the time the intercompany receivable payable balance arises until the balance is settled or measured for reporting purposes  results in exchange rate gains and losses 
this intercompany receivable payable arises when work is performed by a kendle location in one country on behalf of a kendle location in a different country under contract with the customer 
additionally  there are occasions when funds are transferred between subsidiaries for working capital purposes 
the foreign currency transaction gain or loss is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  the company recorded total foreign exchange losses of approximately million compared to million in related to the risks described above 
as described below  in the first quarter of the company entered into foreign currency hedge transactions to hedge exposure related to intercompany notes between the company s us subsidiary  as lender  and the company s subsidiaries in each of the united kingdom and germany 
the company s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from local currency into us dollars as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
foreign currency translation adjustments  which are reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  were approximately million at december  and million at december  foreign currency hedges in the first quarter of  the company entered into foreign currency hedging transactions to mitigate exposure in movements between the u 
s dollar and british pounds sterling and u 
s dollar and euro 
the hedging transactions are designed to mitigate the company s exposure related to two intercompany notes between the company s us subsidiary  as lender  and the company s subsidiaries in each of the united kingdom and germany 
the note between the company s us subsidiary and united kingdom subsidiary is denominated in pounds sterling and had an outstanding principal amount of approximately million at december  the note between the company s us subsidiary and german subsidiary is denominated in euro and had an outstanding principal amount of approximately million at december  the hedge agreements were not designated for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
and all changes in the fair market value of the hedge are recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
in  the company recorded losses of approximately million on the euro hedge transaction and gains of approximately  on the pound sterling transaction related to the changes in the fair market value of the hedge 
the losses on the fair market value of the hedge were offset by foreign exchange gains of approximately million on the change in value of the euro intercompany note and approximately  on the change in value of the pound sterling intercompany note 
as it relates specifically to the foreign currency hedges discussed above  a change in the us dollar to euro and us dollar to pound sterling exchange rates would impact pre tax income by approximately  in fair value of derivative transactions the notional amounts and fair values of the company s interest rate collar and foreign currency hedges at december  are shown below in thousands
