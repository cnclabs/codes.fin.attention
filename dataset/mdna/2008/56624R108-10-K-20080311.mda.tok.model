we have no barter transactions 
we recognize revenue upon the completion of our performance obligation  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties 
collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owing that occurs subsequent to period ends 
performance based advertising services in providing pay per click and pay per phone call advertising services  we generate revenue upon our delivery of qualified and reported click throughs or phone calls to our advertisers or advertising service providers listings 
these advertisers and advertising service providers pay us a designated transaction fee for each click through or phone call  which occurs when an online user clicks on or makes a phone call based on any of their advertisement listings after it has been placed by us or by our distribution partners 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction 
the advertisement listings are displayed within our distribution network  which includes search engines  directories  destination sites  third party internet domains or web sites  our portfolio of owned web sites and other targeted web based content 
we also generate revenue from cost per action services  which occurs when the online user is redirected from one of our web sites or a third party web site in our distribution network to a advertiser web site and completes the specified action  such as when a call is placed 
in providing pay per click contextual based advertising  advertisers purchase keywords or keyword strings  based on an amount they choose for a targeted placement on vertically focused web sites or specific pages of a web site that are specific to their products or services and their marketing objectives 
the contextual results distributed by our services are prioritized for users by the amount the advertiser is willing to pay each time a user clicks on the merchant s advertisement and the relevance of the merchant s advertisement  which is dictated by historical click through rates 
advertisers pay us when a click through occurs on their advertisement 
in providing feed management services  advertisers pay for their web pages and product databases to be crawled  or searched  and included in search engine  directory and product shopping engine results within our distribution network 
generally  the feed management listings are presented in a different section of the web 
table of contents page than the pay per click listings 
for this service  revenue is generated when an online user clicks on a feed management listing from search engine  directory or product shopping engine results 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction for which the advertiser pays for on a per click basis 
the placement of a feed management result is largely determined by its relevancy  as determined by the distribution partner 
search marketing services advertisers pay us additional fees for services such as bid management and natural search engine optimization 
advertisers generally pay us on a click through basis  although in certain cases we receive a fixed fee for delivery of these services 
in some cases we also deliver banner campaigns for select advertisers 
we may also charge initial set up  account  service or inclusion fees as part of our services 
banner advertising revenue may be based on a fixed fee per click and is generated and recognized on click through activity 
in other cases  banner payment terms are volume based with revenue generated and recognized when impressions are delivered 
non refundable account set up fees are paid by advertisers and are recognized ratably over the longer of the term of the contract or the average expected advertiser relationship period  which generally ranges from twelve months to more than two years 
other account and service fees are recognized in the month or period the account fee or services relate to 
other inclusion fees are generally associated with monthly or annual subscription based services where a advertiser pays a fixed amount to be included in our index of listings or our distribution partners index of listings 
revenues from these subscription arrangements are recognized ratably over the service period 
outsourced search marketing platforms we generate revenue from super aggregator partners and publishers utilizing our web based technologies 
we are paid a management or agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made by the advertiser 
the partners or publishers engage the advertisers and are the primary obligor  and we  in certain instances  are only financially liable to the publishers in our capacity as a collection agency for the amount collected from the advertisers 
we recognize revenue for these fees under the net revenue recognition method 
industry and market factors we enter into agreements with various distribution partners to provide distribution for the url strings and advertisement listings of our advertisers 
we generally pay distribution partners based on a percentage of revenue or a fixed amount per click through on these listings 
the level of click throughs contributed by our distribution partners has varied  and we expect it will continue to vary  from quarter to quarter and year to year  sometimes significantly 
if we do not add new distribution partners  renew our current distribution partner agreements or replace traffic lost from terminated distribution agreements with other sources or if our distribution partners search businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
our current growth will be impacted by our ability to increase our distribution  which impacts the number of internet users who have access to our advertisers listings and the rate at which our advertisers are able to convert clicks from these internet users into completed transactions  such as a purchase or sign up 
our current growth also depends on our ability to continue to increase the number of advertisers who use our services and the amount these advertisers spend on our services 
we anticipate that these variables will fluctuate in the future  affecting our growth rate and our financial results 
in particular  it is difficult to project the number of click throughs we will deliver to our advertisers and how much advertisers will spend with us  and it is even more difficult to anticipate the average revenue per click through 

table of contents in addition  we believe we will experience seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonal fluctuations in levels of internet usage and seasonal purchasing cycles of many advertisers 
it is generally understood that during the spring and summer months  internet usage is lower than during other times of the year  especially in comparison to the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
the extent to which usage may decrease during these off peak periods is difficult to predict 
prolonged or severe decreases in usage during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results 
service costs our service costs represent the cost of providing our performance based advertising services and our search marketing services 
the service costs that we have incurred in the periods presented primarily include user acquisition costs  amortization and impairment of intangible assets  license and content fees  credit card processing fees  network operations  serving our search results  telecommunication costs  including provisioning of telephone numbers  maintaining our web sites  domain name registration renewal fees  network fees  fees paid to outside service providers  delivering customer service  depreciation of our web sites  network equipment and internally developed software  colocation service charges of our web site equipment  bandwidth and software license fees  payroll and related expenses of related personnel  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
user acquisition costs for the periods presented the largest component of our service costs consist of user acquisition costs that relate primarily to payments made to distribution partners for access to their online user traffic 
we enter into agreements of varying durations with distribution partners that integrate our services into their web sites and indexes 
the primary economic structure of the distribution partner agreements is a variable payment based on a specified percentage of revenue 
these variable payments are often subject to minimum payment amounts per click through 
other payment structures that to a lesser degree exist include fixed payments  based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered  variable payments based on a specified metric  such as number of paid click throughs  and a combination arrangement with both fixed and variable amounts that may be paid in advance 

table of contents we expense user acquisition costs based on whether the agreement provides for fixed or variable payments 
agreements with fixed payments are generally expensed as the greater of pro rata over the term the fixed payment covers  or usage delivered to date divided by the guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered 
agreements with variable payments based on a percentage of revenue  number of paid click throughs or other metrics are expensed as incurred based on the volume of the underlying activity or revenue multiplied by the agreed upon price or rate 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales functions  advertising and promotional expenditures including online and outside marketing activities  cost of systems used to sell to and serve advertisers  and stock based compensation of related personnel

our research and development expenses include payroll and related expenses for personnel  costs of computer hardware and software  costs incurred in developing features and functionality of the services we offer  and stock based compensation of related personnel 
for the periods presented  substantially all of our product development expenses are research and development 
product development costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement requires that costs incurred in the preliminary project and post implementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses for executive and administrative personnel  professional services  including accounting  legal and insurance  bad debt provisions  facilities costs  other general corporate expenses  and stock based compensation of related personnel 

table of contents stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and used the intrinsic value method 
in accordance with apb  stock based compensation consisted of the following the intrinsic value of employee option and restricted stock issuances in cases where the fair value of the underlying stock was greater than the exercise price on the date of the grant  the fair value of non employee option issuances  and the amount by which the fair value of our class b common stock exceeds the exercise price at the end of the period for certain options 
as of january   we adopted financial accounting standards board s fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment sfas r and account for stock based compensation under the fair value method 
as a result  stock based compensation consists of the following all share based compensation arrangements granted after january  and for any such arrangements that are modified  cancelled  or repurchased after that date  and the portion of previous share based awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered as of that date  based on the grant date estimated fair value of those awards estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas as we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  the results for the prior year have not been restated under the fair value method for gaap purposes 
stock based compensation expense has been included in the same lines as compensation paid to the same employees in the consolidated statement of operations in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the prior period has been reclassified to conform to the presentation in the current period 
amortization of intangibles from acquisitions amortization of intangible assets excluding goodwill relates to intangible assets identified in connection with our acquisitions 
the intangible assets have been identified as non competition agreements  trade and internet domain names  distributor relationships  advertising customer base relationships  patents  and acquired technology 
these assets are amortized over useful lives ranging from to months 
provision for income taxes for income tax purposes  we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective 
table of contents tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not  based on its operating performance and projections of future taxable income  that our net deferred tax assets  excluding certain state net operating loss carryforwards  will be realized 
in determining that it was more likely than not that we would realize the deferred tax assets  factors considered included historical taxable income  historical trends related to advertiser usage rates and projected revenues and expenses 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in increases to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and a corresponding increase to income tax expense of up to the entire net amount of deferred tax assets 
from time to time  various state  federal  and other jurisdictional tax authorities undertake reviews of us and our filings 
we believe any adjustments that may ultimately be required as a result of any of these reviews will not be material to the financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fin no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this pronouncement prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the our tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin was effective for us beginning january  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
as of december  and  we had federal net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards of million for both periods which will begin to expire in the tax reform act of limits the use of nol and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of a company 
we believe that such a change has occurred  and that the utilization of the approximately million of nol carryforwards is limited such that substantially all of these federal nol carryforwards will never be utilized 
as of december  and  we had certain tax effected state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not have a history of taxable income in the relevant state and the state net operating loss carryforwards will more likely than not expire unutilized 
therefore  we have recorded a valuation allowance on the state net operating loss carryforwards as of december  and follow on public offering in february  we closed a follow on public offering of  shares of class b common stock at a public offering price of per share and  shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock at a public offering price of per share and with a liquidation preference of per share 
these amounts include the exercise by our underwriters of their over allotment option to purchase  additional shares of class b common stock and  additional shares of preferred stock 
the common stock and preferred stock proceeds  net of total offering costs of million  were approximately million and million  respectively  for an aggregate amount of million 
all of the net proceeds have been used to fund the name development and pike street industries asset acquisitions  and the industrybrains acquisition in  the areaconnect and open list asset acquisitions in may  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes

our partner network revenues are primarily generated using third party distribution networks to deliver the advertisers listings 
the distribution network includes search engines  shopping engines  directories  destination sites  third party internet domains or web sites  and other targeted web based content 
we generate revenue upon delivery of qualified and reported click throughs to our advertisers or to advertising services providers listings 
we pay a revenue share to the distribution partners to access their online user traffic 
other revenues include our call provisioning and call tracking services  bid management services  natural search optimization services and outsourced search marketing platforms 
revenue increased  from million in to million in the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of accounts on our platform and related revenues we generated from super aggregator partners and more distribution partners adopting our third party content platform which correspondingly increased revenue generated clicks 
the majority of the increase in revenues from our proprietary traffic is attributable to more click throughs on advertiser s listings on our portfolio of more than  web sites 
we believe the increase in revenue is primarily a result of the growth of our existing distribution partners and proprietary traffic sources  the increased number of searches and resulting click throughs performed by users of our services  and new advertisers and advertising services provider relationships 
we also believe the foregoing factors  combined with our sales efforts have contributed to an increase in the average revenue per advertiser 
the increase in revenue is partially attributable to the acquisition of voicestar in september revenue increased  from million in to million in this increase was attributable to a million increase in performance based advertising services 
of this increase  a substantial majority related to an increase in the average revenue per advertiser  while the remaining related to an increase in the number of advertisers 
of the total revenue increase  million is derived from our proprietary traffic revenues which are attributable to our portfolio of more than  web sites 
the majority of the revenues from our proprietary traffic are attributable to the name development and pike street asset acquisitions in the increase in revenue in is also partially attributable to the acquisition of industrybrains in july which added more than unique distribution partners and more than  unique advertisers and the may areaconnect asset acquisition 
our ability to maintain and grow our revenues will depend in part on maintaining and increasing the number of click throughs and calls performed by users of our services through our distribution partners and proprietary traffic sources and maintaining and increasing the number and volume of transactions and favorable payment 
table of contents terms with advertisers and advertising service providers  which we believe is dependent in part on marketing our web sites and delivering high quality traffic that ultimately results in purchases or conversions for our advertisers and advertising services providers 
we may increase our direct monetization of our proprietary traffic sources which may not be at the same rate levels as other advertising providers and could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
if we do not add new distribution partners  renew our current distribution partner agreements or replace traffic lost from terminated distribution agreements with other sources or if our distribution partners search businesses do not grow or are adversely affected  our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
as revenue grows and the volume of transactions and traffic increases  we will need to expand our network infrastructure 
inefficiencies in our network infrastructure to scale and adapt to higher traffic volumes could materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the company anticipates that these variables will fluctuate in the future  affecting our growth rate and our financial results 
in particular  it is difficult to project the number of click throughs we will deliver to our advertisers and how much advertisers will spend with us  and it is even more difficult to anticipate the average revenue per click through 
in addition  we believe we will experience seasonality 
our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to seasonal fluctuations in levels of internet usage and seasonal purchasing cycles of many advertisers 
it is generally understood that during the spring and summer months  internet usage is lower than during other times of the year  especially in comparison to the fourth quarter of the calendar year 
the extent to which usage may decrease during these off peak periods is difficult to predict 
prolonged or severe decreases in usage during these periods may adversely affect our growth rate and results

the decrease as a percentage of revenue in service costs as compared to was primarily a result of a larger proportion of revenue attributable to our proprietary traffic sources for which there are no corresponding distribution partner payments 
payments to feed management and pay per click distribution partners account for higher user acquisition costs as a percentage of revenue relative to our overall service cost percentage 
we expect that user acquisition costs and revenue shares to distribution partners are likely to increase prospectively given the competitive landscape for distribution partners 
to the extent that payments to feed management and pay per click distribution partners make up a larger percentage of future operations  or the addition or renewal of existing distribution partner agreements are on terms less favorable to us  we expect that service costs will increase as a percentage of revenue

with respect to a significant portion of our pay per click advertising services  we have no corresponding payments to distribution partners related to our proprietary revenues or we receive payment from advertisers prior to our delivery of related click throughs with the corresponding payments to the distribution partners who provide placement for the listings generally made only after our delivery of a click through 
in most cases  the amount payable to the distribution partner will be calculated at the end of a calendar month  with a payment period following the delivery of the click throughs 
this payment structure results in a lag period between the 
table of contents earlier receipt of the cash from the advertisers and the later payment to the distribution partners 
these services constituted the majority of revenue in  and in certain cases  payments to distribution partners are paid in advance or are fixed in advance based on a guaranteed minimum amount of usage delivered 
nearly all of the feed management services and advertising services provider arrangements are billed on a monthly basis following the month of our click through delivery 
this payment structure results in our advancement of monies to the distribution partners who have provided the corresponding placements of the listings 
for these services  advertiser s payments are generally received one to three weeks following payment to the distribution partners 
we expect that in the future periods  if the feed management services account for a greater percentage of our operating activity  working capital requirements will increase as a result

as a result of our acquisitions  we increased our property and equipment purchases for items such as network equipment and software  furniture  software and equipment for our personnel  and systems used to sell to and serve advertisers 
as our operations increase  we expect property and equipment purchases will increase as we continue to invest in equipment and software for our systems and personnel 
additionally  we have expended amounts for product development initiatives as well as amounts recorded as part of property and equipment for internally developed software 
we expect our expenditures for product development initiatives and internally developed software will increase in absolute dollars as our development activities accelerate and we increase the number of personnel and consultants to enhance our service offerings 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  of approximately million was primarily attributable to the repurchase of  shares of class b common stock for treasury stock and  shares of preferred stock totaling approximately million and  respectively  and common stock and preferred dividend payments of million  partially offset by net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of stock through employee stock options  employee stock purchases and the issuance of restricted stock to employees and million of excess tax benefit related to stock options

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
total less than year years years contractual obligations operating leases capital leases other contractual obligations total contractual obligations  in february we entered into i a new master agreement with an advertising partner with respect to our advertising business  and ii a license agreement with the same partner with respect to certain of the partner s patents  including but not limited to us patent no 
 pursuant to which we paid million and an additional  in certain circumstances  in an upfront payment and a contingent royalty based on a discounted rate of under certain circumstances of certain of our gross revenues payable on a quarterly basis through december the upfront license fee has been capitalized and is being amortized ratably over months 
the royalty payment is recognized as incurred in service costs 
the royalty payments are not included in the above schedule 
in august  we entered into a new master agreement which expires june and terminates and supersedes the february master agreement  except for the royalty provisions which are still in effect 
under the terms of the preferred stock offering in february  we have a quarterly dividend payment obligation 
dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly on the th day of february  may  august and november  commencing may  at an annual rate of per preferred share 
any dividends must be declared by our board of directors and must come from funds which are legally available for dividend payments 
during and  we paid approximately million and million  respectively  for the purchase of additional internet domains or web sites 
we expect to continue acquiring internet domains or web sites in the normal course of business as we grow our proprietary network of web sites 
we anticipate that we will need to invest working capital towards the development and expansion of our overall operations 
we may also make a significant number of acquisitions  which could result in the reduction of our cash balances or the incurrence of debt 
we have allocated a portion of net proceeds from our offerings to fund acquisitions 
furthermore  we expect that capital expenditures may increase in future periods  particularly if our operating activity increases 
we will have an annual dividend payment obligation under the terms of the preferred stock of  based upon approximately  convertible preferred shares outstanding as of march  dividends are cumulative and payable quarterly on the th day of february  may  august and november  commencing may  at an annual rate of per preferred share 
under delaware law  dividends to stockholders may be made only from the surplus of a company  or  in certain situations  from the net profits for the current fiscal year before the dividend is declared by the board of directors 
if we were to exchange the preferred stock for debentures  we would assume the principal and interest payment obligations under the terms of the debentures 
our ability to pay dividends under the preferred stock or to make payments of principal and interest under the debentures in the future will depend on our financial results  liquidity and financial condition 
in november  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to million shares of our class b common stock as well as the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend for the holders of the class a common stock and class b common stock 
in february  our board of directors authorized 
table of contents an increase in the share repurchase program to provide for the repurchase up to million shares in the aggregate less shares previously repurchased under the share repurchase program of our class b common stock 
under the revised share repurchase program  repurchases may take place in the open market and in privately negotiated transactions and at times and in such amounts as we deem appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  capital availability  and other market conditions 
this share repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be limited or terminated at any time without prior notice 
during the year ended december   approximately million shares of class b common stock were repurchased under the share repurchase program 
in  we have repurchased approximately million of class b common stock to date 
the quarterly cash dividend was initiated at per share of class a common stock and class b common stock 
quarterly dividends were paid on february   may   august  and november  to class a and class b common stockholders of record as of the close of business on february   may   august  and november   respectively 
total dividends paid in were approximately million 
although we expect that the annual cash dividend  subject to capital availability  will be per common share or approximately million for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends at such a rate or at all

based on our operating plans we believe that existing resources and cash flow provided by ongoing operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twelve months 
additional equity and debt financing may be needed to support our acquisition strategy  our long term obligations and our company s needs 
if additional financing is necessary  it may not be available  and if it is available  it may not be possible for us to obtain financing on satisfactory terms 
failure to generate sufficient revenue or raise additional capital could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern and to achieve our intended business objectives 
critical accounting policies the policies below are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of our results 

table of contents our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies relate to the following matters and are described below revenue  goodwill and intangible assets  stock based compensation  and allowance for doubtful accounts  advertiser and incentive program credits 
revenue we currently generate revenue through our operating businesses by delivering performance based and search marketing services to advertisers and advertising service providers 
the primary revenue driver has been performance based advertising  which includes pay per click listings  pay per phone call  cost per action services and feed management services 
for pay per click listing  pay per phone calls and feed management services  revenue is recognized upon our delivery of qualified and reported click throughs or phone calls to our advertisers or advertising service providers listing which occurs when an online user clicks on or makes a phone call based on any of their advertisements after it has been placed by us or by our distribution partners 
each click through on an advertisement listing represents a completed transaction 
for cost per action services  revenue is recognized when the online user is redirected from one of our web sites or a third party web site in our distribution network to an advertiser web site and completes the specified action  such as when a call is placed 
in certain cases  we record revenue based on available and reported preliminary information from third parties 
collection on the related receivables may vary from reported information based upon third party refinement of the estimated and reported amounts owing that occurs subsequent to period ends 
we have entered into agreements with various distribution partners in order to expand our distribution network  which includes search engines  directories  product shopping engines  certain third party web sites and our portfolio of owned web sites  on which we include our advertisers listings 
we generally pay distribution partners based on a specified percentage of revenue or a fixed amount per click through on these listings 
we act as the primary obligor in these transactions  and we are responsible for providing customer and administrative services to the advertiser 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the revenue derived from advertisers who receive paid introductions through us as supplied by distribution partners is reported gross based upon the amounts received from the advertiser 
we also recognize revenue for certain agency contracts with advertisers under the net revenue recognition method 
under these specific agreements  we purchase listings on behalf of advertisers from search engines and directories 
we are paid an agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made on behalf of these advertisers 
under these agreements  our advertisers are primarily responsible for choosing the publisher and determining pricing  and the company  in certain instances  is only financially liable to the publisher for the amount collected from our advertisers 
this creates a sequential liability for media purchases made on behalf of advertisers 
in certain instances  the web publishers engage the advertisers directly and we are paid an agency fee based on the total amount of the purchase made by the advertiser

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations accounted for under the purchase method 
we apply the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s fasb statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas sfas also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived asset sfas 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
to date  no impairment charge has been taken for the goodwill related to our acquisitions 
if the fair value is lower than the carrying value  a material impairment charge may be reported in our financial results 
we exercise judgment in the assessment of the related useful lives of intangible assets  the fair values and the recoverability 
in certain instances  the fair value is determined in part based on cash flow forecasts and discount rate estimates 
we review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if such asset group is considered to be impaired  the impairment is to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value 
assets to be disposed of are separately presented on the balance sheet and reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
no impairment of significance of our intangible assets has been indicated to date 
to the extent such evaluation indicates that the useful lives of intangible assets are different than originally estimated  the amortization period is reduced or extended and  accordingly  the quarterly amortization expense is increased or decreased 
as a result of the significance of the goodwill and intangible asset carrying values  any impairment charges or changes to the estimated amortization periods could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation for all stock based awards made to employees and directors including stock options and restricted stock issuances based on estimated fair values 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and therefore only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the service period of the award 
prior to sfas r  we accounted for share based payments under apb and accordingly  generally recognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and stock options with intrinsic value and accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
under fas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for stock based awards 
our determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected life of the award  our expected 
table of contents stock price  volatility over the term of the award and actual and projected exercise behaviors 
although the fair value of stock based awards is determined in accordance with fas r  the assumptions used in calculating fair value of stock based awards and the black scholes option pricing model are highly subjective  and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock based awards that are granted  exercised and cancelled 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period

allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser and incentive program credits accounts receivable balances are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts and advertiser credits 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our accounts receivable 
we determine our allowance based on analysis of historical bad debts  advertiser concentrations  advertiser creditworthiness and current economic trends 
we review the allowance for collectibility on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and the potential recovery is considered remote 
if the financial condition of our advertisers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimated the allowances required  additional allowances may be required which would result in increased general and administrative expenses in the period such determination was made 
we determine our allowance for advertiser credits and adjustments based upon our analysis of historical credits 
under the advertiser incentive program  we grant advertisers credits depending upon the individual amounts of prepayments made 
the incentive program allowance is determined based on the historical rate of incentives earned and used by advertisers compared to the related revenues recognized by us 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments and estimates

 which delays the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term  money market funds 
we place our investments with high quality financial institutions and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
during the years ended december  and december   the effects of changes in interest rates on the fair market value of our investments and our earnings were not material 
further  we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our investments and our earnings from a hypothetical change in interest rates would not be significant 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments
