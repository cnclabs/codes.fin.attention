item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction and outlook our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of exploration and development activity maintained by oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in the gulf of mexico  and to a lesser extent  foreign locations throughout the world  ii the company s ability to win contracts through competitive bidding or alliance partnering arrangements  and iii the company s ability to manage those contracts to successful completion 
the level of exploration and development activity is related to several factors  including trends of oil and natural gas prices  exploration and production companies expectations of future oil and natural gas prices  and changes in technology that reduce costs and improve expected returns on investment 
backlog as of december   we had a revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of approximately million man hours remaining to work  which consists of work remaining at december  and commitments received through february   compared to the revenue backlog of million and a labor backlog of million man hours reported in our form k at december  of the backlog at december   million  or  represented projects destined for deepwater locations compared to million  or  of projects destined for deepwater locations included in the december  backlog 
the acquisition of gulf marine enabled us to more fully participate in the market for deepwater projects  which we believe will continue to expand as a proportion of total offshore projects 
these deepwater projects directly contributed to the much larger backlog at december  of the backlog at december   we expect to recognize revenues of approximately million during calendar year and million during calendar year  and the remaining million thereafter 
during  our workforce ranged from approximately  to  demand for our products and services dictates our workforce needs 
although we generally try to minimize the use of contract labor  we will use contract labor when required to meet customer demand 
for  our use of contract labor ranged from approximately to critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on the ratio of direct labor hours actually performed to date compared to the total estimated direct labor hours required for completion 
accordingly  contract price and cost estimates are reviewed monthly as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in revenue for the period when such estimates are revised 
if these adjustments were to result in a reduction of previously reported profits  the company would have to recognize a charge against current earnings  which may be significant depending on the size of the project or the adjustment 
profit incentives from customers are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
claims for extra work or changes in scope of work are included in revenue when the amount can be reliably estimated and collection is probable 
at december   the company recorded revenue totaling million related to certain change orders  which have been approved as to scope but not price 
the company is in the process of negotiating resolution of these change orders with the customers and recovery of the revenue is dependent upon these negotiations 
if the company collects amounts different than the 
table of contents million of revenue that has been recorded  that difference will be recognized as income or loss 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
some contracts include a total or partial reimbursement to us of any costs associated with specific capital projects required by the fabrication process 
if this capital project provides future benefits to us  the cost to build the capital project will be capitalized  and the revenue for the capital project will increase the estimated profit in the contract

results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and for the twelve month period ended december   our revenue was million  an increase of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the majority of the increase in revenue was associated with the acquisition of gulf marine  which enabled us to more fully participate in the market for deepwater projects 
we started the year with a backlog of million  of which three major contracts were being fabricated at our gulf marine facility in south texas 
in addition  two of these three major contracts required large material cost outlay during these material costs passed directly to revenue 
for the twelve month period ended december   direct labor man hours were million compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  for the twelve month period ended december   gross profit was million of revenue compared to gross profit of million of revenue for the twelve months ended december  although gross profit increased for compared to the same period in  the gross profit margins in decreased 
this decrease in gross profit margin was caused by a substantially greater amount of pass through costs  with no associated profit  included in the revenue and costs for the twelve months of compared to the same period of and was also caused by increased labor costs primarily due to our reliance on contract labor to maintain sufficient labor levels to complete the major projects in progress 
during  our weighted average number of contract employees was employees compared to contract employees for  an increase of 
material and subcontract costs represented of the direct cost of sales for the twelve months ended december   compared to for the twelve months ended december  although we have 
table of contents normal escalation clauses in the larger contracts for material and labor  the dramatic increases post hurricanes katrina and rita in labor rates with the simultaneous increased demand for labor in the upstream and downstream sectors of the fabrication business  has caused an abnormal increase in labor rates for skilled labor 
we continue to negotiate with our customers in an attempt to neutralize additional increases in labor  material and subcontract costs  but we can not ensure that any of these additional costs will be reimbursed 
the company s general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  this compares to million for the twelve month period ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to  from of revenue  for the twelve month periods ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses are directly related to increases in the number of personnel and related cost salaries  wages and benefit related costs normally associated with increases in production volumes 
the company had net interest income of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest expense of  for the twelve month period ended december  the change is primarily the result of borrowings incurred by the company related to the acquisition of  and additional capital expenditures for  gulf marine 
in the other section of the other income expense category for is a net expense of  related to the sale of miscellaneous equipment 
in the other section of the other income expense category for is a net income of million 
the majority of this income was the result of the sale of the company s interest in mindoc  which was effective january   and which generated a gain of approximately million 
the remainder was from the gain on the sale of other fixed assets 
the company s effective income tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to for the twelve month period ended december  the increases relate primarily to the employment hiring credits available to us in for both state and federal taxes that phased out in the third and fourth quarters of comparison of the years ended december  and the company s revenue for the twelve month period ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to million in revenue for the twelve month period ended december  the majority of the increase in revenue was associated with the acquisition of gulf marine  which enabled the company to more fully participate in the market for deepwater projects

s 
gulf coast imparting extensive damage to the offshore platforms and the infrastructure along the gulf coast 
this damage negatively impacted the gulf coast fabrication industry  including our company  for the third and fourth quarters of the pressure placed on the existing skilled labor by the rebuilding of the gulf coast after hurricanes katrina and rita  the upgrading of the petro chemical plants in the area  and the high demand for skilled labor throughout the marine construction industry caused the company to incur increased labor costs and to rely more heavily on contract labor  not only during  but throughout the increased employee and contract labor costs  particularly on two large contracts in our backlog that were bid before hurricanes katrina and rita  was the major cause of the reduction in gross profit margin to of revenue for  from of revenue for the company also experienced an increase in raw material costs 
in addition  during the first quarter of  the company acquired the gulf marine facilities 
the acquisition of gulf marine helped the company to produce total revenue of million and man hours worked of million  for the twelve months ended december  this 
table of contents compares to million of revenue and million man hours worked during the twelve months ended december  this increase in revenue for when compared to  although at a reduced gross profit margin  enabled the company to increase gross profit by million  or a increase over gross profit 
the company s general and administrative expenses were million for the twelve month period ended december  this compares to million for the twelve month period ended december  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to  from of revenue  for the twelve month periods ended december  and december   respectively 
exclusive of gulf marine  general and administrative expenses were million  of revenue  for the twelve month period ended december  exclusive of gulf marine  the absolute dollar increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to increases in salaries and wage related cost associated with the increase in production activities 
the company had net interest expense of  for the twelve month period ended december   compared to net interest income of million for the twelve month period ended december  the change is primarily the result of borrowings incurred by the company related to the acquisition of  and additional capital expenditures for  gulf marine during in the other section of the other income expense category for is a net income of million 
the majority of this income was the result of the sale of the company s interest in mindoc  which was effective january   and which generated a gain of approximately million 
the remainder was from the gain on the sale of other fixed assets 
for  the other section was a net expense of  the majority of this expense  reflects the market loss we recorded as a result of the liquidation of short term investments in january in anticipation of the acquisition of gulf marine s assets 
fasb required that we record the loss in the company s effective income tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december   compared to of income before income taxes for the twelve month period ended december  the decrease relates primarily to the change in the apportionment of taxable state income and employment hiring credits for both state and federal taxes 
liquidity and capital resources historically we have funded our business activities through funds generated from operations 
at december   the company s cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to at december  working capital was million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december  the company s primary source of cash is its cash receipts related to contract receivables 
in the early phases of a new project  the company utilizes its cash to purchase material and outside services and increase labor activities  which results in a reduction of cash and an increase in contract receivables 
in certain contracts  the process to measure the amount of invoicing for a particular customer may differ from the process to measure revenue recognition on the contract  thus an increase in contracts receivable can be offset by an increase in billing in excess of cost 
when comparing december  to december   contracts receivable increased by million million from  but billings in excess of cost and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts increased by million million from million 
thus  creating a million reduction is cash provided by operating activities 
of the million of contracts receivable outstanding at december   approximately million had been collected through february  the million of net cash used in financing activities for the period ended december  was made up of million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and  of tax benefit from the exercise of stock options less million in payments of dividends on common stock 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  of which the entire amount was for 
table of contents capital expenditures for improvements to our production facilities and for equipment designed to increase the capacity of our facilities and the productivity of our labor force 
included in capital expenditures for was million for the construction of a graving dock and million for the purchase of six  rubber tired  hydraulic modular transporters kamag type for our gulf marine facility 
total completed cost of the graving dock is estimated to be million and it is expected to be the only graving dock of this size on the gulf coast 
the transporters will allow various deck sections weighing up to  tons to be transported around the facility much easier than more conventional tracking of sections with cranes 
effective february   we entered into the sixth amendment to the ninth amended and restated credit agreement the revolver to extend the term of the million revolver from december  to december  the revolver is secured by substantially all of the company s and its subsidiaries assets 
the amounts borrowed under the revolver bear interest  at our option  at the prime lending rate established by jpmorgan chase bank  na or libor plus 
we pay a fee on a quarterly basis of three sixteenths of one percent per annum on the weighted average unused portion of the revolver 
at december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  but we did have letters of credit outstanding totaling approximately million  which reduces the unused portion of the revolver 
more of the company s customers  especially in larger fabrication projects  are requiring the company to issue letters of credit in lieu of retainage 
thus  the company is issuing letters of credit for larger amounts and for longer periods of time than it did in past years 
we are required to maintain certain covenants  including balance sheet and cash flow ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
our board of directors approved a capital budget of approximately million for  which includes the purchase of equipment and additional yard and facility expansion or improvements 
included in the capital expenditure budget is million for the purchase and installation of equipment for a panel line system to facilitate our expansion into additional marine construction areas such as towboats  barges and mid body sections for offshore supply vessels 
management believes that during the next months its available funds  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures and its working capital needs 
however  the company may expand its operations through acquisitions in the future  which may require additional equity or debt financing 
also  job awards may require us to issue additional letters of credit  further reducing the unused portion of the revolver 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table sets forth an aggregation of the company s contractual obligations and commitments as of december   in thousands 
totals less than year to years thereafter operating leases purchase commitment equipment operating leases are commitments for office space  office equipment and equipment rentals 
purchase commitment equipment is a commitment related to a purchase order agreements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is not a party to any contract or other obligation not included in its balance sheet that has  or is reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on its financial condition
