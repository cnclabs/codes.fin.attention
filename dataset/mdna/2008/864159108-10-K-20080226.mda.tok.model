item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sale  purchase  ownership  and use of firearms are subject to thousands of federal  state and local governmental regulations 
the basic federal laws are the national firearms act  the federal firearms act  and the gun control act of these laws generally prohibit the private ownership of fully automatic weapons and place certain restrictions on the interstate sale of firearms unless certain licenses are obtained 
the company does not manufacture fully automatic weapons  other than for the law enforcement market  and holds all necessary licenses under these federal laws 
from time to time  congressional committees review proposed bills relating to the regulation of firearms 
these proposed bills generally seek either to restrict or ban the sale and  in some cases  the ownership of various types of firearms 
several states currently have laws in effect similar to the aforementioned legislation 
until november   the brady law mandated a nationwide five day waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun 
as of november   the national instant check system  which applies to both handguns and long guns  replaced the five day waiting period 
the company believes that the brady law and the national instant check system have not had a significant effect on the company s sales of firearms  nor does it anticipate any impact on sales in the future 
on september   the crime bill banned so called assault weapons 
all the company s then manufactured commercially sold long guns were exempted by name as legitimate sporting firearms 
this ban expired by operation of law on september  the company remains strongly opposed to laws which would restrict the rights of law abiding citizens to lawfully acquire firearms 
the company believes that the lawful private ownership of firearms is guaranteed by the second amendment to the united states constitution and that the widespread private ownership of firearms in the united states will continue 
however  there can be no assurance that the regulation of firearms will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such restriction would not have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
firearms litigation the following disclosures within firearms litigation are identical to the disclosures within firearms litigation in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the notes to the financial statements contingent liabilities 
as of december   the company is a defendant in approximately lawsuits involving its products and is aware of certain other such claims 
these lawsuits and claims fall into two categories i those that claim damages from the company related to allegedly defective product design which stem from a specific incident 
pending lawsuits and claims are based principally on the theory of strict liability but also may be based on negligence  breach of warranty  and other legal theories  and ii those brought by cities or other governmental entities  and individuals against firearms manufacturers  distributors and dealers seeking to recover damages allegedly arising out of the misuse of firearms by third parties in the commission of homicides  suicides and other shootings involving juveniles and adults 
the complaints by municipalities seek damages  among other things  for the costs of medical care  police and emergency services  public health services  and the maintenance of courts  prisons  and other services 
in certain instances  the plaintiffs seek to recover for decreases in property values and loss of business within the city due to criminal violence 
in addition  nuisance abatement and or injunctive relief is sought to change the design  manufacture  marketing and distribution practices of the various defendants 
these suits allege  among other claims  strict liability or negligence in the design of products  public nuisance  negligent entrustment  negligent distribution  deceptive or fraudulent advertising  violation of consumer protection statutes and conspiracy or concert of action theories 
most of these cases do not allege a specific injury to a specific individual as a result of the misuse or use of any of the company s products 
the company has expended significant amounts of financial resources and management time in connection with product liability litigation 
management believes that  in every case involving firearms  the allegations are unfounded  and that the shootings and any results therefrom were due to negligence or misuse of the firearms by third parties or the claimant  and that there should be no recovery against the company 
defenses further exist to the suits brought by governmental entities based  among other reasons  on established state law precluding recovery for essential government services  the remoteness of the claims  the types of damages sought to be recovered  and limitations on the extraterritorial authority which may be exerted by a city  municipality  county or state under state and federal law  including state and federal constitutions 
the only case against the company alleging liability for criminal shootings by third parties to ever be permitted to go before a constitutional jury  hamilton  et al 
v 
accu tek  et al  resulted in a defense verdict in favor of the company on february  in that case  numerous firearms manufacturers and distributors had been sued  alleging damages as a result of alleged negligent sales practices and industry wide liability 
the company and its marketing and distribution practices were exonerated from any claims of negligence in each of the seven cases decided by the jury 
in subsequent proceedings involving other defendants  the new york court of appeals as a matter of law confirmed that no legal duty existed under the circumstances to prevent or investigate criminal misuses of a manufacturer s lawfully made products  and liability of firearms manufacturers could not be apportioned under a market share theory 
more recently  the new york court of appeals on october  declined to hear the appeal from the decision of the new york supreme court  appellate division  affirming the dismissal of new york attorney general eliot spitzer s public nuisance suit against the company and other manufacturers and distributors of firearms 
in its decision  the appellate division relied heavily on hamilton in concluding that it was legally inappropriate  impractical  unrealistic and unfair to attempt to hold firearms manufacturers responsible under theories of public nuisance for the criminal acts of others

the dismissal of the washington  dc municipal lawsuit was sustained on appeal  but individual plaintiffs were permitted to proceed to discovery and attempt to identify the manufacturers of the firearms used in their shootings as machine guns under the city s strict liability law 
on april   the dc court of appeals  in an en banc hearing  unanimously dismissed all negligence and public nuisance claims  but let stand individual claims based upon a washington  dc act imposing strict liability for manufacturers of machine guns 
based on present information  none of the company s products has been identified with any of the criminal assaults which form the basis of the individual claims 
the writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court regarding the constitutionality of the washington  dc act was denied and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings 
the defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the case based upon the protection of lawful commerce in arms act  which motion was granted on may  the individual plaintiffs and the district of columbia  which has subrogation claims in regard to the individual plaintiffs  appealed 
on january   the district of columbia court of appeals unanimously upheld the dismissal 
plaintiffs have until february   to move for rehearing en banc 
the indiana court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the gary case by the trial court  but the indiana supreme court reversed this dismissal and remanded the case for discovery proceedings on december  gary is scheduled to begin trial in the defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa 
the state court judge held the plcaa unconstitutional and the defendants filed a motion with the indiana court of appeals asking it to accept interlocutory appeal on the issue  which appeal was accepted on february  on october   the indiana appellate court affirmed  holding that the plcaa does not apply to the city s claims 
a petition for rehearing was filed in the appellate court and denied on january  a petition to transfer the appeal to the supreme court of indiana was filed on february  in the previously reported new york city municipal case  the defendants moved to dismiss the suit pursuant to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act 
the trial judge found the act to be constitutional but denied the defendants motion to dismiss the case  stating that the act was not applicable to the suit 
the defendants were given leave to appeal and in fact have appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
that appeal remains pending 
in the naacp case  on may   an advisory jury returned a verdict rejecting the naacp s claims 
on july   judge jack b 
weinstein entered an order dismissing the naacp lawsuit  but this order contained lengthy dicta which defendants believe are contrary to law and fact 
appeals by both sides were filed  but plaintiffs withdrew their appeal 
on august   the united states court of appeals for the second circuit granted the naacp s motion to dismiss the defendants appeal of judge weinstein s order denying defendants motion to strike his dicta made in his order dismissing the naacp s case  and the defendants motion for summary disposition was denied as moot 
the ruling of the second circuit effectively confirmed the decision in favor of defendants and brought this matter to a conclusion 
legislation has been passed in approximately states precluding suits of the type brought by the municipalities mentioned above 
on the federal level  the protection of lawful commerce in arms act was signed by president bush on october  the act requires dismissal of suits against manufacturers arising out of the lawful sale of their products for harm resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm by a third party 
the company is pursuing dismissal of each action involving such claims  including the municipal cases described above 
the company was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice on march  from the previously reported arnold case 
the matter was thus concluded with no payment by the company 
punitive damages  as well as compensatory damages  are demanded in certain of the lawsuits and claims 
aggregate claimed amounts presently exceed product liability accruals and applicable insurance coverage 
for claims made after july   coverage is provided on an annual basis for losses exceeding million per claim  or an aggregate maximum loss of million annually  except for certain new claims which might be brought by governments or municipalities after july   which are excluded from coverage 
product liability claim payments are made when appropriate if  as  and when claimants and the company reach agreement upon an amount to finally resolve all claims 
legal costs are paid as the lawsuits and claims develop  the timing of which may vary greatly from case to case 
a time schedule cannot be determined in advance with any reliability concerning when payments will be made in any given case 
provision is made for product liability claims based upon many factors related to the severity of the alleged injury and potential liability exposure  based upon prior claim experience 
because our experience in defending these lawsuits and claims is that unfavorable outcomes are typically not probable or estimable  only in rare cases is an accrual established for such costs 
in most cases  an accrual is established only for estimated legal defense costs 
product liability accruals are periodically reviewed to reflect then current estimates of possible liabilities and expenses incurred to date and reasonably anticipated in the future 
threatened product liability claims are reflected in our product liability accrual on the same basis as actual claims  ie  an accrual is made for reasonably anticipated possible liability and claims handling expenses on an ongoing basis 
a range of reasonably possible loss relating to unfavorable outcomes cannot be made 
however  in product liability cases in which a dollar amount of damages is claimed  the amount of damages claimed  which totaled million and at december  and  respectively  are set forth as an indication of possible maximum liability that the company might be required to incur in these cases regardless of the likelihood or reasonable probability of any or all of this amount being awarded to claimants as a result of adverse judgments that are sustained on appeal 
as of december  and  the company was a defendant in and lawsuits  respectively  involving its products and is aware of other such claims 
during the year ended december  and  respectively  and claims were filed against the company  and claims were dismissed  and and claims were settled 
the average cost per settled claim was  in during the years ended december  and  the company incurred product liability expense of million and million  respectively  which includes the cost of outside legal fees  insurance  and other expenses incurred in the management and defense of product liability matters 
the company management monitors the status of known claims and the product liability accrual  which includes amounts for asserted and unasserted claims 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with special and corporate counsel  it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period

environmental the company is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations and related state laws 
these laws generally relate to potential obligations to remove or mitigate the environmental effects of the disposal or release of certain pollutants at the company s manufacturing facilities and at third party or formerly owned sites at which contaminants generated by the company may be located 
this requires the company to make capital and other expenses 
the company is committed to achieving high standards of environmental quality and product safety  and strives to provide a safe and healthy workplace for its employees and others in the communities in which it operates 
in an effort to comply with federal and state laws and regulations  the company has programs in place that monitor compliance with various environmental regulations 
however  in the normal course of its operations  the company is subject to occasional governmental proceedings and orders pertaining to waste disposal  air emissions  and water discharges into the environment 
the company believes that it is generally in compliance with applicable environmental regulations 
however  the company cannot assure that the outcome of any environmental proceedings and orders will not have a material adverse effect on the business 
reliance on two facilities the newport  new hampshire and prescott  arizona facilities are critical to the company s success 
these facilities house the company s principal production  research  development  engineering  design  and shipping 
any event that causes a disruption of the operation of either of these facilities for even a relatively short period of time might have a material adverse affect on the company s ability to produce and ship products and to provide service to its customers 
availability of raw materials third parties supply the company with various raw materials for its firearms and castings  such as fabricated steel components  walnut  birch  beech  maple and laminated lumber for rifle and shotgun stocks  wax  ceramic material  metal alloys  various synthetic products and other component parts 
there is a limited supply of these materials in the marketplace at any given time  which can cause the purchase prices to vary based upon numerous market factors 
the company believes that it has adequate quantities of raw materials in inventory to provide ample time to locate and obtain additional items at then current market cost without interruption of its manufacturing operations 
however  if market conditions result in a significant prolonged inflation of certain prices or if adequate quantities of raw materials can not be obtained  the company s manufacturing processes could be interrupted and the company s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected

approximately of the company s total sales for the year ended december  were from the firearms segment  and were from investment castings 
export sales represent less than of firearms sales 
the company s design and manufacturing operations are located in the united states and substantially all product content is domestic 
the company s firearms are sold through a select number of independent wholesale distributors principally to the commercial sporting market 
the company manufactures and sells investment castings made from steel alloys for both outside customers and internal use in the firearms segment 
investment castings sold to outside customers  either directly to or through manufacturers representatives  represented of the company s total sales for the year ended december  in july  the company announced the cessation of the titanium castings portion of its investment casting operations 
this cessation of operations was completed in  at which time the company consolidated its arizona casting operations into its new hampshire casting operations 
because most of the company s competitors are not subject to public filing requirements and industry wide data is generally not available in a timely manner  the company is unable to compare its performance to other companies or specific current industry trends 
instead  the company measures itself against its own historical results 
the company does not consider its overall firearms business to be predictably seasonal  however  sales of many models of firearms are usually lower in the third quarter of the year 
results of operations year ended december   as compared to year ended december  summary unit data firearms unit data for orders  production  shipments and ending inventory  and castings setups a measure of foundry production are as follows units ordered note note units produced units shipped units company inventory units distributor inventory note units on backorder note note castings setups note prior to  the company received one cancelable annual firearms order in december from each of its distributors 
effective december   the company changed the manner in which distributors order firearms  and began receiving firm  non cancelable purchase orders on a frequent basis  with most orders for immediate delivery 
because of this change  comparable data for orders received and units on backorder for prior periods is not meaningful 
note distributor ending inventory as provided by the company s distributors 
orders received the company saw unusually high bookings during the st quarter of and then unusually low bookings during the rd quarter of bookings picked up again during the th quarter  gaining strength during the quarter 
the company s distributors indicated anecdotally that this order pattern was in line with what the overall industry experienced during this order pattern in was more volatile than the modest seasonality typically encountered in other years 
certain product lines were on backorder throughout the year  including new product introductions and low volume products that were not in regular production throughout the year 
the company initiated sales promotions during the rd and th quarters of the year to encourage demand for those product lines where manufacturing capacity exceeded current demand 
production throughout  the company continued to work on the transition from large scale batch production to lean manufacturing  with an emphasis on setting up manufacturing cells that facilitate flow production and pull systems 
to date  the company has converted over of its batch manufacturing processes to single piece or small batch flow cells 
in addition to continuing to set up flow cells  the next phase of the lean transition includes developing pull systems to link the assembly cells  component manufacturing cells  and parts suppliers 
in the first half of  unit shipments exceeded production and there was a significant reduction in finished goods inventory 
there was also a significant reduction in work in process inventory in the first half of as available work in process inventory allowed the company to produce more units than its staffing and manufacturing processes would have otherwise allowed 
as a result of reducing gross inventory by million in the second half of and by million in the first half of  including significant reductions in work in process inventory  many issues with design for manufacturability  poor machinery and tool reliability  weak manufacturing processes  long machine changeover times  and vendor supply were identified 
the company has made partial progress in addressing these issues with careful re engineering of both our product and component designs and manufacturing processes as problems were identified  with the net result for certain product lines of significantly reduced factory throughput time  improved quality  and modestly improved productivity 
the rate of product returns from firearms in service less than year dropped by approximately from the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of the company was also able to increase unit production by approximately from to during the nd half of  the company slowed its rapid  wide spread draw down of inventory and increased the foundry output to replenish component part shortages 
gross inventory was relatively unchanged during the nd half of production rates started to increase late in as a result of the months of effort spent addressing manufacturing process and design for manufacturability issues and as a result of the increased availability of investment cast component parts 
nonetheless  the improvement process is ongoing with much work  especially engineering  still to be done to continue with the lean transition and to increase production capacity 
sales consolidated net sales were million in this represents a decrease of million or from consolidated net sales of million 
firearms segment net sales were million in this represents an increase of million or from firearm net sales of million 
firearms unit shipments increased in due to increased shipments of rifles and pistols  offset by a decline in shipments of revolvers and shotguns 
a modest price increase and a shift in product mix toward firearms with greater unit sales prices resulted in the greater percentage increase in sales than unit shipments 
casting segment net sales were million in this represents a decrease of million or from casting sales of million 
the casting sales decrease in primarily reflects the cessation of titanium casting operations  as previously announced by the company in july in  titanium casting sales were million or of total casting sales compared to million or in in addition  the company significantly increased prices to most external customers in the second half of the  seeking to improve margins and free up available capacity for additional internal use

excess and obsolete inventory prior to  the company adjusted production schedules to consume on hand raw material and wip inventories  regardless of customer demand for the finished goods so produced 
this practice led to increased investment in inventory  and an unbalanced finished goods inventory 
consistent with the change in the manner in which distributors order from the company  the company significantly changed its production scheduling philosophy from an annual production cycle to a customer demand pull system in the fourth quarter of under the company s new system  production is driven solely by customer demand 
as a result of this new production philosophy  it became apparent that the company had inventory in excess of its needs over the foreseeable future 
therefore  in  the company evaluated the adequacy of the excess and obsolescence inventory reserve and concluded that additional reserves were required to reflect the estimated recoverable value of excess inventories below lifo carrying cost 
the required reserve was estimated at million as of december  the company employed the same methodology and parameters in  which resulted in a reserve balance as of december  of million 
this reduction was principally caused by the increased impact of lifo in as evidenced by the lifo reserve representing of gross inventories at december   compared to at december  performance gross margin in  performance gross margin was million or of sales 
this was an increase of million or from the performance gross margin of million or of sales

b in  the company recognized an impairment charge of million related to machinery and equipment previously in the company s arizona investment casting operations 
in  the company recognized an impairment charge of million related to building improvements at the dorr building 
the company had planned to establish a titanium investment castings foundry at dorr  but that plan was aborted in c on april   the company sold a facility in arizona for million 
this facility had not been used in the company s operations for several years 
the company realized a gain of approximately million from this sale 
in  the million gain on sale of real estate reflects the sale of non manufacturing real property 
the company has three additional non manufacturing properties listed for sale  two in connecticut and one in new hampshire 
d in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized an asset impairment charge of million related to the dorr building  a non manufacturing property in new hampshire that has been for sale for an extended period of time without any meaningful market interest

firearms segment net sales were million in this represents an increase of million or from firearm net sales of million 
firearms unit shipments increased in due to increased shipments of revolvers  partially offset by a decline in shipments of shotguns  pistols  and rifles 
effective january   the company instituted a unilateral minimum distributor resale price policy for its firearms  which remains in effect 
this change in policy was well received by the company s distributors and did not appear to have an adverse effect on the company s firearm sales 
casting segment net sales were million in this represents an increase of million or from casting sales of million 
the casting sales increase was due primarily to the acceleration of titanium shipments related to the cessation of titanium casting operations  as previously announced by the company in july titanium casting sales accounted for million or of casting sales in the company continues to manufacture and sell steel investment castings for a wide variety of customers and end uses 
cost of products sold and gross margin consolidated cost of products sold was million in this represents an increase of million or from consolidated cost of products sold of million 
the gross margin as a percent of sales was in this represents a decline from the gross margin of as illustrated below december  net sales total cost of products sold  before lifo and overhead rate inventory adjustments and product liability note performance gross margin lifo and overhead rate inventory adjustments and product liability note gross margin performance gross margin is a measure of gross margin before taking into account the impact of lifo and overhead rate adjustments to inventory  and before product liability expenses 
note performance gross margin was favorably impacted by stronger sales  and was adversely impacted by an excess and obsolete inventory charge of million  compared to million in the impact of the excess and obsolete inventory charge was of sales in as compared to of sales in note gross margin was favorably impacted by a lifo liquidation of million and a reduction in product liability of million  and was adversely impacted by a reduction in inventory value of million related to overhead rate changes 
excess and obsolete inventory in prior years  the company received one cancelable annual order in december from each of its distributors 
effective december  the company changed the manner in which distributors order firearms  and began receiving firm  non cancelable purchase orders on a frequent basis  with most orders for immediate delivery 
in the past  the company adjusted production schedules to consume on hand raw material and wip inventories  regardless of customer demand for the finished goods so produced 
this practice led to increased investment in inventory  and an unbalanced finished goods inventory 
as a result of this new production philosophy  it became apparent the company had inventory in excess of its needs over the foreseeable future 
given ever changing market conditions  customer preferences and the anticipated introduction of new products  the company concluded that it was not prudent nor supportable to carry inventory at full cost beyond that needed during the next months 
therefore the company evaluated the adequacy of the excess and obsolescence inventory reserve and concluded that additional reserves were required to reflect the estimated recoverable value of excess inventories below lifo carrying cost 
the required reserve was estimated based on the following parameters  and resulted in an excess and obsolete expense of million and a reserve balance of million projected year of consumption required reserve and thereafter lifo during  gross inventories were reduced by million 
this reduction resulted in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs that prevailed in prior years as compared with the current cost of purchases  the effect of which decreased costs of products sold by approximately million 
there was no lifo liquidation in reduction in inventory generated positive cash flow for the company  partially offset by the tax impact of the consequent lifo liquidation  which generated negative cash flow as it created taxable income  resulting in higher tax payments 
product liability during the years ended december  and  the company incurred product liability expense of million and million  respectively  which includes the cost of outside legal fees  insurance  and other expenses incurred in the management and defense of product liability matters 
see footnote contingent liabilities for further discussion of the company s product liability 
overhead rate change in  the change in inventory value resulting from the change in the overhead rate used to absorb overhead expenses into inventory was a decrease of million 
this reduction in inventory value resulted in an increase to cost of products sold 
in  the change in inventory value as a result of a change in the overhead rate used to absorb overhead expenses into inventory was an increase of million 
this increase in inventory value resulted in a decrease to cost of products sold 
fourth quarter charge in the fourth quarter of  a million non cash inventory valuation adjustment  net of the lifo impact  was recorded to recognize inefficiencies in labor and overhead during a period of rapid inventory reduction 
this over absorption of labor and overhead was quantified by a physical inventory taken in the fourth quarter 
due to the timing of the physical inventory  the company was unable to quantify the impact of this delayed recognition of labor and overhead inefficiencies  if any  on the financial results of prior quarters 
as a consequence  raw material and work in process physical inventories are being performed at the end of each quarter until a permanent corrective action is established and determined to be adequate  making these physical inventories unnecessary 
these physical inventories were taken each quarter in and are expected to continue in selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses were million in this represents a decrease of million or from selling  general and administrative expenses of million 
the decrease reflects a reduction in advertising and sales promotion expenses  partially offset by increased personnel related expenses including million related to the retirement of the former chairman and chief executive officer 
other operating expenses income  net other operating expenses income  net consist of the following year ended december  gain on sale of operating assets a impairment of operating assets b gain on sale of real estate c total other operating expenses income  net a the gain on sale of operating assets is generated primarily from the sale of used machinery and equipment 
most of the machinery and equipment sold in was related to titanium investment casting

the company had planned to establish a titanium investment castings foundry at dorr  but that plan was aborted in in  the company recognized an impairment charge of million related to certain corporate assets and certain machinery and equipment in the castings segment 
c in  the million gain on sale of real estate reflects the sale of non manufacturing real property 
operating income operating income was million or of sales in this is a decrease of million from operating income of million or of sales 
interest income interest income was million in this represents an increase of million from interest income of million 
the increase is attributable to more favorable interest rates in

financial condition operations at december   the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
the company s pre lifo working capital of million  less the lifo reserve of million  resulted in working capital of million and a current ratio of to cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided in compared to is principally attributable to comparable reductions in gross inventory  offset by a more significant reduction in the lifo reserve in  and increased voluntary pension plan contributions in the increase in cash provided in compared to is principally a result of a million decrease in inventory in and various fluctuations in operating asset and liability accounts during compared to third parties supply the company with various raw materials for its firearms and castings  such as fabricated steel components  walnut  birch  beech  maple and laminated lumber for rifle and shotgun stocks  wax  ceramic material  metal alloys  various synthetic products and other component parts 
there is a limited supply of these materials in the marketplace at any given time  which can cause the purchase prices to vary based upon numerous market factors 
the company believes that it has adequate quantities of raw materials in inventory to provide ample time to locate and obtain additional items at then current market cost without interruption of its manufacturing operations 
however  if market conditions result in a significant prolonged inflation of certain prices or if adequate quantities of raw materials can not be obtained  the company s manufacturing processes could be interrupted and the company s financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
investing and financing capital expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
in  the company expects to spend approximately million on capital expenditures to purchase tooling for new product introductions and to upgrade and modernize manufacturing equipment  primarily at the newport firearms and pine tree castings divisions 
the company finances  and intends to continue to finance  all of these activities with funds provided by operations and current cash and short term investments 
on january   the company announced that its board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program 
during the fourth quarter of  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock  representing of the outstanding shares  in the open market at an average price of per share 
on september   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock  representing of the then outstanding shares  from entities controlled by members of the ruger family at a price of per share 
these purchases were made with cash held by the company and no debt was incurred 
there were no dividends paid in or the payment of future dividends depends on many factors  including internal estimates of future performance  then current cash and short term investments  and the company s need for funds 
the company does not expect to pay dividends in the near term 
on march   the company sold parcels of non manufacturing real property for million to william b 
ruger  jr  the company s former chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
the sale included substantially all of the company s raw land real property assets in new hampshire 
the sales price was based upon an independent appraisal  and the company recognized a gain of million on the sale 
on april   the company sold a non manufacturing facility in arizona for million 
this facility had not been used in the company s operations for several years 
the company realized a gain of approximately million from this sale 
in  the company amended its hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans so that employees will no longer accrue benefits under them effective december  this action freezes the benefits for all employees and prevents future hires from joining the plans  effective december  starting in  the company will provide supplemental discretionary contributions to substantially all employees individual k accounts 
in late  after authorizing the freeze amendment to its hourly and salaried defined benefit pension plans  the company contributed an additional million to the plans 
the intent of this discretionary contribution is to reduce the amount of time that the company will be required to continue to operate the frozen plans 
the ongoing cost of running the plans even if frozen is approximately  per year  which includes pbgc premiums  actuary and audit fees  and other expenses 
in and future years  the company will be required to make cash contributions to the two defined benefit pension plans according to the new rules of the pension protection act of the annual contributions will be based on the amount of the unfunded plan liabilities derived from the frozen benefits and will not include liabilities for any future accrued benefits for any new or existing participants 
the total amount of these future cash contributions will be dependent on the investment returns generated by the plans assets and the then applicable discount rates used to calculate the plans liabilities 
the cash contribution for the defined benefit plans is not expected to exceed million 
in future years  the total annual cash outlays for retirement benefits  which would include the continuing funding of the two defined benefit pension plans and the new supplemental discretionary k contributions  are expected to be comparable to the previous retirement funding levels 
in february  the company made lump sum benefit payments to two participants in its only non qualified defined benefit plan  the supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
these payments  which totaled million  represented the actuarial present value of the participants accrued benefit as of the date of payment 
only one  retired participant remains in this plan 
historically  the company has not required external financing 
based on its unencumbered assets  the company believes it has the ability to raise substantial amounts of cash through issuance of short term or long term debt 
in the fourth quarter of  the company secured a million credit facility  which terminates on december  this credit facility remains unused 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on the company s balance sheet as current liabilities at december  purchase obligations as used in the below table includes all agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
certain of the company s purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services that may not necessarily be enforceable or legally binding on the company  are also included in purchase obligations in the table 
certain of the company s purchase orders or contracts therefore included in the table may represent authorizations to purchase rather than legally binding agreements 
the company expects to fund all of these commitments with cash flows from operations and current cash and short terms investments 
payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the registrant s balance sheet under gaap total the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  upon the adoption of fin  the company commenced a review of all open tax years in all jurisdictions 
the company does not believe it has included any uncertain tax positions in its federal income tax return or any of the state income tax returns it is currently filing 
the company has made an evaluation of the potential impact of additional state taxes being assessed by jurisdictions in which the company does not currently consider itself liable 
the company does not anticipate that such additional taxes  if any  would result in a material change to its financial position 
however  the company anticipates that it is more likely than not that additional state tax liabilities in the range of to million exist 
the company had previously recorded million relating to these additional state income taxes  including approximately million for the payment of interest and penalties 
this amount is included in income taxes payable at december  in connection with the adoption of fin  the company will include interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of its provision for taxes 
firearms legislation the following disclosures within firearms legislation are identical to the disclosures within item a risk factors firearms legislation 
the sale  purchase  ownership  and use of firearms are subject to thousands of federal  state and local governmental regulations 
the basic federal laws are the national firearms act  the federal firearms act  and the gun control act of these laws generally prohibit the private ownership of fully automatic weapons and place certain restrictions on the interstate sale of firearms unless certain licenses are obtained 
the company does not manufacture fully automatic weapons  other than for the law enforcement market  and holds all necessary licenses under these federal laws 
from time to time  congressional committees review proposed bills relating to the regulation of firearms 
these proposed bills generally seek either to restrict or ban the sale and  in some cases  the ownership of various types of firearms 
several states currently have laws in effect similar to the aforementioned legislation 
until november   the brady law mandated a nationwide five day waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun 
as of november   the national instant check system  which applies to both handguns and long guns  replaced the five day waiting period 
the company believes that the brady law and the national instant check system have not had a significant effect on the company s sales of firearms  nor does it anticipate any impact on sales in the future 
on september   the crime bill banned so called assault weapons 
all the company s then manufactured commercially sold long guns were exempted by name as legitimate sporting firearms 
this ban expired by operation of law on september  the company remains strongly opposed to laws which would restrict the rights of law abiding citizens to lawfully acquire firearms 
the company believes that the lawful private ownership of firearms is guaranteed by the second amendment to the united states constitution and that the widespread private ownership of firearms in the united states will continue 
however  there can be no assurance that the regulation of firearms will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such restriction would not have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
firearms litigation the following disclosures within firearms litigation are identical to the disclosures within item a risk factors firearms litigation and note to the notes to the financial statements contingent liabilities 
as of december   the company is a defendant in approximately lawsuits involving its products and is aware of certain other such claims 
these lawsuits and claims fall into two categories i those that claim damages from the company related to allegedly defective product design which stem from a specific incident 
pending lawsuits and claims are based principally on the theory of strict liability but also may be based on negligence  breach of warranty  and other legal theories  and ii those brought by cities or other governmental entities  and individuals against firearms manufacturers  distributors and dealers seeking to recover damages allegedly arising out of the misuse of firearms by third parties in the commission of homicides  suicides and other shootings involving juveniles and adults 
the complaints by municipalities seek damages  among other things  for the costs of medical care  police and emergency services  public health services  and the maintenance of courts  prisons  and other services 
in certain instances  the plaintiffs seek to recover for decreases in property values and loss of business within the city due to criminal violence 
in addition  nuisance abatement and or injunctive relief is sought to change the design  manufacture  marketing and distribution practices of the various defendants 
these suits allege  among other claims  strict liability or negligence in the design of products  public nuisance  negligent entrustment  negligent distribution  deceptive or fraudulent advertising  violation of consumer protection statutes and conspiracy or concert of action theories 
most of these cases do not allege a specific injury to a specific individual as a result of the misuse or use of any of the company s products 
the company has expended significant amounts of financial resources and management time in connection with product liability litigation 
management believes that  in every case involving firearms  the allegations are unfounded  and that the shootings and any results therefrom were due to negligence or misuse of the firearms by third parties or the claimant  and that there should be no recovery against the company 
defenses further exist to the suits brought by governmental entities based  among other reasons  on established state law precluding recovery for essential government services  the remoteness of the claims  the types of damages sought to be recovered  and limitations on the extraterritorial authority which may be exerted by a city  municipality  county or state under state and federal law  including state and federal constitutions 
the only case against the company alleging liability for criminal shootings by third parties to ever be permitted to go before a constitutional jury  hamilton  et al 
v 
accu tek  et al  resulted in a defense verdict in favor of the company on february  in that case  numerous firearms manufacturers and distributors had been sued  alleging damages as a result of alleged negligent sales practices and industry wide liability 
the company and its marketing and distribution practices were exonerated from any claims of negligence in each of the seven cases decided by the jury 
in subsequent proceedings involving other defendants  the new york court of appeals as a matter of law confirmed that no legal duty existed under the circumstances to prevent or investigate criminal misuses of a manufacturer s lawfully made products  and liability of firearms manufacturers could not be apportioned under a market share theory 
more recently  the new york court of appeals on october  declined to hear the appeal from the decision of the new york supreme court  appellate division  affirming the dismissal of new york attorney general eliot spitzer s public nuisance suit against the company and other manufacturers and distributors of firearms 
in its decision  the appellate division relied heavily on hamilton in concluding that it was legally inappropriate  impractical  unrealistic and unfair to attempt to hold firearms manufacturers responsible under theories of public nuisance for the criminal acts of others

the dismissal of the washington  dc municipal lawsuit was sustained on appeal  but individual plaintiffs were permitted to proceed to discovery and attempt to identify the manufacturers of the firearms used in their shootings as machine guns under the city s strict liability law 
on april   the dc court of appeals  in an en banc hearing  unanimously dismissed all negligence and public nuisance claims  but let stand individual claims based upon a washington  dc act imposing strict liability for manufacturers of machine guns 
based on present information  none of the company s products has been identified with any of the criminal assaults which form the basis of the individual claims 
the writ of certiorari to the united states supreme court regarding the constitutionality of the washington  dc act was denied and the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings 
the defendants subsequently moved to dismiss the case based upon the protection of lawful commerce in arms act  which motion was granted on may  the individual plaintiffs and the district of columbia  which has subrogation claims in regard to the individual plaintiffs  appealed 
on january   the district of columbia court of appeals unanimously upheld the dismissal 
plaintiffs have until february   to move for rehearing en banc 
the indiana court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the gary case by the trial court  but the indiana supreme court reversed this dismissal and remanded the case for discovery proceedings on december  gary is scheduled to begin trial in the defendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act plcaa 
the state court judge held the plcaa unconstitutional and the defendants filed a motion with the indiana court of appeals asking it to accept interlocutory appeal on the issue  which appeal was accepted on february  on october   the indiana appellate court affirmed  holding that the plcaa does not apply to the city s claims 
a petition for rehearing was filed in the appellate court and denied on january  a petition to transfer the appeal to the supreme court of indiana was filed on february  in the previously reported new york city municipal case  the defendants moved to dismiss the suit pursuant to the protection of lawful commerce in arms act 
the trial judge found the act to be constitutional but denied the defendants motion to dismiss the case  stating that the act was not applicable to the suit 
the defendants were given leave to appeal and in fact have appealed the decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit 
that appeal remains pending 
in the naacp case  on may   an advisory jury returned a verdict rejecting the naacp s claims 
on july   judge jack b 
weinstein entered an order dismissing the naacp lawsuit  but this order contained lengthy dicta which defendants believe are contrary to law and fact 
appeals by both sides were filed  but plaintiffs withdrew their appeal 
on august   the united states court of appeals for the second circuit granted the naacp s motion to dismiss the defendants appeal of judge weinstein s order denying defendants motion to strike his dicta made in his order dismissing the naacp s case  and the defendants motion for summary disposition was denied as moot 
the ruling of the second circuit effectively confirmed the decision in favor of defendants and brought this matter to a conclusion 
legislation has been passed in approximately states precluding suits of the type brought by the municipalities mentioned above 
on the federal level  the protection of lawful commerce in arms act was signed by president bush on october  the act requires dismissal of suits against manufacturers arising out of the lawful sale of their products for harm resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a firearm by a third party 
the company is pursuing dismissal of each action involving such claims  including the municipal cases described above 
the company was voluntarily dismissed with prejudice on march  from the previously reported arnold case 
the matter was thus concluded with no payment by the company 
punitive damages  as well as compensatory damages  are demanded in certain of the lawsuits and claims 
aggregate claimed amounts presently exceed product liability accruals and applicable insurance coverage 
for claims made after july   coverage is provided on an annual basis for losses exceeding million per claim  or an aggregate maximum loss of million annually  except for certain new claims which might be brought by governments or municipalities after july   which are excluded from coverage 
product liability claim payments are made when appropriate if  as  and when claimants and the company reach agreement upon an amount to finally resolve all claims 
legal costs are paid as the lawsuits and claims develop  the timing of which may vary greatly from case to case 
a time schedule cannot be determined in advance with any reliability concerning when payments will be made in any given case 
provision is made for product liability claims based upon many factors related to the severity of the alleged injury and potential liability exposure  based upon prior claim experience 
because our experience in defending these lawsuits and claims is that unfavorable outcomes are typically not probable or estimable  only in rare cases is an accrual established for such costs 
in most cases  an accrual is established only for estimated legal defense costs 
product liability accruals are periodically reviewed to reflect then current estimates of possible liabilities and expenses incurred to date and reasonably anticipated in the future 
threatened product liability claims are reflected in our product liability accrual on the same basis as actual claims  ie  an accrual is made for reasonably anticipated possible liability and claims handling expenses on an ongoing basis 
a range of reasonably possible loss relating to unfavorable outcomes cannot be made 
however  in product liability cases in which a dollar amount of damages is claimed  the amount of damages claimed  which totaled million and at december  and  respectively  are set forth as an indication of possible maximum liability that the company might be required to incur in these cases regardless of the likelihood or reasonable probability of any or all of this amount being awarded to claimants as a result of adverse judgments that are sustained on appeal 
as of december  and  the company was a defendant in and lawsuits  respectively  involving its products and is aware of other such claims 
during the year ended december  and  respectively  and claims were filed against the company  and claims were dismissed  and and claims were settled 
the average cost per settled claim was  in during the years ended december  and  the company incurred product liability expense of million and million  respectively  which includes the cost of outside legal fees  insurance  and other expenses incurred in the management and defense of product liability matters 
the company management monitors the status of known claims and the product liability accrual  which includes amounts for asserted and unasserted claims 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with special and corporate counsel  it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period

the company believes that it is generally in compliance with applicable environmental regulations and the outcome of such proceedings and orders will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the company

the company expects to realize its deferred tax assets through tax deductions against future taxable income 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses recognized and incurred during the reporting period then ended 
the company bases estimates on prior experience  facts and circumstances  and other assumptions  including those reviewed with actuarial consultants and independent counsel  when applicable  that are believed to be reasonable 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the determination of its product liability accrual is a critical accounting policy 
the company s management reviews every lawsuit and claim at the outset and is in contact with independent and corporate counsel on an ongoing basis 
the provision for product liability claims is based upon many factors  which vary for each case 
these factors include the type of claim  nature and extent of injuries  historical settlement ranges  jurisdiction where filed  and advice of counsel 
an accrual is established for each lawsuit and claim  when appropriate  based on the nature of each such lawsuit or claim 
amounts are charged to product liability expense in the period in which the company becomes aware that a claim or  in some instances a threat of claim  has been made when potential losses or costs of defense can be reasonably estimated 
such amounts are determined based on the company s experience in defending similar claims 
occasionally  charges are made for claims made in prior periods because the cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  exceed amounts already provided 
likewise credits may be taken if cumulative actual costs incurred for that claim  or reasonably expected to be incurred in the future  are less than amounts previously provided 
while it is not possible to forecast the outcome of litigation or the timing of costs  in the opinion of management  after consultation with independent and corporate counsel  it is not probable and is unlikely that litigation  including punitive damage claims  will have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the company  but may have a material impact on the company s financial results for a particular period 
the company believes the valuation of its inventory and the related excess and obsolescence reserve is also a critical accounting policy 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost  principally determined by the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
an actual valuation of inventory under the lifo method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and prevailing inventory costs existing at that time 
the company determines its excess and obsolescence reserve by projecting the year in which inventory will be consumed into a finished product 
given ever changing market conditions  customer preferences and the anticipated introduction of new products  it does not seem prudent nor supportable to carry inventory at full cost beyond that needed during the next months 
therefore  the company estimates its excess and obsolescence inventory reserve based on the following parameters projected year of consumption required reserve and thereafter recent accounting pronouncements in september  fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of fas are effective for the fiscal year beginning january  the fasb has deferred the implementation of fas by one year for certain non financial assets and liabilities such as this will be effective for the fiscal year beginning january  the adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows

fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
fas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fas r is effective for the fiscal year beginning january   and will be adopted by the company in the first quarter of the adoption of fas r is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
forward looking statements and projections the company may  from time to time  make forward looking statements and projections concerning future expectations 
such statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain qualifying risks and uncertainties  such as market demand  sales levels of firearms  anticipated castings sales and earnings  the need for external financing for operations or capital expenditures  the results of pending litigation against the company including lawsuits filed by mayors  state attorneys general and other governmental entities and membership organizations  and the impact of future firearms control and environmental legislation  any one or more of which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
the company undertakes no obligation to publish revised forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date such forward looking statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of subsequent unanticipated events 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changing interest rates on its investments  which consists primarily of united states treasury instruments with short term less than one year maturities and cash 
the interest rate market risk implicit in the company s investments at any given time is low  as the investments mature within short periods and the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash 
the company has not undertaken any actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates over the next year would not materially impact the company s earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s investments
