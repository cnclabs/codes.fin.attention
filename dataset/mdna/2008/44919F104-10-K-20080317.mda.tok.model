item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item business overview we are a healthcare services management company  integrating both medical and psychosocial treatment modalities  providing behavioral health management services to health plans  employers  criminal justice and government agencies through a network of licensed and company managed healthcare providers 
we also research  develop  license and commercialize innovative physiological  nutritional and behavioral treatment programs 
we manage behavioral health disorders through our subsidiary  comprehensive care corporation compcare  in which we acquired a majority controlling interest in january we approach the management of behavioral health disorders with a focus on using the latest medical and health technology towards improved outcomes and outpatient treatment 
we offer disease management programs for substance dependence built around our patented prometa treatment programs for alcoholism and dependence to cocaine and methamphetamines 
our proprietary prometa treatment programs which integrate behavioral  nutritional and medical components are available only through physicians and other treatment providers who have entered into licensing agreements with us for the use of our treatment programs 
we also manage medical practices and treatment centers that offer the prometa treatment programs  as well as other treatments for substance dependencies 
our prometa based disease management programs allow healthcare providers who license our technology to offer an integrated approach for the treatment of substance dependence that can be tailored for the specific needs of patients with medical and psychiatric comorbidities 
compcare manages the delivery of a continuum of psychiatric and substance abuse services to commercial  medicare and medicaid members on behalf of employers  health plans  government organizations  third party claims administrators and commercial and other group purchasers of behavioral healthcare services 
the customer base for compcare s services includes both private and governmental entities 
our unique prometa treatment programs for alcohol  cocaine and methamphetamine dependence integrate physiological  nutritional and psychosocial therapies designed to help patients meet their individual recovery goals 
prometa treatment programs seek to target key neuroreceptors to help relieve cravings and improve cognitive function  restore nutritional balance and initiate psychosocial counseling  so that patients can fully engage in the entire recovery process 
our two proprietary prometa treatment programs  one for alcohol dependence and the other for stimulant dependence or a combination of alcohol and stimulant dependence  incorporate fda approved oral and iv medications prescribed off label and administered in a unique dosing algorithm 
the pharmacologic intervention is integrated with nutritional support and the selection and initiation of psychosocial therapy 
as a result  our prometa treatment programs represent an innovative approach to substance dependence designed to address physiological  nutritional and psychosocial aspects of the disease  and are thereby intended to offer patients an opportunity to achieve sustained recovery 
historically  the disease of addiction has been treated primarily through behavioral intervention  with fairly high relapse rates 
we believe the prometa treatment programs offer an advantage to traditional alternatives because they provide a treatment methodology that is discreet and only mildly sedating and can be initiated in only three days  with a two day follow up treatment three weeks later for addictive stimulants 
our prometa 
table of contents treatment programs also provide for one month of prescription medication and nutritional supplements  combined with psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy chosen by the patient in conjunction with their treatment provider 
the medical treatment is followed by continuing care  such as individual or group counseling  as a key part of recovery 
limited initial clinical observations indicate that our treatment programs may improve cognitive function  reduce withdrawal symptoms  be associated with higher initial completion rates than conventional treatments  and reduce physical cravings which can be a major factor in relapse  thus allowing patients to more meaningfully engage in counseling or other forms of psychosocial therapy 
we believe the short initial treatment period when using our prometa treatment programs is a major advantage over traditional inpatient detoxification treatments and residential treatment programs  which typically consist of up to days of combined inpatient detoxification and recovery in a rehabilitation or residential treatment center 
treatment with prometa does not require an extensive stay at an inpatient facility 
rather  the prometa treatment programs offer the convenience of a three day treatment for addictive stimulants there is a two day follow up treatment three weeks later and can be administered on an outpatient basis 
this is particularly relevant since results from the national survey on drug use and health reported that approximately of adults using illicit drugs in were employed  and loss of time from work can be a significant deterrent from seeking treatment 
we have been unprofitable since our inception in and expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next twelve months 
however  we believe our operating losses will decrease and we will achieve positive cash flows within the next two years as the number of patients treated with the prometa treatment program increases 
accordingly  our historical operations and financial information are not necessarily indicative of future operating results  financial condition or ability to operate profitably as a commercial enterprise 
we believe that our business and operations as outlined above are in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
however  the healthcare industry is highly regulated  and the criteria are often vague and subject to change and interpretation by various federal and state legislatures  courts  enforcement and regulatory authorities 
additional clinical studies are underway to evaluate our treatment programs and confirm initial studies and reports from physicians using them in their practices 
the medications used in the prometa treatment programs are fda approved for uses other than treating dependence on alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine 
therefore  the risks and benefits of using those medications to treat dependence on those substances have not been evaluated by the fda  which may not find them to be sufficiently safe or effective 
we do not manufacture  distribute or sell any medications and have no relationship with any manufacturers or distributors of medications used in the prometa treatment programs 
only a treating physician can determine if the prometa treatment program is appropriate for any individual patient 
our future prospects are subject to the legal  regulatory  commercial and scientific risks outlined above and in item a risk factors 
market for prometa substance dependence is a worldwide problem with prevalence rates continuing to rise despite the efforts by national and local health authorities to curtail its growth 
substance dependence disorders affect many people and have wide ranging social consequences 
in  an estimated million americans aged and older suffered from alcohol or other forms of drug abuse or dependence  of which million  or  received some kind of treatment  according to the national survey on drug use and health published by the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa  an agency of the us department of health and human services 
furthermore  according to the survey  approximately million americans age and older  or of the population  are reported as having tried methamphetamine  and the percentage of methamphetamine use characterized as abuse or dependence increased from to findings from the treatment episode data set teds highlights published by samhsa s office of applied studies show that the proportion of admissions for primary abuse of methamphetamine as a percent of substance abuse treatment admissions increased from in to in summarizing data from the office of national drug control policy ondcp and the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism niaaa  the economic cost of alcohol and drug abuse exceeds billion annually in the us  including billion in healthcare costs and approximately billion in productivity losses 
despite these staggering figures  it is a testament to the unmet need in the market that only of those who need 
table of contents treatment actually receive help 
traditional treatment methods are often not particularly effective  especially when it comes to those who are dependent on stimulants 
there are approximately  facilities reporting to samhsa that provide substance abuse treatment on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
historically  the disease of substance dependence has been treated primarily through behavioral intervention  with fairly high relapse rates 
samhsa s teds report states that in only of those treated for alcoholism and of those treated for cocaine completed detoxification  and that alcohol and cocaine outpatient treatment completion rates were only and  respectively 
pharmacological options for alcohol dependence exist and a number of pharmaceutical companies have introduced or announced drugs to treat alcohol dependence 
these drugs may require chronic or long term administration 
in addition  several of these drugs are generally not to be used until the patient has already achieved abstinence  are generally administered on a chronic or long term continuing basis  and do not represent an integrated treatment approach to addiction 
we believe prometa can be used at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can also complement other existing treatments 
as such  our treatment programs offer a potentially valuable alternative or addition to traditional treatment methods 
it is commonly reported that addiction to methamphetamine is an epidemic rapidly spreading throughout the united states 
methamphetamine addicts are highly resistant to treatment and  even after intervention  relapse at very high rates 
methamphetamine use is also spreading to the workplace 
a study funded by the wal mart foundation in determined that each methamphetamine using employee costs his or her employer  per year in terms of lost productivity  absenteeism  higher healthcare costs and higher workers compensation costs 
for city  state and county governments and their taxpayers  methamphetamine abuse causes legal  medical  environmental and social problems 
a study entitled the criminal effect of meth on communities conducted in by the national association of counties  which surveyed counties in states  reported that of counties surveyed reported methamphetamine as their largest drug problem  with reporting increases in arrests involving methamphetamine starting three years earlier 
cocaine was reported as the number one drug problem in of the counties 
there are currently no generally accepted medical treatments for cocaine or methamphetamine dependence 
substance dependence as a disease scientific research indicates that not only can drugs interfere with normal brain functioning but can also have long lasting effects that persist even after the drug is no longer being used 
data indicates that at some point changes may occur in the brain that can turn drug and alcohol abuse into substance dependence a chronic  relapsing and sometimes fatal disease 
those dependent on drugs may suffer from compulsive drug craving and usage and be unable to stop drug use or remain drug abstinent without effective treatment 
professional medical treatment is often necessary to end this physiologically based compulsive behavior 
we believe that addressing the physiological basis of substance dependence as part of an integrated treatment program will improve clinical outcomes  reduce the cost of treating dependence  and reduce the cost to society by decreasing related criminality and violence and mitigating the costs associated with high risk behavior 
methamphetamine according to a national institute on drug abuse nida research report methamphetamine abuse and addiction january  the effects of methamphetamine use can include memory loss  aggression  psychotic behavior and heart and brain damage 
the damage to the brain caused by methamphetamine use appears similar to damage caused by alzheimer s disease  stroke and epilepsy 
methamphetamine is highly addictive and users trying to abstain from use may suffer withdrawal symptoms that include depression  anxiety  fatigue  paranoia  aggression  and intense cravings for the drug 
chronic methamphetamine use can cause violent behavior  anxiety  confusion  and insomnia 
users can also exhibit psychotic behavior including auditory hallucinations  mood disturbances  delusions  and paranoia  possibly resulting in homicidal or suicidal thoughts 
according to nida s report  methamphetamine linked to long term damage to brain cells march  use of methamphetamine can cause damage to the brain that is detectable months after the use of the drug 

table of contents alcohol the centers for disease control and prevention rank alcohol the number three preventable cause of death in the united states  with more than  deaths annually 
according to niaaa  of all deaths due to liver cirrhosis are alcohol related  with most of these deaths occurring in people to years old 
one study found that to of all emergency room trauma cases involve alcohol use roizen  j  alcohol and trauma  
another found that of asymptomatic alcoholic men exhibited evidence of cardiomyopathy rubin  e  the effects of alcoholism on skeletal and cardiac muscle  
the consequences of alcoholism and alcohol abuse affect most american families 
one study estimated that of all injury related hospital admissions are the result of alcoholism or alcohol problems waller j  diagnosis of alcoholism in the injured patient  
according to the national commission against drunk driving  nearly  americans are injured in alcohol related traffic crashes each year  resulting in  fatalities 
cocaine and crack cocaine cocaine and crack use are societal problems that place a heavy load upon our criminal justice system 
according to a bureau of justice statistics bulletin  prisoners in  published in october  of the  federal prisoners and of the million state prisoners were convicted of drug offenses 
the national institute of justice reports that over of all arrestees test positive for cocaine or crack 
the consequences of cocaine and crack use extend beyond the criminal justice system 
nida reports the medical complications of cocaine use can include heart arrhythmias and heart attacks  chest pain  respiratory failure  strokes  seizures and headaches  as well as abdominal pain and nausea 
nida also notes that there have been no medications available to treat cocaine dependence 
our solution prometa treatment programs people suffering from alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine dependence have a clinical disease  but are often characterized as having a social disorder or a lack of self discipline 
in this context traditional treatment approaches have generally focused on the psychosocial aspect of the disease 
while we recognize the psychological approach to substance dependence treatment is important  we believe that a more comprehensive approach to this multi factorial disease should be addressed as part of an integrated treatment approach intended to provide patients with an improved chance for recovery 
we believe our integrated approach will offer patients an opportunity to achieve their individual recovery goals 
current research indicates that substance dependence is associated with altered cortical activity and changes in neurotransmitter function in the specific areas of the brain which are critical to normal brain function 
moreover  changes in the neurochemistry of the brain may underlie the hallmarks of substance dependence  including tolerance  withdrawal symptoms  craving  decrease in cognitive function and propensity for relapse 
our prometa treatment programs include medically directed and supervised treatments  prescription medications and nutritional supplements  combined with psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy 
we provide a proprietary integrated treatment program to medical professionals 
the specific implementation of the treatment programs is at the discretion and judgment of the medical professionals providing care and tailored to individual patient needs 
the prometa treatment programs provide for a comprehensive physical examination  including specific laboratory tests  prior to initiation of treatment by the treating physician  to determine if the patient is appropriate for prometa prescription medications delivered in a unique dosing algorithm a nutritional plan and recommendations  designed to help facilitate and maintain the other aspects of recovery 
table of contents one month of prescription medications and nutritional supplements following the initial treatment individualized psychosocial counseling or other recovery oriented counseling the initiation of treatment under prometa involves the oral and intravenous administration of pharmaceuticals in a medically directed and supervised setting over a period of three days 
the medications used in the prometa treatment programs have been approved by the food and drug administration fda for uses other than treatment of substance dependence 
treatment generally takes place on an outpatient basis at a properly equipped outpatient setting or clinic  or at a hospital or other in patient facility  by physicians and healthcare providers who have licensed the rights to use our prometa treatment programs 
the outpatient nature of the treatment provides the opportunity for the care to be provided in a discreet manner and without long periods away from home or work 
the prometa treatment program for stimulant dependence provides for a second  two day administration at the facility  which takes place about three weeks after initiation of treatment 
following the initial three days  our treatment programs provide that patients receive one month of prescription medication  nutritional supplements  nutritional guidelines designed to assist in recovery  and individualized psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy 
initial results indicate that the prometa treatment programs may be associated with higher initial completion rates than conventional treatments  reduce cravings which can be a major factor in relapse and allow patients to more quickly engage in counseling or other forms of psychosocial therapy in a meaningful way 
these initial conclusions have been reported in the treatment of over  patients at licensed sites  commercial pilots and in research studies being conducted to study our treatment programs 
they may not be confirmed by additional double blind  placebo controlled research studies  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance of our treatment programs 
we believe the prometa treatment programs may offer an advantage to traditional alternatives for several reasons the prometa treatment programs are designed to address a spectrum of patient needs  including physiological  nutritional and psychological elements in an integrated way the prometa treatment programs include medically directed and supervised procedures designed to address neurochemical imbalances in the brain that may be caused or worsened by substance dependence 
the rationale for this approach is that by addressing the underlying physiological balance thought to be disrupted by substance dependence  dependent persons may be better able to address the behavioral psychological and environmental components of their disease treatment using the prometa treatment programs generally can be performed on an outpatient basis and does not require long periods away from home or work the prometa treatment programs may be initiated at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement other treatment modalities additionally  we provide training  education and other administrative services to assist physicians  healthcare providers and treatment centers with staff education  marketing and administrative support 
our strategy our business strategy is to provide quality treatment programs that will become the standard of care for those suffering from alcoholism and other substance dependencies in a cost effective manner 
we intend to grow our business through increased utilization from within existing and new licensees  additional managed treatment centers  and increased adoption of our prometa treatment programs and substance abuse disease management treatment approach by government agencies  criminal justice systems  managed care and other third party payers 

table of contents key elements of our business strategy include providing our substance abuse disease management program to managed care health plans for reimbursement on a case rate or capitated basis  utilizing the compcare infrastructure to provide some components of our services demonstrating the potential for improved clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness associated with using the prometa treatment programs  through commercial pilot studies with key managed care and other third party payers expanding the base of our self pay licensed treatment sites and managed treatment centers  focusing primarily on existing service areas seeking additional scientific and clinical research data to further validate the benefits of using the prometa treatment programs  through unrestricted grants for research studies by leading research institutions and preeminent researchers in the field of alcohol and substance abuse exploring opportunities in foreign markets disease management there are currently approximately million lives in the united states covered by various managed care programs  including preferred provider organizations ppos  health maintenance organizations hmos  self insured employers and managed medicare medicaid programs 
we believe our greatest opportunities for growth are in this market segment 
our proprietary disease management programs are designed to improve treatment outcomes and lower the utilization of medical and behavioral health plan services by high utilizers and high risk enrollees 
our disease management program includes the use of our prometa treatment programs  a proprietary information technology platform and database  predictive modeling  clinical algorithms  psychosocial programs  and integrated case management and coaching services 
compcare utilizes its infrastructure to provide many disease management services  including credentialing  peer review  monitoring  case management  coaching services  quality assurance and other standard behavioral healthcare services 
the proposed value proposition to our customers includes the following benefits increased worker productivity  by reducing workplace absenteeism  compensation claims  and job related injuries decreased emergency room and inpatient utilization decreased readmission rates medical cost savings we expect to gain leverage from our disease management program  which will allow us to market to managed care populations with one product and a relatively small  specialized sales force 
in addition  we believe that positive cost savings and clinical outcomes demonstrated in disease management with healthcare plans will provide a compelling motivation for speed of adoption by other health plans and other business sectors 

table of contents self pay patients licensees our principal source of revenues to date has been from license fees derived from the licensing of our prometa treatment programs to physicians and other licensed treatment providers 
although we plan to continue to provide such services to our existing licensees for the treatment of substance dependencies using our prometa treatment programs  we do not expect to significantly invest in or expand this line of business without positive returns on our investment 
accordingly  in we have significantly reduced our resources in each market area to more closely match our resources and expenditures with revenues from our licensees 
managed medical practices and treatment centers under the terms of full business service management agreements with medical professional corporations and treatment centers  we manage their business components and license the prometa treatment programs and use of our prometa trademark in exchange for management and licensing fees 
these treatment centers offer the prometa treatment programs for dependencies on alcohol  cocaine and methamphetamines  and also offer medical interventions for other substance dependencies 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the revenues and expenses of such managed treatment centers are included in our consolidated financial statements 
we currently manage two such treatment centers  the prometa center in santa monica  california and murray hill recovery in dallas  texas 
criminal justice systems and government agencies drug and alcohol offenders impact all divisions of criminal justice including law enforcement  drug courts  probation  and correctional facilities 
a significant number of state and federal prisoners receive alcohol treatment in prison or during the re entry period while under community supervision 
ondcp estimates that more than of the sentenced federal inmate population will have a diagnosable substance disorder that requires some type of drug abuse treatment program 
city  county  state and federal criminal justice systems are in need of a more beneficial and convenient treatment alternative 
we began to establish prometa as a covered treatment for city  state and county agencies in the criminal justice sectors in several states in and we will continue to leverage existing pilots and programs with governmental agencies to provide adoption and funding by criminal justice  state and local government systems 
however  while we have seen some early adoption  we will limit our investment in this sector due to the inherent inefficiencies we see at the present time in the public sector to adopt and implement our programs in a timely manner 
international operations we have received allowances  issuances or notices that patent grants are intended for inventions related to one or more of our treatment programs for the treatment of alcohol and stimulant dependence in the us  mexico  australia  new zealand  singapore  south africa  russia  ukraine  south korea  china and the european union 
we will consider future opportunities in these and other countries where our intellectual property is protected 
we currently offer the prometa treatment program as well as other treatments for dependencies in europe and central america  and we plan to continue to expand in these markets 

table of contents clinical data from research studies a key to our success will be the publication of results from research studies evaluating treatment with the prometa treatment programs conducted by leading research institutions and preeminent researchers in the field of alcohol and substance abuse 
studies funded by our unrestricted grants that are completed  pending or underway include completed studies an patient randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study of the prometa treatment program s acute and immediate effects on cravings and cognition in methamphetamine dependent subjects designed and supervised by harold urschel  md  completed in october top line results showed a statistically significant reduction in cravings versus placebo 
a patient open label study of the physiological component of the prometa treatment program for methamphetamine dependence conducted by dr 
urschel that was completed in  in which it was reported that more than of study participants experienced a significant clinical benefit measured through decrease in cravings  reduction of methamphetamine use and treatment retention after treatment  with no adverse events 
the results of this study were reported in october in a peer reviewed journal  mayo clinic proceedings 
a patient open label randomized controlled study of the prometa treatment programs in the treatment of alcohol dependence being conducted by jeffery wilkins  md  at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles completed in august top line results reported at days showed a decrease in median cravings and an reduction in mean percentage of total drinking days 
in february  sheryl smith  phd  a leading researcher in the field of neurosteroids  provided evidence supporting a mechanism of action underlying our prometa treatment programs at the neurobiology of addiction conference 
dr 
smith presented data from her research on methamphetamine dependent rats  describing the methamphetamine induced increase in the subunit of the gabaa receptor and the post treatment decrease of this pathological marker  which has been associated with states of hyper excitability and anxiety 
this receptor dysregulation and associated symptomatology has previously been associated with alcohol and neurosteroid withdrawal in animal studies  and suggests a common cause of cravings in substance dependent individuals

table of contents our operations healthcare services we commenced operations in july and signed our first licensing and administrative services agreement in november under our licensing agreements  we provide physicians and other licensed treatment providers access to our prometa treatment programs  education and training in the implementation and use of the licensed technology and marketing support 
we receive a fee for the licensed technology and related services generally on a per patient basis 
as of december   we had licensing agreements with physicians  hospitals and treatment providers for approximately sites throughout the united states  with approximately sites contributing to revenues in we continue to enter into agreements with additional healthcare providers to increase the availability of the prometa treatment programs 
as revenues are generally related to the number of patients treated  key indicators of our financial performance will be the number of facilities and healthcare providers that license our technology  and the number of patients that are treated by those providers using our prometa treatment programs 
since july  over  patients have completed treatment using our prometa treatment programs at our licensed sites  and in commercial pilots and research studies being conducted to study our treatment programs 
we currently manage two treatment centers  located in santa monica  california the prometa center  inc and dallas  texas murray hill recovery  llc  whose revenues and expenses are included in our consolidated financial statements 
to date  a substantial portion of our healthcare services revenues has been derived from license fees for the use of the prometa treatment program in treating self pay patients  and consolidation of self pay patient revenues from managed treatment centers 
we expect revenues from governmental agencies and other third party payers will increase as our prometa treatment program and disease management products are adopted and implemented by managed care providers  and state and county criminal justice systems 
furthermore  we believe additional positive results from published studies of our prometa treatment programs will enhance our efforts to increase third party reimbursement for providers using our treatment programs 
we do not operate our own healthcare facilities  employ our own treating physicians or provide medical advice or treatment to patients 
we provide services and access to tools that physicians may use to treat their patients as they determine appropriate 
the hospitals  licensed healthcare facilities  and physicians that contract for the use of our technology own their facilities or professional licenses  and control and are responsible for the clinical activities provided on their premises 
patients receive medical care in accordance with orders from their attending physicians 
physicians with license rights to use the prometa treatment programs exercise their independent medical judgment in determining the use and specific application of our treatment programs  and the appropriate course of care for each patient 
following the medical portion of the treatment procedure  physicians  local clinics and healthcare providers specializing in drug abuse treatment administer and provide the psychosocial component of the prometa treatment program 
behavioral health managed care services to date  all of our behavioral health managed care revenues have been derived from the operations of our consolidated subsidiary  compcare  in which we acquired a majority controlling interest on january compcare typically enters into contracts on an annual basis to provide managed behavioral healthcare and substance abuse treatment to clients members 
arrangements with clients fall into two broad categories capitation arrangements  where clients pay compcare a fixed fee per member per month  and fee for service and administrative service arrangements where compcare may manage behavioral healthcare programs or perform various managed care services 
approximately of compcare s revenues for the period january through december  were derived from capitation arrangements 
under capitation arrangements  compcare receives premiums from clients based on the number of covered members as reported by the clients 
compcare reviews membership eligibility records and other reported information to verify its accuracy in determining the amount of revenue to be recognized 
the amount of premiums received for each member is fixed at the beginning of the contract term 
these premiums may be subsequently adjusted  up or down  generally at the commencement of each renewal period 

table of contents for the period january through december   of behavioral health managed care services revenue was concentrated in contracts with six health plans to provide behavioral healthcare services under commercial  medicare  medicaid  and children s health insurance plans chip 
this includes a contract with a health plan to provide behavioral healthcare services to approximately  medicaid recipients in indiana  which represented approximately of behavioral health managed care services revenue for the period january through december  the term of each contract is generally for one year and is automatically renewable for additional one year periods unless terminated by either party by giving the requisite written notice 
competition healthcare services our healthcare services business focuses on providing licensing  administrative and management services to licensees that administer prometa and other treatment programs  including managed treatment centers that are licensed and or managed by us 
we compete with many types of substance dependence treatment methods  treatment facilities and other service providers 
conventional forms of treatment for alcohol dependence are usually divided into phases detoxification  which is typically conducted in medically directed and supervised environments rehabilitation  which is often conducted through short or long term therapeutic facilities or programs  most of which do not offer medical management options relapse prevention aftercare that is provided via structured outpatient treatment programs 
most medically managed treatments require long term usage of pharmaceuticals  resulting in low patient compliance 
conventional forms of treatment for stimulant dependence generally consist only of relapse prevention psychosocial and recovery oriented therapy  conducted through therapeutic programs 
regardless of the approach  there is great variability in the duration of treatment procedures  level of medical supervision  price to the patients and success rates 
one currently accepted practice for detoxifying patients from dependence on alcohol consists of heavily sedating the patient at an inpatient hospital facility for a period of to days 
due to the heavy sedation  the patient may need to be further observed for an additional to days 
this procedure  while medically necessary to prevent severe complications  eg seizures or delirium tremens when withdrawing these patients from alcohol  does not consistently relieve the patient s cravings or otherwise attempt to address the long term recovery of the patient 
further  the drugs typically used during this procedure the most commonly utilized medications are valium diazepam  ativan lorazepam  and xanax alprazolam can be addictive  require a time intensive dose tapering and washout period  and may cause side effects 
while withdrawal from cocaine or methamphetamine dependence is not considered to be life threatening  withdrawal symptoms can be extremely unpleasant and may lead to repeated relapses and treatment failures 
detoxification procedures typically involve the use of sedatives to assist patients through this difficult period 
following treatment  environmentally cue induced cravings  however  are especially pronounced and may re occur for months to years 
treatment programs there are approximately  facilities reporting to the substance abuse and mental health services administration samhsa that provide substance dependence medical treatment services on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
well known examples of residential treatment programs include the betty ford center  caron foundation  hazelden and sierra tucson 
in addition  individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices 
there appears to be no readily available reliable information about the success rates of these programs  nor agreed upon standards of how outcomes should be measured eg  self reported abstinence or reduction in days of heavy drinking 
many of these traditional treatment programs have established name recognition  and their treatments may be covered in large part by insurance or other third party payers 
to date  treatments using our prometa treatment programs have generally not been covered by insurance  and patients treated with the prometa treatment programs have been substantially self pay patients 

table of contents traditional treatment approaches for substance dependence focus mainly on group therapy  abstinence  and behavioral modification  while the disease s underlying physiology and pathology is rarely addressed  resulting in fairly high relapse rates 
currently therapies are beginning to target brain receptors thought to play a central role in the disease process 
we believe that our prometa treatment programs offer an improvement to traditional treatments because the integrated prometa treatment programs are designed to target the pathophysiology induced by chronic use of alcohol or other drugs in addition to nutritional and psychosocial aspects of substance dependence 
the abnormalities in brain function induced by chronic substance dependence may take weeks to years of drug abstinence to return to normal function  if at all 
we believe the prometa treatment programs offer an advantage to traditional alternatives because they provide an integrated treatment methodology that is discreet  mildly sedating and that can be initiated in only three days  with a second two day treatment three weeks later for addictive stimulants 
our prometa treatment programs also provide for one month of prescription medication and nutritional supplements  integrated with psychosocial or other recovery oriented therapy 
we further believe the short initial outpatient treatment period when using our prometa treatment programs is a major advantage over traditional inpatient treatments and residential treatment programs  which typically consist of approximately to days of combined inpatient detoxification and recovery in a rehabilitation or residential treatment center 
the prometa treatment programs do not require an extensive stay at an inpatient facility 
rather  the treatment programs offer the convenience of a three day treatment addictive stimulants require a second two day treatment three weeks later and can generally be administered on an outpatient basis 
this is particularly relevant since approximately of adults classified with dependence or abuse are employed  and loss of time from work can be a major deterrent for seeking treatment 
moreover  we believe the prometa treatment programs can be used at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement other forms of alcohol and drug abuse treatments 
as such  our treatment programs offer a potentially valuable alternative or addition to traditional behavioral or pharmacotherapy treatments 
treatment medications there are currently no generally accepted medical treatments for methamphetamine dependence 
anti depressants and dopamine agonists have been investigated as possible maintenance therapies  but none have been fda approved or are generally accepted for medical practice 
several classes of pharmaceutical agents have been investigated as potential maintenance agents eg  anti depressants and dopamine agonists for cocaine dependence  however  none are fda approved for treatment of cocaine dependence or widely generally accepted in medical practice 
their effects are variable in terms of providing symptomatic relief  and many of the agents may cause side effects or may not be well tolerated by patients 
there are a number of companies developing or marketing medications for reducing craving in the treatment of alcoholism 
these include the addiction medication naltrexone  an opiate receptor antagonist  is marketed by a number of generic pharmaceutical companies as well as under the trade name revia  for treatment of alcohol dependence  vivitrol  an extended release formulation of naltrexone manufactured by alkermes  is intended to be administered by a physician via monthly injections for the treatment of alcohol dependence in patients who are able to abstain from drinking in an outpatient setting and are not actively drinking prior to treatment initiation 
alkermes reported that in clinical trials  when used in combination with psychosocial support  vivitrol was shown to reduce the number of drinking days and heavy drinking days and to prolong abstinence in patients who abstained from alcohol the week prior to starting treatment  campral delayed release tablets acamprosate calcium  an nmda receptor antagonist taken two to three times per day on a chronic or long term basis and marketed by forest laboratories 
clinical 
table of contents studies supported the effectiveness in the maintenance of abstinence for alcohol dependent patients who had undergone inpatient detoxification and were already abstinent from alcohol  topiramate topamax  a drug manufactured by ortho mcneill jannssen  which is approved for the treatment of seizures 
a multi site clinical trial reported in october found that topiramate significantly reduced heavy drinking days in alcohol dependent individuals 
many medications marketed to treat alcohol or drug dependence are not administered until the patient is already abstinent  require long term chronic administration and or must be taken several times a day to achieve the desired effect 
as noted above  we believe the prometa treatment programs represent an integrated approach to treatment that includes medical  nutritional and psychosocial components that can be used at various stages of recovery  including initiation of abstinence and during early recovery  and can complement other existing treatments 
as such  our treatment programs offer a potentially valuable addition to traditional medical treatment 
moreover  because treatment with the prometa treatment programs is an integrated treatment  we do not view the current medical therapies as directly competitive and in some cases may be used in conjunction with our treatment programs 
we also believe  based on the limited initial results discussed above  that treatment using our treatment programs may have higher completion rates  greater compliance  reduction or elimination of cravings  improved cognitive functioning and potentially lower relapse rates 
behavioral health managed care services the behavioral healthcare industry is very competitive and provides products and services that are price sensitive 
we believe that there are approximately managed behavioral healthcare organizations mbhos providing services for an estimated million covered lives in the united states 
compcare s competitors include both freestanding mbhos as well as hmos with internal behavioral health units or subsidiaries 
many of these competitors have revenues  financial resources  and membership substantially larger than compcare 
the extent of competition results in significant pricing pressures which limits compcare s revenue growth 
accordingly  we expect compcare s future growth to come mainly from additional contracts 
in addition to mbhos  there are disease management companies that may offer services or programs that will compete with our disease management products 
we believe  however  that because our disease management programs are built around our proprietary  patented prometa treatment programs  no other company  mbho or healthcare provider will be able to directly compete with our disease management product offering 
development of our technology much of our proprietary  patented and patent pending  substance dependence technology known as the prometa treatment program  was developed by dr

legarda identified some of the adverse physical effects of substance abuse on the brain and began to develop technologies that specifically focused on the neurochemistry of the brain as a core part of addictive behavior modification 
in  dr 
legarda filed patent cooperation treaty pct applications in spain to protect treatment programs that he developed for dependencies to alcohol and cocaine 
we acquired the rights to these patent filings in march through a technology purchase and license agreement with dr 
legarda s company  tratamientos avanzados de la adiccion sl  to which we pay a royalty of three percent of the amount the patient pays for treatment using our treatment programs 
after acquiring these rights  we filed us patent applications and other national phase patent applications based on the pct filings  as well as provisional us patent applications to protect aspects of additional treatment programs for alcohol  cocaine and other addictive stimulants 
we have two issued us patents  one relating to the treatment of cocaine dependency with our prometa treatment program and one relating to our prometa treatment program for the treatment of certain symptoms associated with alcohol 
we have also received allowances  issuances or notices that patent grants are intended for our core intellectually property for the treatment of alcohol and or stimulant dependence in mexico  australia  new zealand  singapore  south africa  russia  ukraine  south korea  china and the european union 

table of contents once patents are issued  they generally will expire years from the dates of original filing 
our two issued us patents will expire in proprietary rights and licensing our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology 
to help ensure compliance with our license joint venture agreements  we employ site managers in each of our major markets 
our branded trade names include the following hythiam prometa prometa center catasys the science of recovery we impose restrictions in our license agreements on our customers rights to utilize and disclose our technology 
we also seek to protect our intellectual property by generally requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements and by restricting access to our proprietary information 
we require that  as a condition of their employment  employees assign to us their interests in inventions  original works of authorship  copyrights and similar intellectual property rights conceived or developed by them during their employment with us

our behavioral health managed care services segment focuses on providing managed care services in the behavioral health  psychiatric and substance abuse fields  and principally includes the operations of our majority owned  controlled subsidiary  compcare 
a majority of our consolidated revenues and assets are earned or located within the united states 
employees as of december   we and our consolidated managed treatment centers employed approximately persons 
in january we significantly reduced the number of employees in connection with streamlining our operations to focus on disease management and managed care  and we currently employ approximately persons

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information in this report  including the risk factors listed below 
risks and uncertainties in addition to those we describe below  that may not be presently known to us  or that we currently believe are immaterial  may also harm our business and operations 
if any of these risks occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline  and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history  and expect to continue to incur operating losses  making it difficult to evaluate our future prospects we have been unprofitable since our inception in and expect to continue to incur substantial additional operating losses and negative cash flow from operations for at least the next twelve months 
while we currently estimate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next two years or until we achieve positive cash flows  there can be no assurance this will be the case 
if cash reserves are insufficient to sustain us to profitability  our ability to meet our obligations as they become due may depend on our ability to delay or reduce operating expenses  sell additional securities  borrow funds or some combination thereof 
we may seek additional funding through public or private financing or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners 
we may also seek to raise additional capital through public or private financing in order to increase the amount of our cash reserves on hand 
we may not be successful in raising necessary funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
if this occurs  we may be unable to meet our cash obligations as they become due and we may be required to delay or reduce operating expenses and curtail our operations  which would have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  because of the significant publicly held minority interest in compcare  we do not anticipate receiving dividends from compcare or otherwise having access to cash flows generated by compcare s business 
although we do not anticipate advancing any funds to compcare to fund its operations  you also should assume that we will not have access to cash generated by compcare to fund the growth of our prometa based business 
we may fail to successfully manage and maintain the growth of our business  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and business continued expansion could put significant strain on our management  operational and financial resources 
the need to comply with the rules and regulations of the sec and the nasdaq global market will continue to 
table of contents place significant demands on our financial and accounting staff  financial  accounting and information systems  and our internal controls and procedures  any of which may not be adequate to support our anticipated growth 
we may not be able to effectively hire  train  retain  motivate and manage required personnel 
our failure to manage growth effectively could limit our ability to satisfy our reporting obligations  or achieve our marketing  commercialization and financial goals 
in january we acquired a controlling equity interest in compcare  a publicly traded company  and our ability to oversee this business  which is a new business for us and one with which we have had little previous experience  may significantly exacerbate the strain on our resources 
we may need additional funding  and we cannot guarantee that we will find adequate sources of capital in the future 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since inception and have expended  and expect to continue to expend  substantial funds to grow our business 
although we currently estimate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months  we cannot assure you that we will not require additional funds before we achieve positive cash flows 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may not be sufficient to fund our business until we can become cash flow positive and we may never become cash flow positive 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  such financing will result in further dilution to our stockholders 
any equity securities issued also may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional debt securities  these debt securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our technology or products  or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms when needed 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on commercially acceptable terms  we may need to downsize or halt our operations and may be unable to continue developing our products 
our investments in adjustable rate securities are subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 
as of december   approximately million of our marketable securities consisted of auction rate securities  which are variable rate instruments with longer stated maturities whose interest rates are reset at predetermined short term intervals through a dutch auction system 
through february   all of our auction rate securities held at december  had completed at least one auction successfully through the normal auction process  and we had reduced our total investments in auction rate securities to million 
however  from february through march   auctions for these securities had failed  meaning the parties desiring to sell securities could not be matched with an adequate number of buyers  resulting in our having to continue to hold these securities 
although the securities are aaa aaa rated and collateralized by portfolios of student loans guaranteed by the us government  based on current market conditions it is likely that auctions will continue to be unsuccessful  limiting the short term liquidity of these investments until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future record an impairment charge on these investments 
in addition  these types of developments could cause us to reclassify our investments in auction rate securities from a current asset to a long term asset 
while we currently believe we will be able to liquidate our investment without significant loss within the next year and that these securities are not significantly impaired due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
although we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan  based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  there can be no assurance this will be the case 

table of contents our treatment programs may not be as effective as we believe them to be  which could limit our revenues and adversely affect our business our belief in the efficacy of our prometa treatment programs is based on a limited number of studies and commercial pilots that have been conducted to date  and our initial experience with a relatively small number of patients 
such results may not be statistically significant  have not been subjected to close scientific scrutiny  and may not be indicative of the long term future performance and safety of treatment with our programs 
controlled scientific studies  including those that have been announced and planned for the future  may yield results that are unfavorable or demonstrate that treatment with our programs is not clinically effective or safe 
if the initially indicated results cannot be successfully replicated or maintained over time  utilization of our programs could decline substantially 
our prometa treatment programs may not become widely accepted  which could limit our growth further marketplace acceptance of our treatment programs may largely depend upon healthcare providers and third party payers interpretation of our limited data  the results of pending studies  or upon reviews and reports that may be given by independent researchers 
in the event such research does not establish our treatment programs to be safe and effective  it is unlikely we will be able to achieve widespread market acceptance 
disappointing results for our prometa treatment programs  or failure to attain our publicly disclosed milestones  could adversely affect market acceptance and have a material adverse effect on our stock price there are a number of studies  evaluations and pilot programs currently in progress that are evaluating our prometa treatment programs  and we expect results of many to become available throughout the remainder of and during disappointing results or termination of evaluations or pilot programs could have a material adverse effect on the commercial acceptance of the prometa treatment programs and on our results of operations 
in addition  announcements regarding results  or anticipation of results  may increase volatility in our stock price 
on october   the pierce county council in the state of washington voted to end funding for prometa 
this announcement had an immediate negative effect on our stock price  and we are unable to assess the longer term impact on our business 
in addition to numerous upcoming milestones  from time to time we provide financial guidance and other forecasts to the market 
while we believe that the assumptions underlying projections and forecasts we make publicly available are reasonable  projections and forecasts are inherently subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
any failure to achieve milestones  or to do so in a timely manner  or to achieve publicly announced guidance and forecasts  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the price of our common stock 
our industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully the healthcare business in general  and the substance dependence treatment business in particular  are highly competitive 
we compete with many types of substance dependence treatment methods  treatment facilities and other service providers  many of whom are more established and better funded than we are 
many of these other treatment methods and facilities are well established in the same markets we target  have substantial sales volume  and are provided and marketed by companies with much greater financial resources  facilities  organization  reputation and experience than we have 
the historical focus on the use of psychological or behavioral therapies  as opposed to medical or physiological treatments for substance dependence  may create further resistance to penetrating the substance dependence treatment market 
there are a number of companies developing or marketing medications for reducing craving in the treatment of alcoholism  including the addiction medication naltrexone  an opiate receptor antagonist  is marketed by a number of generic pharmaceutical companies as well as under the trade name revia  for treatment of alcohol dependence  vivitrol  an extended release formulation of naltrexone manufactured by alkermes  is intended to be administered by a physician via monthly injections for the treatment of alcohol dependence in 
table of contents patients who are able to abstain from drinking in an outpatient setting and are not actively drinking prior to treatment initiation 
alkermes reported that in clinical trials  when used in combination with psychosocial support  vivitrol was shown to reduce the number of drinking days and heavy drinking days and to prolong abstinence in patients who abstained from alcohol the week prior to starting treatment  campral delayed release tablets acamprosate calcium  an nmda receptor antagonist taken two to three times per day on a chronic or long term basis and marketed by forest laboratories 
clinical studies supported the effectiveness in the maintenance of abstinence for alcohol dependent patients who had undergone inpatient detoxification and were already abstinent from alcohol  topiramate topamax  a drug manufactured by ortho mcneill jannssen  which is approved for the treatment of seizures 
a multi site clinical trial reported in october found that tropiramate significantly reduced heavy drinking days in alcohol dependent individuals 
our competitors may develop and introduce new processes and products that are equal or superior to our programs in treating alcohol and substance dependencies 
accordingly  we may be adversely affected by any new processes and technology developed by our competitors 
there are approximately  facilities reporting to the substance abuse and mental health services administration that provide substance abuse treatment on an inpatient or outpatient basis 
well known examples of residential treatment programs include the betty ford center  caron foundation  hazelden and sierra tucson 
in addition  individual physicians may provide substance dependence treatment in the course of their practices 
we depend on key personnel  the loss of which could impact the ability to manage our business our future success depends on the performance of our senior management  in particular our chairman and chief executive officer  terren s 
peizer  senior executive vice presidents  richard a 
anderson  anthony lamacchia and christopher s 
hassan and chief financial officer  chuck timpe 
messrs 
peizer  hassan and anderson each is party to an employment agreement which  subject to termination for cause or good reason  has a remaining term of approximately six  two and one years  respectively 
messrs 
timpe and lamacchia do not have employment contracts 
compcare s operations are highly dependent on the efforts of its senior management  in particular its president and chief executive officer  john m 
hill  and chief financial officer  robert j 
landis 
each is party to an employment agreement which  subject to termination for cause or good reason  has a remaining term of approximately three years and eighteen months  respectively 
the loss of the services of mr 
peizer or any other key member of management could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business 
we are subject to litigation  which could result in substantial liabilities that may exceed our insurance coverage all significant medical treatments and procedures  including treatment utilizing our programs  involve the risk of serious injury or death 
even under proper medical supervision  withdrawal from alcohol may cause severe physical reactions 
while we have not been the subject of any such claims  our business entails an inherent risk of claims for personal injuries and substantial damage awards 
we cannot control whether individual physicians will apply the appropriate standard of care  or conform to our treatment programs in determining how to treat their patients 
while our agreements typically require physicians to indemnify us for their negligence  there can be no assurance they will be willing and financially able to do so if claims are made 
in addition  our license agreements require us to indemnify physicians  hospitals or their affiliates for losses resulting from our negligence 
compcare is subject to lawsuits and claims of professional liability alleging negligence in performing utilization review and other managed care activities  and in the denial of payment for services 
such incidents may 
table of contents result in professional negligence or other claims against compcare causing it to incur fees and expend substantial resources in defense of such actions 
we currently have insurance coverage for up to million per year  in the aggregate  for personal injury claims 
hythiam and compcare maintain directors and officers liability insurance coverage  subject to a  per claim self insured retention 
compcare maintains a program of insurance coverage against a broad range of risks related to its business  subject to deductibles and self insured retentions 
we may not be able to maintain adequate liability insurance at acceptable costs or on favorable terms 
we expect that liability insurance will be more difficult to obtain and that premiums will increase over time and as the volume of patients treated with our programs increases 
in the event of litigation  we may sustain significant damages or settlement expense regardless of a claim s merit  litigation expense and significant harm to our reputation 
if government and third party payers fail to provide coverage and adequate payment rates for treatment using our treatment programs  our revenue and prospects for profitability will be harmed our future revenue growth will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement for treatment using our programs from third party payers such as government health programs including medicare and medicaid  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
to date  we have received an insignificant amount of revenue from our prometa treatment programs from governmental payers  managed care organizations and other third party payers  and acceptance of our prometa treatment programs is important to the future prospects of our business 
in addition  third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs  and may not cover or provide adequate payment for treatment using our programs 
adequate third party reimbursement might not be available to enable us to realize an appropriate return on investment in research and product development  and the lack of such reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
our international operations may be subject to foreign regulation  and the success of our foreign operations will depend on many factors the criteria of foreign laws  regulations and requirements are often vague and subject to change and interpretation 
our international operations may become the subject of foreign regulatory  civil  criminal or other investigations or proceedings  and our interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s time and attention  regardless of whether it ultimately is successful 
if we fail to comply with any applicable international laws  or a determination is made that we have failed to comply with these laws  our financial condition and results of operations  including our domestic operations  could be adversely affected 
in addition  the private pay healthcare system in europe is not as developed as in the u 
s and as a result it may be more difficult to convince patients in these countries to pay substantial amounts for treatment 
we will be reliant on relationships that we establish with local companies  thought leaders and governments 
there can be no assurance we will be able to establish these relationships  maintain them or that the partners will retain their influence in the market 
it may take longer than we expect to commence operations or to operate our business at profitable levels as we do not have the established relationships and or knowledge of the regulations and business practices in the markets we are in or entering 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards nols of approximately million for federal income tax purposes that will begin to expire in these nols may be used to offset future taxable income  to the extent we generate any taxable income  and thereby reduce or eliminate our future federal income taxes otherwise payable 
section of the internal revenue code imposes limitations on a corporation s ability to utilize nols if it experiences an ownership change as defined in section in general terms  an ownership change may result from transactions increasing the ownership of certain stockholders in the stock of a corporation by more than percent over a three year period 
in the event that an ownership change has occurred  or were to occur  utilization of our nols would be subject to an annual limitation under section determined by multiplying the value of our stock 
table of contents at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate as defined in the internal revenue code 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years 
we may be found to have experienced an ownership change under section as a result of events in the past or the issuance of shares of common stock upon a conversion of notes  or a combination thereof 
if so  the use of our nols  or a portion thereof  against our future taxable income may be subject to an annual limitation under section  which may result in expiration of a portion of our nols before utilization 
risks related to our acquisition of compcare we may not realize the expected benefits of the compcare acquisition  and may not be able to successfully utilize compcare s infrastructure we may not be successful in realizing the expected benefits of our license agreement with comprehensive care corporation or the recent acquisition of a majority controlling interest in compcare 
achieving the benefits of our relationship with compcare will depend in part on our ability to successfully utilize compcare s infrastructure and integrating with the benefits of its operations and personnel in a timely and efficient manner 
the process will divert management time and attention from our other business  and require the effective coordination of personnel  systems  applications  policies  procedures  business processes and operations 
this  too  will be difficult  unpredictable  and subject to delay because of possible cultural conflicts and different opinions on technical decisions and business strategy 
compcare is engaged in a business with which we have little experience  and this may present additional challenges to us 
further  we may be unable to realize synergies between our prometa business and compcare s managed behavioral healthcare business 
compcare may be unable to retain its key management  technical  sales and customer support personnel 
if we cannot successfully coordinate our operations and personnel  we will not realize the expected benefits of our relationship 
in addition  because of the significant publicly held minority interest in compcare  we may be unable to gain access to the cash flows for compcare and may be unable to realize the same level of benefits that we might be able to realize if compcare were a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
there may be ongoing legal challenges to our relationship with compcare  which could adversely affect our results of operations on may   we entered into a termination agreement with compcare terminating a proposed merger with compcare and the acquisition of the remaining common stock of compcare 
there are potential legal and economic risks associated with terminating the merger agreement and continuing with our ongoing relationship as compcare s majority controlling shareholder  including challenges from public minority shareholders concerning the procedural and financial fairness of our existing agreements  and any future agreements or arrangement between us 
current or future litigation may be expensive and time consuming  and may impede or restrict our ability to operate effectively  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
risks related to compcare s business compcare may not be able to accurately predict utilization of its full risk contracts resulting in contracts priced at levels insufficient to ensure profitability compcare s managed care operations are at risk for costs incurred to provide agreed upon levels of service 
failure to anticipate or control costs could have material  adverse effects on compcare s business 
a very large percentage of compcare s services are provided on a full risk capitation basis which exposes compcare to significant risk that contracts negotiated and entered into may ultimately be unprofitable if utilization levels require it to provide services at a cost in excess of the capitation rates compcare receives for the services 
the population compcare began managing in for its large indiana client had not been subject to managed care previously and consequently there was little historical utilization data upon which to base initial pricing 
actual utilization experience has been greater than initial estimates  resulting in higher claim costs and lower profit margins 
failure to manage its costs or achieve anticipated cost reductions in populations brought under management would have an adverse effect on compcare s financial results 

table of contents compcare may be unsuccessful in profitably managing its new indiana medicaid contract  and may not be able to meet specified performance measures that would allow it to receive an increase in the rate compcare may be unsuccessful in managing its new indiana medicaid contract that started january   which provided over of its operating revenues in providing services under a new contract for populations at risk that have not been managed before exposes compcare to the risk it may be unprofitable 
there is a limited historical basis for the actuarial assumptions about the utilization of benefits by members covered under this new managed care behavioral program  and premiums based on these assumptions may be insufficient to cover the benefits provided and compcare may be unable to obtain offsetting rate increases 
contract premiums have been set based on anticipated significant savings and on types of utilization management that may not be possible  may cause disagreements with providers and divert management resources  which would have an adverse impact on compcare s financial results 
claims expense equaled revenues for this contract for the year ended december  compcare is negotiating and believes it will receive a rate increase effective january   provided it complies with monthly performance measures it believes it will meet 
although compcare believes it will meet these standards  any failure to comply with one or more of the measurement criteria will reduce compcare s anticipated cash flow and profitability from this contract 
compcare s existing and potential managed care clients operate in a highly competitive environment and may be subject to a higher rate of merger  acquisition and regulation than in other industries compcare typically contracts with small to medium sized hmos which may be adversely affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means 
its clients may also determine to manage the behavioral healthcare benefits in house and  as a result  discontinue contracting with compcare 
additionally  its clients may be acquired by larger hmos  in which case there can be no assurance that the acquiring company would renew its contract 
many of compcare s managed care company clients provide services to groups covered by medicare  medicaid or children s health insurance program chip plans susceptible to annual changes in reimbursement rates and eligibility requirements that could ultimately affect compcare as of december   compcare managed over  lives in connection with behavioral and substance abuse services covered through medicaid and chip programs in texas  medicare and medicaid in florida  medicaid in california  indiana and michigan  and medicare in maryland and pennsylvania 
any changes in medicare  medicaid and or chip reimbursement could adversely affect compcare through contract bidding and cost structures with the health plans impacted by such changes 
temporary reductions have previously had a negative impact on compcare  and if implemented in the future could have a material  adverse impact on its operations 
in addition  states in which compcare operates may pass legislation that would reduce its revenue through changes in the reimbursement rates or in the number of eligible participants 
compcare may be unable to reduce its costs to a level that would allow it to maintain current gross margins specific to its medicare  medicaid and chip programs 
compcare is dependent on its provider network to provide services to its members compcare contracts with providers as a means to assure access to behavioral health services for its members 
some providers could refuse to contract with compcare  demand higher payments  or take other actions which could result in higher healthcare operating expenses 
in addition  certain providers may have significant market position  which could cause disruption to provider access in a particular geographic area for compcare s members and affect its contractual requirements with its customers of maintaining an adequate network 
because providers are responsible for claims submission  the timing of which is uncertain  compcare must estimate the amount of claims incurred but not reported  and actual results may differ materially compcare s costs of care include estimated amounts for claims incurred but not reported ibnr 
the ibnr is estimated using an actuarial paid completion factor methodology and other statistical analyses that it 
table of contents continually reviews and adjusts  if necessary  to reflect any change in the estimated liability 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in utilization and other factors 
compcare s estimates of ibnr may be inadequate  which would negatively affect results of operations 
considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  its unpaid claims liability may be inadequate  and actual results may differ materially from the estimates reported 
compcare is dependent on a limited number of customers  and loss or reduction in business of any one could have a material adverse effect on working capital and results of operations for the year ended december  compcare provide behavioral healthcare services to the members of six health plans under contracts that on a combined basis represented approximately of compcare s operating revenue 
the terms of each contract are generally for one year periods and are automatically renewable for additional one year periods unless terminated by either party by giving the requisite written notice 
the loss of one or more of these clients  unless replaced by new business  would negatively affect the financial condition of compcare 
in the past  compcare has experienced the loss of major customers 
compcare may be unsuccessful in obtaining performance bonds or other security that is required by its existing or future clients  and consequently may lose clients compcare s new indiana client requires compcare to maintain a performance bond in the amount of  in addition  certain of compcare s other customers may require restricted cash accounts or other security with respect to its obligations to pay ibnr claims and claims not yet processed and paid 
due to compcare s small size and financial condition  it may be unable to provide the security required by its client  which could result in the loss of a client or clients which would negatively affect compcare s financial condition 
compcare s industry is subject to diverse licensure requirements varying by state  and regulation changes could adversely affect contract profitability and ability to gain and retain clients compcare is required to hold licenses or certificates to perform utilization review and third party administrator tpa services in certain states in which it does business 
additional utilization review or tpa licenses may be required in the future and compcare may not qualify to obtain them 
in many states  entities that assume risk under contract with licensed insurance companies or health plans have not been considered by state regulators to be conducting an insurance or hmo business 
as a result  compcare has not sought licensure as either an insurer or hmo in any state 
if the regulatory positions of these states were to change  its business could be materially affected until such time as it is able to meet the regulatory requirements  if at all 
additionally  some states may determine to contract directly with companies such as compcare for managed behavioral healthcare services in which case they may also require it to maintain financial reserves or net worth requirements that it may not be able to meet 
currently  compcare cannot quantify the potential effects of additional regulation of the managed care industry  but such costs will have an adverse effect on compcare s future operations to the extent that they are not able to be recouped in future managed care contracts 
compcare is subject to existing clients issuing rfps for the management of behavioral services currently being managed compcare s clients are aware of the highly competitive nature of the industry  and its contracts with them frequently contain provisions allowing termination of the contract by either party without cause with days written notice 
consequently compcare s clients may request from compcare and any of its competitors a request for proposal rfp for behavioral services currently managed by compcare  putting compcare at risk of losing a client or clients 
for example  during a major texas client issued an rfp prior to the end of compcare s contract 
compcare submitted a proposal but were not chosen to continue services  resulting in a significant reduction in revenue 
in addition  certain administrative and overhead costs continued to be incurred past the termination date 
compcare is subject to intense competition that may prevent it from gaining new customers or pricing its contracts at levels to achieve sufficient gross margins to ensure profitability compcare is continually pursuing new business 
however  many of compcare s competitors are significantly larger and better capitalized than compcare and the smaller size and financial condition of compcare 
table of contents has proved a deterrent to some prospective customers 
additionally  compcare will likely have difficulty in matching the financial resources expended on marketing by its competitors 
as a result  compcare may not be able to successfully compete in its industry 
compcare s major competitors include magellan health services  united behavioral health  valueoptions  and aps healthcare 
compcare s sales cycle is long  which complicates its ability to predict its growth 
the sales and implementation process of compcare s services is lengthy and requires compcare s potential clients to commit time and other resources 
compcare s sales cycle is unpredictable and has generally ranged from to months from initial contact to an executed contract 
accordingly  it may be difficult to replace any lost business quickly 
a failure of compcare s information systems would significantly impair its ability to serve its customers and manage its business 
an effective and secure information system  available at all times  is vital to compcare s health plan customers and their members 
compcare depends on its computer systems for significant service and management functions  such as providing membership verification  monitoring utilization  processing provider claims  and providing regulatory data and other client and managerial reports 
although compcare s computer and communications hardware is protected by physical and software safeguards  it is still vulnerable to computer viruses  fire  storm  flood  power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins and similar events 
compcare does not have redundancy for all of its computer and telecommunications facilities 
a catastrophic event could have a significant negative effect on compcare s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
compcare also depends on a third party provider of application services for its core business application 
any sustained disruption in their services to us would have a material effect on our business 
compcare is subject to fines and penalties being assessed by its clients many of compcare s contracts contain provisions stating that if its clients are assessed penalties or fines by a regulatory agency due to compcare s noncompliance with a contractual requirement  compcare will be responsible for paying the assessed fine or penalty 
though to date  no material fines have been assessed under such provisions  any future fines would have a negative impact on results of operations 
compcare may be unsuccessful in renewing its ncqa accreditation and may lose customers who require such accreditation ncqa accreditation is required by several of compcare s client contracts and is an important consideration to its prospective clients 
compcare is periodically evaluated by ncqa to validate the company s adherence to ncqa industry accepted standards covering operational areas such as preventative care  utilization management  credentialing  member rights and responsibilities  and quality improvement 
maintaining these quality standards and the ncqa accreditation are important considerations of our customers and prospective clients who are evaluated against similar standards 
if compcare is not successful in renewing its ncqa accreditation  this could result in the loss of a client or clients which would negatively affect compcare s financial condition 
risks related to our intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect the proprietary prometa treatment programs which are the core of our business we consider the protection of our proprietary prometa treatment programs to be critical to our business prospects 
we obtained the rights to some of our most significant prometa technologies through an agreement that is subject to a number of conditions and restrictions  and a breach or termination of that agreement or the bankruptcy of any party to that agreement could significantly impact our ability to use and develop our technologies 
while we have two issued us patents  one relating to the treatment of cocaine dependency with our prometa treatment program and one relating to our prometa treatment program for the treatment of certain symptoms associated with alcohol dependency  we currently have no issued us patents covering our prometa treatment program for the treatment of methamphetamine dependency 
the patent applications we have licensed or filed may not issue as patents  and any issued patents may be too narrow in scope to provide us with a competitive advantage 
our patent position is uncertain and includes complex factual and legal issues  including the existence of prior art that may preclude or limit the scope of patent protection 
issued patents will generally expire twenty years after their priority date 
our two issued us patents will expire in further  our patents and pending applications for patents and other intellectual property have been pledged as collateral to secure our obligations to pay certain debts  and our default with respect to those obligations could result in the transfer of our patents to our creditor 
in the event of such a transfer  we may be unable to continue to operate our business 
patent examiners may reject our patent applications and thereby prevent us from receiving more patents 
competitors  licensees and others may challenge our patents and  if successful  our patents may be denied  subjected to reexamination  rendered unenforceable  or invalidated 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents  and to protect and prevent infringement can be substantial 
we may not be able to adequately protect the aspects of our treatment programs that are not patented or have only limited patent protection 
furthermore  competitors and others may independently develop similar or more advanced treatment programs and technologies  may design around aspects of our technology  or may discover or duplicate our trade secrets and proprietary methods 
to the extent we utilize processes and technology that constitute trade secrets under applicable laws  we must implement appropriate levels of security to ensure protection of such laws  which we may not do effectively 
policing compliance with our confidentiality agreements and unauthorized use of our technology is difficult 
in addition  the laws of many foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the united 
table of contents states 
the loss of any of our trade secrets or proprietary rights which may be protected under the foregoing intellectual property safeguards may result in the loss of our competitive advantage over present and potential competitors 
our intellectual property may not prove to be an effective barrier to competition  in which case our business could be materially adversely affected 
our pending patent applications disclose and claim various approaches to the use of the prometa treatment program 
there is no assurance that we will receive one or more patents from these pending applications  or that  even if we receive one or more patents  the patent claims will be sufficiently broad to create patent infringement liability for competitors using treatment programs similar to the prometa treatment programs 
confidentiality agreements with employees  licensees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes  we rely in part on confidentiality provisions in our agreements with employees  licensees  treating physicians and others 
these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information 
costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights  and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
we have had three instances in which it was necessary to send a formal demand to cease and desist using our programs to treat patients due to breach of confidentiality provisions in our agreements  and in one instance have had to file suit to enforce these provisions 
we may be subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others  and unfavorable outcomes could harm our business our future operations may be subject to claims  and potential litigation  arising from our alleged infringement of patents  trade secrets or copyrights owned by other third parties 
within the healthcare  drug and bio technology industry  many companies actively pursue infringement claims and litigation  which makes the entry of competitive products more difficult 
we may experience claims or litigation initiated by existing  better funded competitors and by other third parties 
court ordered injunctions may prevent us from continuing to market existing products or from bringing new products to market and the outcome of litigation and any resulting loss of revenues and expenses of litigation may substantially affect our ability to meet our expenses and continue operations 
risks related to our industry our policies and procedures may not fully comply with complex and increasing regulation by state and federal authorities  which could negatively impact our business operations our prometa treatment programs have not been approved by the food and drug administration fda  and while the drugs incorporated in the prometa treatment program have been approved for other indications  they are not fda approved for the treatment of alcohol or substance dependency 
we have not sought  and do not currently intend to seek  fda approval for the prometa treatment program 
it is possible that in the future the fda could require us to seek fda approval for the prometa treatment program 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and continues to undergo significant changes as third party payers  such as medicare and medicaid  traditional indemnity insurers  managed care organizations and other private payers increase efforts to control cost  utilization and delivery of healthcare services 
healthcare companies are subject to extensive and complex federal  state and local laws  regulations and judicial decisions 
the us congress and state legislatures are considering legislation that could limit funding to our licensees and compcare s clients 
in addition  the fda regulates development  testing  labeling  manufacturing  marketing  promotion  distribution  record keeping and reporting requirements for prescription drugs  medical devices and biologics 
other regulatory requirements apply to dietary supplements  including vitamins 
compliance with laws and regulations enforced by regulatory agencies who have broad discretion in applying them may be required for our programs or other medical programs or services developed or used by us 
many healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our business are complex  applied broadly and subject to interpretation by courts and government agencies 
regulatory  political and 
table of contents legal action and pricing pressures could prevent us from marketing some or all of our products and services for a period of time or permanently 
our failure  or the failure of our licensees  to comply with applicable regulations may result in the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions that we cannot afford  or require redesign or withdrawal of our programs from the market 
we may be subject to regulatory  enforcement and investigative proceedings  which could adversely affect our financial condition or operations we could become the subject of regulatory  enforcement  or other investigations or proceedings  and our relationships  business structure  and interpretations of applicable laws and regulations may be challenged 
the defense of any such challenge could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s time and attention 
in addition  any such challenges could require significant changes to how we conduct our business 
any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our business  regardless of whether it ultimately is successful 
if determination is made that we have failed to comply with any applicable laws  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the promotion of our treatment programs may be found to violate federal law concerning off label uses of prescription drugs  which could prevent us from marketing our programs generally  the food  drug  and cosmetic fdc act  requires that a prescription drug be approved by fda for a specific indication before the product can be distributed in interstate commerce 
although the fdc act does not prohibit a doctor s use of a drug for another indication this is referred to as off label use  it does prohibit the promotion of a drug product for an unapproved use 
fda also permits the non promotional discussion of information related to off label use in the context of scientific or medical communications 
our treatment programs include the use of prescription drugs that have been approved by fda  but not for the treatment of chemical dependence and drug addiction  which is how the drugs are used in our programs 
although we carefully structure our communications in a way that is intended to comply with the fdc act and fda regulations  it is possible that our actions could be found to violate the prohibition on off label promotion of drugs 
in addition  the fdc act imposes limits on the types of claims that may be made for a dietary supplement  and the promotion of a dietary supplement beyond such claims may also be seen as the unlawful promotion of a drug product for an unapproved use 
because our treatment programs also include the use of nutritional supplements  it is possible that claims made for those products could also put us at risk of fda enforcement for making unlawful claims 
violations of the fdc act or fda regulations can result in a range of sanctions  including administrative actions by fda such as issuance of a warning letter  seizure of product  issuance of an injunction prohibiting future violations  and imposition of criminal or civil penalties 
a successful enforcement action could prevent promotion of our treatment programs and we may be unable to continue operating under our current business model 
even if we defeat an enforcement action  the expenses associated with doing so  as well as the negative publicity concerning the off label use of drugs in our treatment programs  could adversely affect our business and results of operation 
the fda has recently increased enforcement efforts in the area of promotion of off label use of drugs  and we cannot assure you that our business practices or third party clinical trials will not come under scrutiny 
treatment using our programs may be found to require fda or other review or approval  which could delay or prevent the study or use of our treatment programs under authority of the fdc act  fda extensively regulates entities and individuals engaged in the conduct of clinical trials  which broadly includes experiments in which a drug is administered to humans 
fda regulations require  among other things  submission of a clinical trial treatment program for fda review  obtaining from the agency an investigational new drug ind exemption before initiating a clinical trial  obtaining appropriate informed consent from study subjects  having the study approved and subject to continuing review by an institutional review board irb  and reporting to fda safety information regarding the conduct of the trial 
certain third parties have engaged or are engaging in the use of our treatment program and the collection of outcomes data in ways that may be considered to constitute a clinical trial  and that may be subject to fda regulations and require irb approval and oversight 
in addition  it is possible that use of our treatment program by individual physicians in treating their patients may be found to constitute a clinical trial or investigation that requires irb review or submission of an ind 
table of contents or is otherwise subject to regulation by fda 
fda has authority to inspect clinical investigation sites and irbs  and to take action with regard to any violations 
violations of fda regulations regarding clinical trials can result in a range of actions  including suspension of the trial  prohibiting the clinical investigator from ever participating in clinical trials  and criminal prosecution 
individual hospitals and physicians may also submit their use of our treatment programs to their irbs  which may prohibit or place restrictions on it 
fda enforcement actions or irb restrictions could adversely affect our business and the ability of our customers to use our treatment programs 
the fda has recently increased enforcement efforts regarding clinical trials  and we cannot assure you that the activities of our customers or others using our treatment programs will not come under scrutiny 
failure to comply with ftc or similar state laws could result in sanctions or limit the claims we can make our promotional activities and materials  including advertising to consumers and professionals  and materials provided to licensees for their use in promoting our treatment programs  are regulated by the federal trade commission ftc under the ftc act  which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices  including claims which are false  misleading or inadequately substantiated 
the ftc typically requires competent and reliable scientific tests or studies to substantiate express or implied claims that a product or service is safe or effective 
if the ftc were to interpret our promotional materials as making express or implied claims that our treatment programs are safe or effective for the treatment of alcohol  cocaine or methamphetamine addiction  or any other claims  it may find that we do not have adequate substantiation for such claims 
allegations of a failure to comply with the ftc act or similar laws enforced by state attorneys general and other state and local officials could result in administrative or judicial orders limiting or eliminating the claims we can make about our treatment programs  and other sanctions including substantial financial penalties 
our business practices may be found to constitute illegal fee splitting or corporate practice of medicine  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business many states  including california in which our principal executive offices and one of our managed treatment centers is located  have laws that prohibit business corporations  such as us  from practicing medicine  exercising control over medical judgments or decisions of physicians  or engaging in arrangements with physicians such as employment  payment for referrals or fee splitting 
courts  regulatory authorities or other parties  including physicians  may assert that we are engaged in the unlawful corporate practice of medicine by providing administrative and other services in connection with our treatment programs or by consolidating the revenues of the physician practices we manage  or that licensing our technology for a license fee that could be characterized as a portion of the patient fees  or subleasing space and providing turn key business management to affiliated medical groups in exchange for management and licensing fees  constitute improper fee splitting or payment for referrals  in which case we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  our contracts could be found invalid and unenforceable  in whole or in part  or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements 
if so  we may be unable to restructure our contractual arrangements on favorable terms  which would adversely affect our business and operations 
our business practices may be found to violate anti kickback  physician self referral or false claims laws  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business the healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal and state regulation with respect to financial relationships and kickbacks involving healthcare providers  physician self referral arrangements  filing of false claims and other fraud and abuse issues 
federal anti kickback laws and regulations prohibit offers  payments  solicitations  or receipts of remuneration in return for i referring patients for items or services covered by medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare programs  or ii purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for or recommending any service  good  item or facility for which payment may be made by a federal health care program 
in addition  subject to numerous exceptions  federal physician self referral legislation  commonly known as the stark law  generally prohibits a physician from referring patients for certain designated health services reimbursable by medicare or medicaid from any entity with which the physician has a financial relationship  and many states have analogous laws 
other federal and state laws govern the submission of claims for reimbursement  or false claims laws 
one of the most prominent of these laws is the federal civil false claims act  and violations of other laws  such as the federal anti kickback law or the fda prohibitions against promotion of off label uses of drugs  
table of contents may also be prosecuted as violations of the civil false claims act 
compcare provides services to health plans that could become involved with false claims  which could include allegations against compcare as well 
federal or state authorities may claim that our fee arrangements  agreements and relationships with contractors  hospitals and physicians violate these laws and regulations 
violations of these laws may be punishable by monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  exclusion from participation in government sponsored healthcare programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws 
if our business practices are found to violate any of these provisions  we may be unable to continue with our relationships or implement our business plans  which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to healthcare anti fraud initiatives  which may lead to penalties and adversely affect our business state and federal governments are devoting increased attention and resources to anti fraud initiatives against healthcare providers  and may take an expansive definition of fraud that includes receiving fees in connection with a healthcare business that is found to violate any of the complex regulations described above 
while to our knowledge we have not been the subject of any anti fraud investigations  if such a claim were made defending our business practices could be time consuming and expensive  and an adverse finding could result in substantial penalties or require us to restructure our operations  which we may not be able to do successfully 
our use and disclosure of patient information is subject to privacy and security regulations  which may result in increased costs in conducting research or providing administrative services to healthcare providers in connection with the use of our treatment programs  we may collect  use  disclose  maintain and transmit patient information in ways that will be subject to many of the numerous state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the collection  use  disclosure  storage  transmission and or confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including the administrative simplification requirements of the health insurance portability and accountability act of and its implementing regulations hipaa 
the hipaa privacy rule restricts the use and disclosure of patient information  and requires safeguarding that information 
the hipaa security rule establishes elaborate requirements for safeguarding patient information transmitted or stored electronically 
hipaa applies to covered entities  which may include healthcare facilities and does include health plans that will contract for the use of our programs and our services 
the hipaa rules require covered entities to bind contractors like us to compliance with certain burdensome hipaa rule requirements known as business associate requirements 
if we are providing management services that include electronic billing on behalf of a physician practice or facility that is a covered entity  we may be required to conduct those electronic transactions in accordance with the hipaa regulations governing the form and format of those transactions hipaa transactions rule 
other federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy and security of patient information also apply to our licensees directly and in some cases to us  either directly or indirectly 
we may be required to make costly system purchases and modifications to comply with the hipaa rule requirements that are imposed on us and our failure to comply may result in liability and adversely affect our business 
compcare is subject to hipaa for most healthcare facilities and health plans that contract for the use of compcare s services 
the hipaa transactions rule requires compcare to comply with format and data content standards for common healthcare transactions on behalf of our licensees 
failure to comply may result in civil and criminal liability and penalties  and have a material adverse effect on compcare s ability to retain its customers or to gain new business 
federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the ftc and state attorneys general to regulate the collection  use  storage  and disclosure of personal or patient information  through web sites or otherwise  and to regulate the presentation of web site content 
courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the ftc  which concern consumer notice  choice  security and access 
numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality and security of personal and patient information 
other countries also have  or are developing laws governing the collection  use  disclosure and transmission of personal or patient information and these laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business 

table of contents our business arrangements with health care providers may be deemed to be franchises  which could negatively impact our business operations franchise arrangements in the united states are subject to rules and regulations of the ftc and various state laws relating to the offer and sale of franchises 
a number of the states in which we operate regulate the sale of franchises and require registration of the franchise offering circular with state authorities and the delivery of a franchise offering circular to prospective franchisees 
state franchise laws often limit  among other things  the duration and scope of non competitive provisions  the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply 
franchise laws and regulations are complex  apply broadly and are subject to interpretation by courts and government agencies 
federal or state authorities or healthcare providers with whom we contract may claim that the agreements under which we license rights to our technology and trademarks and provide services violate these laws and regulations 
violations of these laws are punishable by monetary fines  civil and criminal penalties  and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws 
if our business practices are found to constitute franchises  we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties  our contracts could be found invalid and unenforceable  in whole or in part  or we could be required to restructure our contractual arrangements 
we may be unable to continue with our relationships or restructure them on favorable terms  which would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may also be required to furnish prospective franchisees with a franchise offering circular containing prescribed information  and restrict how we market to or deal with healthcare providers  potentially limiting and substantially increasing our cost of doing business 
risks related to our common stock over of our stock is controlled by our chairman and chief executive officer  who has the ability to substantially influence the election of directors and other matters submitted to stockholders reserva capital  llc and bonmore  llc  whose sole managing member is our chairman and chief executive officer  beneficially own  shares of our common stock  which represent approximately of our  shares outstanding 
as a result  he has and is expected to continue to have the ability to significantly influence the election of our board of directors and the outcome of all other issues submitted to our stockholders 
the interests of these principal stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  and they may act in a manner that advances his best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders 
one consequence to this substantial influence or control is that it may be difficult for investors to remove management of the company 
it could also deter unsolicited takeovers  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices

the market price of our common stock has experienced  and may continue to experience  substantial volatility 
over  our common stock has traded between and per share  on volume ranging from approximately  to million shares per day 
as a result  the current price for our common stock on nasdaq is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our fair market value 
the price at which our common stock will trade may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including the number of shares available for sale in the market  quarterly variations in our operating results and actual or anticipated announcements of pilots and scientific studies of the effectiveness of our prometa treatment programs  new products or services by us or competitors  regulatory investigations or determinations  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  recruitment or departures of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in the estimates of our operating performance  actual or threatened litigation  market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole 
volatility in the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market may depress the trading price of the common stock our common stock 
the risk of volatility and depressed prices of our common stock also applies to warrant holders who receive shares of common stock upon conversion 

table of contents numerous factors  including many over which we have no control  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock  including announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors  current events affecting the political  economic and social situation in the united states and other countries where we operate  trends in our industry and the markets in which we operate  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  acquisitions and financings by us or our competitors  the gain or loss of a significant customer  quarterly variations in operating results  volatility in exchanges rate between the us dollar and the currencies of the foreign countries in which we operate  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may consider to be comparable  and purchases or sales of blocks of our securities 
furthermore  stockholders may initiate securities class action lawsuits if the market price of our stock drops significantly  which may cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management 
future sales of common stock by existing stockholders  or the perception that such sales may occur  could depress our stock price the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by  or the perceived possibility of sales by  our existing stockholders 
we have completed a number of private placements of our common stock and other securities over the last several years  and we have effective resale registration statements pursuant to which the purchasers can freely resell their shares into the market 
in addition  most of our outstanding shares are eligible for public resale pursuant to rule under the securities act of  as amended 
approximately million shares of our common stock are currently held by our affiliates and may be sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or in accordance with the volume and other limitations of rule or pursuant to other exempt transactions 
future sales of common stock by significant stockholders  including those who acquired their shares in private placements or who are affiliates  or the perception that such sales may occur  could depress the price of our common stock 
future issuances of common stock and hedging activities may depress the trading price of our common stock any future issuance of equity securities  including the issuance of shares upon exercise of outstanding warrants  could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  and could substantially decrease the trading price of our common stock 
we currently have outstanding more than million warrants and options to acquire our common stock at prices between and per share 
we may issue equity securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations and business strategy  in connection with acquisitions  to adjust our ratio of debt to equity  to satisfy our obligations upon the exercise of outstanding warrants or options or for other reasons 
additionally  we have outstanding warrants to acquire up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share that contain anti dilution adjustments that will be triggered if the sale price of the common stock is less than 

table of contents provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws  charter documents and delaware law could discourage a change in control  or an acquisition of us by a third party  even if the acquisition would be favorable to you  thereby and adversely affect existing stockholders our certificate of incorporation and the delaware general corporation law contain provisions that may have the effect of making more difficult or delaying attempts by others to obtain control of our company  even when these attempts may be in the best interests of stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors  without stockholder approval  to issue one or more series of preferred stock  which could have voting and conversion rights that adversely affect or dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock 
delaware law also imposes conditions on certain business combination transactions with interested stockholders 
these provisions and others that could be adopted in the future could deter unsolicited takeovers or delay or prevent changes in our control or management  including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
these provisions may also limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future  and accordingly you must rely on stock appreciation for any return on your investment we have paid no cash dividends on our common stock to date  and we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to fund the continued development and growth of our business 
as a result  we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
further  any payment of cash dividends will also depend on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors  including contractual restrictions to which we may be subject  and will be at the discretion of our board of directors
