item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide proprietary  value added products to a diverse customer base covering a broad spectrum of industries 
this strategic customer diversification means that demand for our products depends  in part  upon certain general economic conditions  which affect our markets in varying ways from year to year 
similar to and  during the company continued to benefit from a strong manufacturing economy 
as a result  the company experienced strong demand for its specialty products from various key markets including wind energy  machinery  aerospace  defense  and petrochemical processing  which resulted in record annual sales of million 
benefiting from the record sales  the company generated net income of million  and cash flow from operations of million during despite our strong cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased million during the year as the company invested million in net capital expenditures  million on an acquisition  million for stock repurchases  million to fully fund its qualified pension plans  and increased its common stock dividend 
the total order book for equaled million  compared to million in  and million in our record year end backlog of million provides a firm foundation for operating performance in  particularly in the latter half 
in  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of avon bearings corporation avon in a cash transaction valued at million 
avon is a custom designer and manufacturer of high precision large diameter turntable bearings 
avon also remanufactures bearings and sells replacement bearings 
the company continues to focus on programs intended to reduce costs  improve capacity utilization  increase efficiencies  and grow market share and cash flow  thereby positioning the company to capitalize on future opportunities in targeted markets  especially during a period of sustained economic growth 
during  the company announced two additional phases to increase its capacity to provide performance critical specialty bearings to serve the rapidly growing wind energy market 
the company also made substantial progress on the relocation of a portion of the manufacturing of its sealing products segment from a higher cost facility in baltimore  maryland to a lower cost facility in mocksville  north carolina 
we believe that these initiatives will be important growth drivers for both north american and international sales in the years ahead 
in addition  the company continued its lean sigma effort and its investments in lean manufacturing and information systems to strengthen the company s operational excellence 
the company s effective tax rate was percent as compared to the effective tax rate of percent which reflected in reductions to the tax provision totaling million related to deductions recognized for financial reporting purposes  after examinations by certain taxing authorities  or after the expiration of applicable review periods 
absent any similar items  we currently expect the effective tax rate for to be approximately percent 
maintaining the company s strong balance sheet and financial flexibility remains a key strategy of the company 
the company s current cash and short term investment balances  its million revolving credit facility  and other available financial resources enhance liquidity and provide additional financial strength to support the company s objectives  including strategic acquisitions 
as disclosed in item of this annual report  the company has concluded that its system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  our independent registered public accounting firm s report on internal control over financial reporting is also included in item under the heading report of independent registered public accounting firm internal control 
in summary  in the future the company expects to benefit from a favorable manufacturing economy and resultant capital spending levels  the growth of key markets such as the wind energy and medical equipment industries  and the utilization of current liquidity levels in completing both internal growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions 
however  because many of these factors are external to the company  it is difficult to predict the specific impact they may have on the company s future operating results 
the discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report to assist in understanding the company s results of operations  its financial condition  cash flows  capital structure and other relevant financial information

litigation we are a party to various other lawsuits and matters arising in the normal course of business that are pending 
the company s estimated legal costs expected to be incurred in connection with claims  lawsuits and environmental matters are accrued in the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from the current estimates made by the company 
we have identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products  and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to inventories to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that is compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
we believe the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  and projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note in this annual report for additional information regarding long lived assets 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a need  tests the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we identify impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is derived from an estimate of discounted future cash flows including estimates for terminal value 
in we used an percent discount rate  and a growth assumption of percent in perpetuity to calculate terminal value 
in an percent discount rate was utilized 
the discount rate used each year is the value weighted average of the company s estimated cost of equity and estimated cost of debt cost of capital derived using both known and estimated  customary  marketplace metrics 
the principal marketplace metric used in the estimation of the discount rate  which changed from to  was an industry capital structure that was more heavily weighted toward kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents the equity component  which has a higher cost 
our calculation methodology was unchanged during  and the consistent application of this methodology may result in changes in the discount rate in future periods 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying amount is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  normally a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist the company in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
certain trademarks are the company s only indefinite lived intangible assets 
we identify impairment of these trademarks by comparing their fair value to their carrying amounts 
the fair values of the trademarks are calculated based on estimates of discounted future cash flows related to the net amount of royalty expenses avoided due to the existence of the trademarks 
we believe the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of discounted future cash flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
contingent convertible senior subordinated notes we have outstanding million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  provided certain contingencies are met 
the notes become convertible during any calendar quarter if the closing sale price of company common stock is more than for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter 
based on this formula  holders will be able to convert their notes during the first quarter of holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on may    and  at percent of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued but unpaid interest including contingent interest and liquidated damages  if any to the date of repurchase  payable in cash 
if the holders of the notes exercise their right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on may   the company intends to refinance the obligation on a long term basis with its revolving credit facility 
because the company has the ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long term basis  the notes continue to be reported as long term debt at december  generally accepted accounting principles require that the impact of contingently convertible instruments that are convertible into common stock upon the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares  such as the company s notes  should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether or not the market price trigger has been met 
accordingly  net income used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share amounts is adjusted by adding back the after tax interest expense  including amortization of debt issuance costs attributable to the notes  and total shares outstanding are increased by the number of shares that would be issuable upon conversion 
in addition  the contingent interest feature of the notes requires the company to deduct for tax purposes an amount of interest expense that is greater than the stated coupon rate 
the additional interest deduction on the notes may have to be recaptured for tax purposes  in part or in whole  if the notes are redeemed or surrendered for conversion at an amount less than the tax accreted value 
should this happen  depending on other factors  tax payments may increase 
if the notes are redeemed or surrendered for conversion at an amount less than the tax accreted value  the deferred tax liability provided for  which totals million at december   would be eliminated through an adjustment to the company s shareholders equity and would not affect current tax accounts 
we believe that the impact the notes have on the accounting for our diluted earnings per share calculations  and tax related account balances as discussed above are critical to the understanding of our current financial condition and results of operations 
the existence of the notes has caused further dilution to our diluted earnings per share calculation  and redemption or surrender for conversion of the notes at an amount less than the tax accreted value may kaydon corporation form k 
table of contents cause volatility in tax payments  cash flows and the liquidity of the company 
to better understand the notes and their impact on the company s financial reporting  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note and other discussions in this annual report 
retirement benefits our employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on the company s estimates provided to and used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we believe the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits in our financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth rates  and long term returns on plan assets 
we have developed estimates based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
in developing the discount rate assumption used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations at september  and  the company calculated the cash flows represented by the projected benefit obligations of three pension plans constituting greater than percent of the company s pension plans total projected benefit obligation 
these cash flows were discounted at corresponding interest rates derived from a hypothetical yield curve constructed using the top quartile of high rated aa or aa non callable bonds with at least million of par value outstanding 
the equivalent weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
the discount rate applicable to the company s three largest pension plans was also used for all qualified pension plans and the company s postretirement benefit plans 
in and  a similar  independent development of the discount rate assumption was used for the non qualified pension plan 
prior to using the yield curve approach  the discount rate assumptions used for the pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs in were based on investment yields available on long term corporate bonds 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook  and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
salary growth assumptions reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
assumed discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  and rate of compensation increase have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plans 
a percent increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have increased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent increase in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and a percent decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during a percent increase in the rate of compensation increase would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have increased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent decrease in the rate of compensation increase would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million  and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million

income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed for recoverability by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
income tax is provided based upon an effective tax rate that is dependent upon tax regulations governing the regions in which we conduct business  geographic composition of worldwide earnings  the availability of tax credits and other factors 
in and our effective tax rate was affected by reductions to our tax provision related to deductions recognized for financial reporting purposes  after examinations by taxing authorities  or after the expiration of applicable review periods 
the company has liabilities recorded for unrecognized tax benefits totaling million as of december   all of which would affect the effective tax rate 
it is the company s policy to include interest and penalties incurred due to underpayment or late payment of income taxes due to a taxing authority on a net of tax basis as a component of income tax expense 
the company has recorded million in liabilities for tax related interest and penalties on its consolidated balance sheet  as of december  the company does not expect that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change within the next twelve months 
the company  or one of its subsidiaries  operates and files income tax returns in the united states  various states  and foreign jurisdictions 
foreign jurisdictions significant to the company include germany and the united kingdom 
with limited exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal tax examinations for years before  state examinations for years before  german tax examinations for years before  or united kingdom tax examinations for years before we believe the accounting estimates related to income taxes to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities and to record current tax benefits and liabilities  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents  and short term investments 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
short term investments include auction rate securities and other investments that are classified as available for sale and expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed within the next twelve months 
we place our investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average investment interest rate for would not have a material impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico  and asia 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies of these countries in these regions affect our financial condition and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which certain costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition and cash flows 
management s estimate of the fair value of long term debt is determined by reference to market data 
as of december   the fair value of long term debt is approximately percent greater than its recorded value 
the change in the fair value of long term debt  which is convertible into company common stock  would be expected to fluctuate consistently with the market price of company common stock
