under the terms of the agreement  pershing square has loaned million to the company and will purchase  at the company s discretion  certain of the company s international businesses pursuant to a million backstop purchase commitment 
the terms of the pershing square financing agreement have been approved by the lenders under the company s current revolving credit facility  and the revolving credit facility has been amended accordingly 
the financing agreement with pershing square consists of three main components a million senior secured term loan maturing january  with an interest rate of per annum 
the term loan is secured by an indirect pledge of approximately of the stock of paperchase products ltd 
paperchase pursuant to a deed of charge over shares 
in the event that paperchase is sold  all proceeds from the sale are required to be used to prepay the term loan 
the representations  covenants and events of default therein are otherwise substantially identical to the company s existing multicurrency revolving credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement  other than some relating to paperchase 
such exceptions are not expected to interfere with the operations of paperchase or the company in the ordinary course of business 
a backstop purchase offer that will give the company the right but not the obligation  until january   to require pershing square to purchase its paperchase  australia  new zealand and singapore subsidiaries  as well as its approximately interest in bookshop acquisitions  inc borders uk after the company has pursued a sale process to maximize the value of those assets 
pershing square s purchase obligation is at a price of million less any debt attributable to those assets and on customary terms to be negotiated 
proceeds of any such purchase by pershing square are to be first applied to repay amounts outstanding under the million term loan 
although the company believes that these businesses are worth substantially more than the backstop purchase offer price  the relative certainty of this arrangement provides the company with valuable flexibility to pursue strategic alternatives 
the company has retained the right  in its sole discretion  to forego the sale of these assets or to require pershing square to consummate the transaction 
pershing square has no right of first refusal or other preemptive right with respect to the sale of these businesses by the company to other parties

the warrants feature full anti dilution protection  including preservation of the right to convert into the same percentage of the fully diluted shares of the company s common stock that would be outstanding on a pro forma basis giving effect to the issuance of the shares underlying the warrants at all times  and full ratchet adjustment to the exercise price for future issuances in each case  subject to certain exceptions  and adjustments to compensate for all dividends and distributions 
for accounting purposes  the company allocated the proceeds from the financing agreement with pershing square between the senior secured term loan  the warrants  and the backstop purchase offer based upon their relative fair market values 
this will result in the recognition of a discount on the secured term loan of approximately million  which will be amortized to earnings over the term of the loan using the effective interest method 
the warrants will be recorded as liabilities at their fair market value of million  with subsequent changes in their fair market value to be recognized in earnings 
an intangible asset in the amount of approximately million related to the backstop purchase offer will 
table of contents also be recorded  and will be expensed if it becomes probable that the backstop purchase offer will not be executed 
if the backstop purchase offer is executed  the intangible asset will be added to the carrying value of the related businesses  and expensed upon sale

the maximum potential liability under these lease guarantees is approximately million 
the leases provide for periodic rent reviews  which could increase the company s potential liability 
one of the applicable lease guaranty agreements provides that the guaranty will automatically terminate if borders uk limited achieves a specified level of net assets 
this potential limitation has not been considered in calculating the maximum exposures set forth above 
in addition  in the event of a default under the primary leases and the landlord does not require the company to take a new replacement lease  the landlord would have an obligation to attempt to re lease the premises  which could further reduce the company s potential liability 
the company has recorded a contingent liability of approximately million based upon the likelihood that the company will be required to perform under the guarantees

fiscal dollars in millions q q q q sales operating income loss of full year sales fiscal dollars in millions q q q q sales operating income loss of full year sales critical accounting policies and estimates in the ordinary course of business  the company has made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates 
asset impairments the carrying value of long lived store assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  the company compares the expected cash flows to the carrying value of long lived assets for the applicable stores 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over the assets remaining useful lives  contain estimates of sales and the impact those future sales will have upon cash flows 
future sales are estimated based  in part  upon a projection of each store s sales trend based on the actual sales of the past several years 
additionally  each store s future cash contribution is based upon the most recent year s actual cash contribution  but is adjusted based upon projected trends in sales and store operating costs 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows  with the discount rate approximating the company s borrowing rate 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
the carrying value of non store long lived assets is also evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over each asset s remaining useful life  contain estimates of future cash flows based on projected trends in sales and operating costs 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows  with the discount rate approximating the company s borrowing rate 
goodwill impairment pursuant to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  the company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more 
table of contents frequently if impairment indicators arise 
pursuant to fas  a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment a component  for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by management 
the company s reporting units were identified as the operating segments of domestic borders superstores and waldenbooks specialty retail  and the regional components of the international operating segment 
the carrying amounts of the net assets of the applicable reporting units including goodwill are compared to the estimated fair values of those reporting units 
fair value is principally estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depends on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity and capitalization 
the discount rate used approximates the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
changes in any of the assumptions underlying these estimates may result in the future impairment of goodwill 
if an impairment is detected due to the carrying value of the reporting unit being greater than the fair value  fas requires that an analysis be completed to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment 
to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to each of the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
the amount of fair value remaining if any after this allocation is then compared to the recorded value of goodwill 
if the remaining fair value exceeds the recorded value of goodwill  no impairment exists 
if  however  the remaining fair value is less than the recorded value of goodwill  goodwill must be reduced to the amount of remaining fair value  with the reduction being recorded as an expense on the statement of operations 
inventory the carrying value of the company s inventory is affected by reserves for shrinkage  markdowns and non returnable inventory 
projections of shrinkage are based upon the results of regular  periodic physical counts of the company s inventory 
the company s shrinkage reserve is adjusted as warranted based upon the trends yielded by the physical counts 
reserves for non returnable inventory are based upon the company s history of liquidating non returnable inventory 
the markdown percentages utilized in developing the reserve are evaluated against actual  ongoing markdowns of non returnable inventory to ensure that they remain consistent 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or non returnable inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
the company includes certain distribution and other expenses in its inventory costs  particularly freight  distribution payroll  and certain occupancy expenses 
in addition  certain selling  general and administrative expenses are included in inventory costs 
these amounts totaled approximately million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
the extent to which these costs are included in inventory is based on certain estimates of space and labor allocation 
leases all leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases fas  as amended 
the company uses its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification 
gift cards the company sells gift cards to its customers and records a liability for the face value of all certificates issued and unredeemed within the last months 
for certificates older than months  the company records a liability for a portion of the certificates face value based upon historical redemption trends  and records the related income as a component of other revenue 
to the extent that future redemption patterns differ from those historically experienced  significant variations in the recorded reserves may result 
advertising and vendor incentive programs the company receives payments and credits from vendors pursuant to co operative advertising programs  shared markdown programs  purchase volume incentive programs and magazine slotting programs 
these 
table of contents programs continue to be beneficial for both the company and vendors  and the company expects continued participation in these types of programs 
changes in vendor participation levels  as well as changes in the volume of merchandise purchased  among other factors  could adversely impact the company s results of operations and liquidity 
pursuant to co operative advertising programs offered by vendors  the company contracts with vendors to promote merchandise for specified time periods 
pursuant to the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  vendor consideration which represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs is included in the selling  general and administrative line on the consolidated statements of operations  along with the related costs  in the period the promotion takes place 
consideration which exceeds such costs is classified as a reduction of the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  the company has recorded million and million of vendor consideration as a reduction to its inventory balance at february  and february   respectively 
the company also receives credits from vendors pursuant to shared markdown programs  purchase volume programs  and magazine slotting programs 
credits received pursuant to these programs are classified in the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations  and are recognized upon certain product volume thresholds being met or product placements occurring 
income taxes the company must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
the company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether  and to the extent which  additional taxes will be due 
the company recognizes the tax effects of a position only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold represents a positive assertion by management that a company is entitled to the economic benefits of a tax position 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits  no benefits of the position are to be recognized 
moreover  the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
the company also records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets arising from certain net operating losses when it is more likely than not that some portion of all of such net operating losses will not be realized 
the company s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings  changes in the expected outcome of audit controversies or changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance
