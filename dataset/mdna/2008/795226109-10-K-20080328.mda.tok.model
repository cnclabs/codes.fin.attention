in general  the pic will earn mortgage interest income and may dividend funds to the bank 
in turn  those funds will be exempt from the connecticut corporate business tax 
competition the company and the bank encounter competition in all phases of their business 
there are numerous financial institutions that have offices in the areas in which the company and bank compete in northwestern connecticut  western massachusetts and proximate areas of new york state 
the offices of the bank are located in the northwest corner of litchfield county  connecticut  south berkshire county  massachusetts and dutchess county  new york 
the bank maintains seven banking offices within these three counties and also attracts customers from nearby columbia county  new york 
the bank s market area within the four counties is served by commercial banks and savings banks 
banks compete on the basis of price  including rates paid on deposits and charged on borrowings  convenience and quality of service 
savings and loan associations are able to compete aggressively with commercial banks in the important area of consumer lending 
credit unions and small loan companies are significant factors in the consumer market 
insurance companies  investment firms  credit and mortgage companies  brokerage firms cash management accounts  money market funds and retailers are all significant competitors for various types of business 
insurance companies  investment counseling firms and other businesses and individuals actively compete with the bank for personal and corporate trust services and investment counseling services 
many non bank competitors are not subject to the extensive regulation described below under legislation  regulation and supervision and in certain respects may have a competitive advantage over banks in providing certain services 
in marketing its services  the bank emphasizes its position as a hometown bank with personal service  flexibility and prompt responsiveness to the needs of its customers 
moreover  the bank competes for both deposits and loans by offering competitive rates and convenient business hours 
in addition to providing banking services to customers in its primary service areas  the bank is a member of the automatic teller machine networks and offers internet banking services  which allow the bank to deliver certain financial services to customers regardless of their proximity to the primary service area of the bank 
connecticut grants banking powers for thrift institutions thereby improving their competitive position with other banks 
in addition  the connecticut interstate banking and branching act permits acquisitions and mergers of connecticut banks and bank holding companies with banks and bank holding companies in other states 
accordingly  it is possible for large super regional organizations to enter many new markets  including the market served by the bank 
certain competitors  by virtue of their size and resources  may enjoy certain efficiencies and competitive advantages over the bank in the pricing  delivery  and marketing of their products and services 
it is possible that such legislative authority will increase the number or the size of financial institutions competing with the bank for deposits and loans in its market place  although it is impossible to predict the effect upon competition of such legislation 
legislation  regulation and supervision general virtually every aspect of the business of banking is subject to regulation  including such matters as the amount of reserves that must be established against various deposits  the establishment of branches  mergers  non banking activities and other operations 
numerous laws and regulations also set forth special restrictions and procedural requirements with respect to the extension of credit  credit practices  the disclosure of credit terms and discrimination in credit transactions 
the descriptions of the statutory provisions and regulations applicable to banks set forth below do not purport to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the bank 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently introduced in congress  in the state legislatures and before the various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood and timing of any changes and the impact such changes might have on the bank s future business and earnings are difficult to determine

federal legislation permits adequately capitalized bank holding companies to venture across state lines to offer banking services through bank subsidiaries to a wide geographic market

while the glba facilitates the ability of financial institutions to offer a wide range of financial services  large financial institutions would appear to be the beneficiaries of this act because many community banks lack the capital and management resources needed to facilitate broad expansion of financial services

a full trust and investment services division is also located in lakeville  connecticut 
the management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition that follows presents management s comments on the consolidated operating results of the company 
in order to provide a foundation for building shareholder value and servicing customers  the company remains committed to investing in the technological and human resources necessary for developing and delivering new personalized financial products and services in order to better serve both current and future customers in the tri state area 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements that are presented as part of this annual report on form k 
forward looking statements this annual report and future filings made by the company with the securities and exchange commission  as well as other filings  reports and press releases made or issued by the company and the bank  and oral statements made by executive officers of the company and the bank  may include forward looking statements relating to such matters as a assumptions concerning future economic and business conditions and their effect on the economy in general and on the markets in which the company and the bank do business  and b expectations for increased revenues and earnings for the company and bank through growth resulting from acquisitions  attraction of new deposit and loan customers and the introduction of new products and services 
such forward looking statements are based on assumptions rather than historical or current facts and  therefore  are inherently uncertain and subject to risk 
for those statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation act of the company notes that a variety of factors could cause the actual results or experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations described or implied by such forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may effect the operation  performance  development and results of the company s and bank s business include the following a the risk of adverse changes in business conditions in the banking industry generally and in the specific markets in which the bank operates  b changes in the legislative and regulatory environment that negatively impact the company and bank through increased operating expenses  c increased competition from other financial and non financial institutions  d the impact of technological advances  and e other risks detailed from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission 
such developments could have an adverse impact on the company s and the bank s financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the company s financial statements  management selects and applies numerous accounting policies 
in applying these policies  management must make estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policy that is most susceptible to critical estimates and assumptions is the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of an appropriate provision is based on a determination of the probable amount of credit losses in the loan portfolio 
many factors influence the amount of future loan losses  relating to both the specific characteristics of the loan portfolio and general economic conditions nationally and locally 
while management carefully considers these factors in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary due to changed conditions  which could have an adverse impact on reported earnings in the future

the primary source is through the management of its financial assets and liabilities and involves functioning as a financial intermediary 
the company accepts funds from depositors and borrows funds and either lends the funds to borrowers or invests those funds in various types of securities 
the second source is fee income  which is discussed in the noninterest income section of this analysis 
net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans  interest and dividends earned on securities the company s earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds  primarily in the form of advances from the federal home loan bank 
the amount by which interest income will exceed interest expense depends on two factors the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared with the interest rate paid on those interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds

credit risk is inherent in the business of extending loans 
the company monitors the loan portfolio to ensure that loan quality will not be sacrificed for growth or otherwise compromise the company s objectives 
because of the risk associated with extending loans  the company maintains an allowance or reserve for loan and lease losses through charges to earnings 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a monthly basis 
such evaluations are based on assessments of credit quality and trends within the portfolio and risk rating of loans by senior management  which is reviewed by the company s loan committee on a regular basis 
loans are initially risk rated when originated 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality  the risk rating is adjusted accordingly

 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas 
impaired loans receive individual evaluation of the allowance necessary on a monthly basis 
loans to be considered for impairment are defined in the company s loan policy as commercial loans with balances outstanding of  or more and residential real estate mortgages with balances of  or more 
such loans are considered impaired when it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all principal and interest due according to the terms of the note 
any such commercial loan and or residential mortgage will be considered for impairment under any of the following circumstances non accrual status  loans over days delinquent  troubled debt restructures consummated after december   loans classified as doubtful  meaning that they have weaknesses  which make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
the individual allowance for any impaired loan is based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
in addition  a risk of loss factor is applied in evaluating categories of loans as part of the periodic analysis of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
this analysis reviews the allocations of the different categories of loans within the portfolio and considers historical loan losses and delinquency balances as well as recent delinquent percentage trends 
the credit card delinquency and loss history is separately evaluated and given a special loan loss factor because management recognizes the higher risk involved in such loans 
concentrations of credit and local economic factors are also evaluated on a periodic basis 
historical averages of net losses by loan types are examined as well as trends by type 
the bank s loan mix over the same period of time is also analyzed 
a loan loss allocation is made for each type of loan multiplied by the loan mix percentage for each loan type to produce a weighted average factor 
while management estimates loan losses using the best available information  no assurances can be given that future additions to the allowance will not be necessary based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions  identification of additional problem loans or other factors 
additionally  despite the excellent overall quality of the loan portfolio and expectations of the company to continue to grow its existing portfolio  future additions to the allowance may be necessary to maintain adequate reserve coverage

see note to the financial statements 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the company 
interest rate risk is defined as an exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on net interest income 
net interest income is sensitive to interest rate risk to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than earning assets 
the bank s assets and liabilities are managed in accordance with policies established and reviewed by the bank s board of directors 
the bank s asset liability management committee monitors asset and deposit levels  developments and trends in interest rates  liquidity and capital 
one of the primary financial objectives is to manage interest rate risk and control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates in order to prudently improve net interest income and manage the maturities and interest rate sensitivities of assets and liabilities 
the bank uses asset liability modeling software to develop scenario analyses  which measure the impact that changing interest rates have on net interest income 
these model simulations are projected out over a two year time horizon  assuming proportional upward and downward interest rate movements of  and basis points 
simulations are projected out in two ways using the same balance sheet as the bank had on the simulation date  and using a growing balance sheet based on recent growth patterns and strategies 
as interest rates rise or fall  these simulations incorporate expected future lending rates  current and expected future funding sources and cost  the possible exercise of options  changes in prepayment rates  and other factors which may be important in determining the future growth of net interest income 
the rates the company earns on its assets and the rates it pays on its liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time 
imbalance in these contractual maturities can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time 
in a period of rising interest rates  the interest income earned on assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on liabilities 
in a period of declining interest rates the interest income earned on assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest paid on liabilities 
this would primarily be attributed to accelerated prepayments on loans and securities that are significantly influenced by movements in market rates 
the net interest margin may be adversely affected by several possible interest rate environments 
foremost  a continued flat or inverted yield curve may result in shorter term market interest rates that equal or exceed those of longer term rates 
this could further increase the bank s cost of interest bearing liabilities that continue to outpace its yield on earning assets resulting in additional net interest rate spread compression 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to raise funds on a timely basis at an acceptable cost in order to meet cash needs 
adequate liquidity is necessary to handle fluctuation in deposit levels  to provide for customers credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented 
the company manages liquidity primarily with readily marketable investment securities  deposits and loan repayments 
the company s subsidiary  the bank  is a member of the federal home loan bank of boston  which provides a source of available borrowings for liquidity 
at december   the company had approximately  in loan commitments outstanding 
management believes that the current level of liquidity is ample to meet the company s needs for both the present and foreseeable future 
capital at december   the company had  in shareholders equity compared to  at december  this represents an increase of  or 
several components contributed to the change since december earnings for the year totaled  securities in the portfolio that are classified as available for sale are adjusted to fair value monthly and the unrealized losses or gains are not included in earnings  but are reported as a net amount less expected tax as a separate component of capital until realized 
market fluctuations of fair value of the securities portfolio during resulted in other comprehensive loss net of tax totaling  the initial application of sfas no 
 as described in note to the financial statements  resulted in other comprehensive income  net of tax of  in the company declared dividends in resulting in a decrease in capital of  the company issued new shares of common stock under the terms of the director stock retainer plan during the second quarter of  which resulted in an increase in capital of  under current regulatory definitions  the bank is considered to be well capitalized for capital adequacy purposes 
as a result  the bank pays the lowest federal deposit insurance deposit premiums possible 
one primary measure of capital adequacy for regulatory purposes is based on the ratio of risk based capital to risk weighted assets 
this method of measuring capital adequacy helps to establish capital requirements that are sensitive to the differences in risk associated with various assets 
it takes into account off balance sheet exposure in assessing capital adequacy and it minimizes disincentives to holding liquid  low risk assets 
at year end  the bank had a total risk based capital ratio of compared to at december  maintaining strong capital is essential to bank safety and soundness 
however  the effective management of capital resources requires generating attractive returns on equity to build value for shareholders while maintaining appropriate levels of capital to fund growth  meet regulatory requirements and be consistent with prudent industry practices 
management believes that the capital ratios of the company and bank are adequate to continue to meet the foreseeable capital needs of the institution 
impact of inflation and changing prices the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measurement of financial condition and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money  over time  due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary and as a result  interest rates tend to have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services  inflation could impact earnings in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
in the opinion of management  these off balance sheet arrangements are not likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity
