item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the major elements of our balance sheets and statements of income 
this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and other detailed information 
overview we conduct operations in full service banking centers and a commercial private banking center in six contiguous counties in central kentucky along the interstate corridor 
our markets range from the major metropolitan area of louisville in jefferson county  kentucky approximately miles north of our headquarters in elizabethtown  kentucky to hart county  kentucky  approximately miles south of elizabethtown 
our core markets have experienced a growth rate of in deposits for the past three years 
we anticipate that our markets will continue to grow at a similar rate for the next few years and believe we are well positioned to benefit from this anticipated growth 
over the past several years we have focused on enhancing and expanding our retail and commercial banking network in our core markets as well as establishing our presence in the louisville market 
our core markets  the five counties other than louisville jefferson county  where we have a combined market share  have become increasingly competitive as several new banks have entered those markets during the past few years 
in order to protect and grow our market share  we replaced existing branches with newer  enhanced facilities and anticipate constructing several new facilities over the next few years 
in addition to the enhancement and expansion in our core markets  we have been increasing our presence in the louisville market 
approximately of the deposit base in the louisville market is controlled by six out of state banks 
while the market is very competitive  we believe this creates an opportunity for smaller community banks with more power to make decisions locally 
we believe our investment in these initiatives along with our continued commitment to a high level of customer service will enhance our market share in our core markets and our development in the louisville market 
our retail branch network continues to generate encouraging results 
total deposits have grown at an growth rate over the past three years 
total deposits were million at december   an increase of million  or for the year 
the continued development of the retail branch network into the louisville market also yielded positive results 
we have a combined million in deposits in our three full service facilities in the louisville market representing a increase in deposits for the year 
we opened two of these facilities in the second quarter of to support our growing customer base in this market 
in june we opened our third new full service banking center in the louisville market 
we have developed a strong commercial real estate niche in our markets 
we have an experienced team of bankers who are focused on providing service and convenience to our customers 
it is quite common for our bankers to close loans at a customer s place of business or even the customer s personal residence 
this high level of service has been especially well received in the louisville market  which is dominated by regional banks 
currently  borrowers representing of our loan portfolio resides in the louisville market 
to further develop our commercial banking relationships in louisville  we opened a private banking office in april this office is an upscale facility complementing our retail branch network in louisville  allowing us to further attract commercial deposit relationships in conjunction with our commercial lending relationships 
this emphasis on commercial lending generated a growth rate in the total loan portfolio and a growth rate in commercial loans over the past three years 
commercial loans were million at december   an increase of million  or  from december  commercial checking balances were million at december  we have experienced a growth rate in commercial checking accounts over the past three years 
the growth in our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolio  coupled with our efforts to fund these loans with lower cost customer deposits is our primary business model and has substantially contributed to the growth in earnings over the past several years 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses is critical to the understanding of our results of operations since the application of this policy requires significant management assumptions and estimates that could result in materially different amounts to be reported if conditions or underlying circumstances were to change 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance sufficient to absorb probable incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
we estimate the allowance using past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
while we estimate the allowance for loan losses based in part on historical losses within each loan category  estimates for losses within the commercial and commercial real estate portfolio are more dependent upon credit analysis and recent payment performance 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans or loan categories  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
the allowance consists of specific and general components 
the specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired or loans otherwise classified as substandard or doubtful 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors 
allowance estimates are developed with actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates are considered a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio and are applied to individual loans based on loan type 
based on our calculation  an allowance of million or of total loans was our estimate of probable losses within the loan portfolio as of december  this estimate resulted in a provision for loan losses on the income statement of million for if the mix and amount of future charge off percentages differ significantly from the assumptions used by management in making its determination  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses on the income statement could be materially increased 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment revised  on january  among other things  sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value based method of accounting and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation expense in the income statement based on their fair values on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r requires that management make assumptions including stock price volatility and expected forfeitures that are utilized to measure compensation expense 
we estimate fair value of stock options granted at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  such as volatility  risk free interest rates and dividend pay out rates 
results of operation net income for the period ended december  was million or per share diluted compared to million or per share diluted for the same period in earnings decreased for compared to due to a decrease in our net interest margin  an increase in provision for loan loss expense and a higher level of non interest expense related to our expansion efforts 
our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
net income for the period ended december  was million or per share diluted compared to million or per share diluted for the same period in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net interest income of million and a decrease in provision for loan loss expense of  our book value per common share increased from at december  to at december  net income for generated a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of 
these compare with a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of for the period 
net interest income the principal source of our revenue is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities and the interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by both changes in the amount and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as changes in market interest rates 
the growth in our commercial loan portfolio has increased the level of interest income generated 
average interest earning assets increased million for compared to the yield on earning assets averaged for the period compared to an average yield on earning assets of for the same period in this increase was offset by a larger increase in our cost of funds 
net interest margin as a percent of average earning assets decreased basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the period 
our cost of funds averaged for the period compared to an average cost of funds of for the same period in deposit costs have accelerated due to the re pricing of maturing certificates of deposit that rolled off into new certificates of deposit at higher interest rates 
in addition  we were paying higher rates on our money market products 
offsetting the increase in deposit costs was a decrease in interest expense relating to the refinancing of in subordinated debentures 
refinancing at a lower rate reduced interest expense by  during going forward  our cost of funds is expected to decrease as certificates of deposit re price and roll off into new certificates of deposit at lower interest rates 
the increase in the volume of interest earning assets has resulted in an increase in net interest income of million for compared to the same period a year ago 
our net interest margin is likely to compress in future quarters as a result of the recent basis point decrease by the federal open market committee fomc  as our loan portfolio is primarily priced off the prime rate and our deposits are priced off of the london interbank offering rate libor 
since september  the prime rate decreased basis points in conjunction with the fomc rate decrease lowering our yield on loans 
libor  which is a market driven rate  did not decline in rate as much as the prime rate 
therefore  our deposit costs will not decline as fast as our yield on loans 
this will in turn lower our net interest margin

dollars in thousands non interest income change change customer sevice fees on deposit accounts    gain on sale of mortgage loans gain on sale of investments gain on sale of real estate held for development brokerage commissions other income    growth in customer service fees on deposit accounts  our largest component of non interest income  is primarily due to growth in customer deposits  overdraft fee income on retail checking accounts and the sale of fee based products for  and we continue to increase our customer base through cross selling opportunities and marketing initiatives and promotions 
in addition  we continue to emphasize growing our checking account base to better enhance our profitability and franchise value 
we originate qualified va  khc  rhc and conventional secondary market loans and sell them into the secondary market with servicing rights released 
gain on sale of mortgage loans decreased for  and due to the steady decrease in the volume of loans refinanced and originated and sold due to the stabilizing interest rate environment and higher rates than in previous years 
we expect gain on sales of mortgage loans to increase in due to the recent decrease in interest rates 
we invest in various types of liquid assets  including united states treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  mutual funds  stocks and others 
during and we did not record any gains on the sale of investments compared to  in recorded gains for the period 
gains on investment securities are infrequent in nature and are not a consistent recurring source of income 
through our subsidiary  first federal office park  we hold commercial lots adjacent to our home office on ring road in elizabethtown  that are available for sale 
during and we recorded  and  in gains from lot sales 
currently  one of the original nine lots held for sale remains unsold

dollars in thousands non interest expenses change change employee compensation and benefits    office occupancy expense and equipment    marketing and advertising outside services and data processing    bank franchise tax write off of issuance cost of trust preferred securities other expense    employee compensation and benefits is the largest component of non interest expense 
compensation expense increased for due to an increase in staff needed for our continued growth and expansion as well as annual raises 
three commercial lending associates and twenty one retail associates have been added with our expansion efforts 
these associates were hired for a commercial private banking center that opened in april  a new louisville retail branch facility that opened in june  and other positions to support or growth 
we have increased our staff in each of the last three years as we expand the products and services we offer our retail and commercial customers and increase the number and size of our branch offices 
we look for a continued increase in employee compensation and benefits expense in line with recent years  as we progress with our retail expansion and market protection efforts 
office occupancy expense and equipment  marketing and advertising  and outside services and data processing increased due to additional operating expenses related to our expansion efforts in each of the last three years 
we anticipate the increased level of non interest expense to continue in with continued retail expansion 
included in other expense for is  in unamortized subordinated debentures issuance cost from the redemption of all of our underlying million issuance of cumulative trust preferred securities 
these securities paid distributions at a quarterly adjustable rate of libor plus basis points on march  
we obtained new subordinated debentures at a year fixed rate of 
in we created a new debit rewards program intended to increase debit card activity 
expenses related to this program were  for also during  interchange expense increased  due to the switch to real time debit card processing  which is more expensive per item than the batch processing method we used during other expense also increased for due to  recorded for back taxes paid on a repossessed real estate property 
our efficiency ratio was for compared to for the period 
income taxes the effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  during we accrued  in state income tax  net of the federal benefit  in a contiguous state 
our level of interest income generated from properties financed in this state increased to a level which required us to pay state income tax 
this contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate to 
for the year ended december   we recorded a  reduction of federal income tax as a result of a re evaluation of our tax contingency reserves 
income tax expense was reduced by this amount  resulting in an effective tax rate of for the year ended going forward  we anticipate an effective tax rate of approximately 
analysis of financial condition total assets at december  increased to million compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase was primarily driven by an increase in loans of million 
the growth in loans was funded with deposits  which increased million for the period as well as million in proceeds from investment securities

an increase in loan charge offs or non performing loans or an inadequate allowance for loan losses could reduce net interest income  net income and capital and limit the range of products and services we can offer 
the allowance for loan loss review committee evaluates the allowance for loan losses quarterly to maintain a level sufficient to absorb incurred credit losses existing in the loan portfolio 
periodic provisions to the allowance are made as needed 
the allowance is determined based on the application of loss estimates to graded loans by categories 
the amount of the provision for loan losses necessary to maintain an adequate allowance is also based upon an analysis of such factors as changes in lending policies and procedures  underwriting standards  collection  charge off and recovery history  changes in national and local economic business conditions and developments  changes in the characteristics of the portfolio  ability and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due  non accrual and classified loans  troubled debt restructuring and other loan modifications  and results of regulatory examinations

the allowance for loan losses increased  to million from december  to december  the increase in the allowance was related to a million increase in net loans for the year  as well as provision recorded  in conjunction with a million increase in classified loans for the period 
net charge offs increased  for the period which was primarily the result of a  charge off during the fourth quarter on a commercial loan 
the loan was fully reserved for in a prior quarter 
the provision for loan losses decreased  to  for  compared to we recorded a smaller provision for due to an improvement in our security and position of certain classified loans during the period  as noted above 
in addition  our provision for loan loss was higher in  resulting from two classified loans downgraded to substandard 
the allowance for loan losses increased  to million from december  to december  the increase in the allowance in reflected a million increase in net loans for the year  as well as a million increase in classified loans 
the following table depicts management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type 
allowance and allocation is based on management s current evaluation of risk in each category  economic conditions  past loss experience  loan volume  past due history and other factors 
since these factors and management s assumptions are subject to change  the allocation is not a prediction of future portfolio performance

the regulations provide for three categories of classified loans substandard  doubtful and loss 
a bank must establish general allowances for loan losses for any assets classified as substandard or doubtful 
if an asset or portion thereof is classified as loss  the bank must either establish specified allowances for loan losses in the amount of of the portion of the asset classified loss  or charge off the amount of the loss 
the following table provides information with respect to classified loans for the periods indicated december  dollars in thousands classified loans substandard   doubtful loss total classified   the million increase in substandard assets for was primarily the result of the downgrading of loans with six borrowers in the amounts of a million  million  million  million   and  respectively 
offsetting this increase were upgrades of three classified loans having balances of million  million and million 
approximately million of the total classified loans were related to real estate development or real estate construction loans in our market area 
these loans were classified during classified consumer loans totaled million  classified mortgage loans totaled million and classified commercial loans totaled million 
we remain well secured and adequately collateralized with these credits 
although we may allocate a portion of the allowance to specific loans or loan categories  the entire allowance is available for any charge offs 
we develop our allowance estimates based on actual loss experience adjusted for current economic conditions 
allowance estimates represent a prudent measurement of the risk in the loan portfolio  which we apply to individual loans based on loan type 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of certain restructured loans for which interest rate or other terms have been renegotiated  loans on which interest is no longer accrued  real estate acquired through foreclosure and repossessed assets 
we do not have any loans greater than days past due still on accrual 
loans  including impaired loans under sfas  are placed on non accrual status when they become past due days or more as to principal or interest  unless they are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
loans are considered impaired when we no longer anticipate full principal or interest payments in accordance with the contractual loan terms 
we carry impaired loans at the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is secured by collateral 
we review our loans on a regular basis and implement normal collection procedures when a borrower fails to make a required payment on a loan 
if the delinquency on a mortgage loan exceeds days and is not cured through normal collection procedures or an acceptable arrangement is not worked out with the borrower  we institute measures to remedy the default  including commencing a foreclosure action 
we generally charge off consumer loans when management deems a loan uncollectible and any available collateral has been liquidated 
we handle commercial business and real estate loan delinquencies on an individual basis with the advice of legal counsel 
we recognize interest income on loans on the accrual basis except for those loans in a non accrual of income status 
we discontinue accruing interest on impaired loans when management believes  after consideration of economic and business conditions and collection efforts that the borrowers financial condition is such that collection of interest is doubtful  typically after the loan becomes days delinquent 
when we discontinue interest accrual  we reverse existing accrued interest and subsequently recognize interest income only to the extent we receive cash payments 
we classify real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure as real estate owned until such time as it is sold 
we classify new and used automobile  motorcycle and all terrain vehicles acquired as a result of foreclosure as repossessed assets until they are sold 
when such property is acquired we record it at the lower of the unpaid principal balance of the related loan or its fair market value 
we charge any write down of the property at the time of acquisition to the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent gains and losses are included in non interest income and non interest expense 
real estate acquired through foreclosure increased  to million at december  compared to  at december  the increase was the result of a commercial real estate credit relationship totaling million

this was primarily the result of four commercial real estate credit relationships totaling million  million   and  of these relationships  million was related to real estate development or real estate construction loans in our market area 
these credit relationships are well secured and no loss is expected 
non performing assets for the period include million in restructured commercial  residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the restructured loans primarily consist of two credit relationships with balances of million and  the terms of these loans have been renegotiated to reduce the rate of interest or extend the term  thus reducing the amount of cash flow required from the borrower to service the loans 
the borrowers are currently meeting the terms of the restructured loans 
non performing assets for the period include million in restructured commercial  residential mortgage and consumer loans 
the restructured loans primarily consist of two credit relationships with balances of million and  investment securities interest on securities provides us our largest source of interest income after interest on loans  constituting of the total interest income for the year ended december  the securities portfolio serves as a source of liquidity and earnings and contributes to the management of interest rate risk 
we have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets  including short term united states treasury obligations and securities of various federal agencies  obligations of states and political subdivisions  corporate bonds  certificates of deposit at insured savings and loans and banks  bankers acceptances  and federal funds 
we may also invest a portion of our assets in certain commercial paper and corporate debt securities 
we are also authorized to invest in mutual funds and stocks whose assets conform to the investments that we are authorized to make directly 
the available for sale and held to maturity investment portfolios decreased by million during the period as securities were called for redemption in accordance with their terms due to increasing rates 
during the year we made purchases of investments in state and municipal obligations 
the state and municipal obligations have an average life of years 
we purchased these securities to enhance earnings and manage interest rate risk by placing assets with longer terms on the balance sheet 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information concerning the investment portfolio 
we review unrealized losses at least on a quarterly basis to determine whether the losses are other than temporary and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
we consider the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and our intent and ability to retain the investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
in analyzing an issuer s financial condition  we may consider whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies  whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred  and the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition 
the unrealized losses on these temporarily impaired securities are a result of changes in interest rates for fixed rate securities where the interest rate received is less than the current rate available for new offerings of similar securities 
because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the following table provides the carrying value of our securities portfolio at the dates indicated

deposits we rely primarily on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits 
market interest rates and rates on deposit products offered by competing financial institutions can significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits 
we attract both short term and long term deposits from the general public by offering a wide range of deposit accounts and interest rates 
in recent years market conditions have caused us to rely increasingly on short term certificate accounts and other deposit alternatives that are more responsive to market interest rates 
we use forecasts based on interest rate risk simulations to assist management in monitoring our use of certificates of deposit and other deposit products as funding sources and the impact of the use of those products on interest income and net interest margin in various rate environments 
in conjunction with our initiatives to expand and enhance our retail branch network  we emphasize growing our customer checking account base to better enhance profitability and franchise value 
total deposits increased million for compared to retail and commercial deposits increased million and we added million in public funds and brokered certificates of deposit for the year 
the increase in retail deposits was primarily in certificate of deposit balances due to branch promotional campaigns 
to evaluate our funding needs in light of deposit trends resulting from these changing conditions  management and board committees evaluate simulated performance reports that forecast changes in margins 
we continue to offer attractive certificate rates for various terms to allow us to retain deposit customers and reduce interest rate risk during the current rate environment  while protecting the margin 
we offer a broad selection of deposit instruments  including non interest bearing checking  statement and passbook savings accounts  health savings accounts  now accounts  money market accounts and fixed and variable rate certificates with varying maturities 
we also offer tax deferred individual retirement accounts 
the flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and competition 
as of december   approximately of our deposits consisted of various savings and demand deposit accounts from which customers can withdraw funds at any time without penalty 
management periodically adjusts interest rates paid on our deposit products  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties 
we also offer certificates of deposit with a variety of terms  interest rates and minimum deposit requirements 
the variety of deposit accounts allows us to compete more effectively for funds and to respond with more flexibility to the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investment vehicles such as government and corporate securities 
however  market conditions continue to significantly affect our ability to attract and maintain deposits and our cost of funds 
the following table breaks down our deposits

these borrowings averaged a rate of for and for advances from federal home loan bank deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for our general business purposes 
we can also use advances borrowings from the fhlb of cincinnati to compensate for reductions in deposits or deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
advances from the fhlb are secured by our stock in the fhlb  certain securities  certain commercial real estate loans and substantially all of our first mortgage  multi family and open end home equity loans 
at december  we had million in advances outstanding from the fhlb and the capacity to increase our borrowings an additional million 
the fhlb of cincinnati functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for savings banks and other member financial institutions 
as a member  we are required to own capital stock in the fhlb and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our home mortgages  other real estate loans and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided that we meet certain creditworthiness standards

the objective of liquidity risk management is to ensure that we can meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  as well as our operating cash needs  at a reasonable cost  taking into account all on and off balance sheet funding demands 
we maintain an investment and funds management policy  which identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements in compliance with regulatory guidance 
the asset liability committee continually monitors our liquidity position 
our sources of funds include the sale of securities in the available for sale portion of the investment portfolio  principal pay downs on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds realized from loans held for sale  brokered deposits and other wholesale funding 
we also secured federal funds borrowing lines from our correspondent bank of million 
our banking centers also provide access to retail deposit markets 
if large certificate depositors shift to our competitors or other markets in response to interest rate changes  we have the ability to replenish those deposits through alternative funding sources 
traditionally  we have also borrowed from the fhlb to supplement our funding requirements 
at december   we had an unused approved line of credit in the amount of million and sufficient collateral available to borrow  approximately  an additional million in advances from the fhlb 
we believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet expected cash needs for the foreseeable future 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to stockholders  repurchase common stock  make selected investments and acquisitions  and service debt 
the main sources of funding for the corporation include dividends from the bank  borrowings and access to the capital markets 
the primary source of funding for the corporation has been dividends and returns of investment from the bank 
kentucky banking laws limit the amount of dividends that may be paid to the corporation by the bank without prior approval of the kofi 
under these laws  the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to current year s net income  as defined in the laws  combined with the retained net income of the preceding two years  less any dividends declared during those periods 
at december   the bank had approximately million of retained earnings that could be used to pay dividends without prior regulatory approval 
because of these limitations  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the corporation 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million to the corporation 
capital stockholders equity increased million during  primarily due to net income earned during the year 
this increase was offset by the repurchase of our own common stock and cash dividends declared during the period 
average stockholders equity to average assets ratio decreased to at december  from at the end of during  we purchased  shares of our own common stock for million 
the repurchase program authorizes the repurchase of  shares from time to time when we believe market conditions are favorable and the repurchase of shares represents a good value 
the repurchase program will remain effective until the number of shares authorized is repurchased or until the program expires september  as of december    shares could be repurchased under the current stock repurchase program 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies has established minimum leverage capital requirements for banks 
banks must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to adjusted average quarterly assets ranging from to  subject to federal bank regulatory evaluation of an organization s overall safety and soundness 
we intend to maintain a capital position that meets or exceeds the well capitalized requirements established for banks by the fdic

off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist of commitments to make loans  unused borrower lines of credit  and stand by letters of credit  which are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
aggregate contractual obligations december  total less than one year greater than one year to years greater than years to years more than years dollars in thousands aggregate contractual obligations time deposits     fhlb borrowings    short term borrowings   subordinated debentures   lease commitments  fhlb borrowings represent the amounts that are due to the fhlb of cincinnati 
these amounts have fixed maturity dates 
four of these borrowings  although fixed  are subject to conversion provisions at the option of the fhlb 
the fhlb has the right to convert these advances to a variable rate or we can prepay the advances at no penalty 
there is a substantial penalty if we prepay the advances before the fhlb exercises its right 
we do not believe these advances will be converted in the near term 
the subordinated debentures  which mature march   are redeemable before the maturity date at our option on or after march  at their principal amount plus accrued interest 
the subordinated debentures are also redeemable in whole or in part from time to time  upon the occurrence of specific events defined within the trust indenture 
the interest rate on the subordinated debentures is at a year fixed rate of adjusting quarterly thereafter at libor plus 
we have the option to defer distributions on the subordinated debentures from time to time for a period not to exceed consecutive quarters 
lease commitments represent the total future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases 
impact of inflation changing prices the financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increasing operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation and changes in prices 
periods of high inflation are often accompanied by relatively higher interest rates  and periods of low inflation are accompanied by relatively lower interest rates 
as market interest rates rise or fall in relation to the rates earned on our loans and investments  the value of these assets decreases or increases respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management and market risk to minimize the volatility of net interest income and exposure to economic loss that may result from fluctuating interest rates  we manage our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by our asset liability committee alco 
the alco  which includes senior management representatives  has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management polices 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in the net interest income as a result of market fluctuations in interest rates 
the alco  on an ongoing basis  monitors interest rate and liquidity risk in order to implement appropriate funding and balance sheet strategies 
management considers interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk 
we utilize an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
we then evaluate potential changes in market interest rates and their subsequent effects on net interest income 
the model projects the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
we also incorporate assumptions based on the historical behavior of our deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates into the model 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely measure future net interest income or precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from the model s simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and the application and timing of various management strategies 
our interest sensitivity profile was asset sensitive at december   compared to a liability sensitive position at december   demonstrating that a larger amount of our interest sensitive assets will re price faster than will our interest sensitive liabilities 
given a sustained basis point decrease in rates  our base net interest income would decrease by an estimated at december  compared to an increase of 
at december  given a basis point increase in interest rates our base net interest income would increase by an estimated at december  compared to a decrease of 
at december  our interest sensitivity at any point in time will be affected by a number of factors 
these factors include the mix of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  their relative pricing schedules  market interest rates  deposit growth  loan growth  decay rates and prepayment speed assumptions 
we use various asset liability strategies to manage the re pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities designed to ensure that exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited within our guidelines of acceptable levels of risk taking 
as demonstrated by the december  and december  sensitivity tables  our balance sheet has an asset sensitive position 
this means that our earning assets  which consist of loans and investment securities  will change in price at a faster rate than our deposits and borrowings 
therefore  if short term interest rates increase  our net interest income will be favorably impacted 
likewise  if short term interest rates decrease  our net interest income will be negatively impacted 
from september through december  the federal open market committee has decreased short term interest rates basis points 
we believe the federal open market committee will likely lower rates several more times before the end of june our net interest margin and the level of net interest income would decrease with a decrease in short term interest rates 
we continually monitor the effects rate changes will have on our level of net interest income  and management works to structure the maturity and pricing of loans and deposits to mitigate large swings in net interest income 
during and  we made efforts to increase the level of short term deposits offering more attractive rates on short term certificates of deposits 
also  during the third quarter of  we paid off a fixed rate fhlb advance that had converted to a variable rate advance 
we replaced this borrowing initially with overnight short term borrowings 
in march  we called our million in subordinated debentures adjustable quarterly at libor plus basis points on march  and we re issued new year cumulative trust preferred securities at a year fixed rate of adjusting quarterly thereafter at libor plus basis points 
in addition  the majority of the newly originated or renewed loans during and were fixed rates loans with the interest rate fixed from three to five years
