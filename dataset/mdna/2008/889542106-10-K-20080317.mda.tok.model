tollgrade designs  engineers  markets and supports test system and status monitoring hardware and software products for the telecommunications and cable industries in the united states and international markets 
the company s telecommunications proprietary test access products enable telecommunications service providers to remotely diagnose problems in plain old telephone service pots lines and digital subscriber lines dsl in public switched telephone network pstn  broadband and next generation internet protocol ip networks 
the company s test system products  specifically the loopcare  tel  celerity  and ltsc centralized test operation support systems oss  together with the associated remote measurement platforms of digitest  ldu  and n x test  enable local exchange carriers to conduct a full range of measurement and fault diagnosis for efficient dispatch of field staff to maintain and repair pots and or dsl services  along with the ability to pre qualify and provide broadband dsl services offerings 
the company s cable products include the cheetah system  a complete cable status monitoring system that provides a comprehensive testing solution for the broadband hybrid fiber coax hfc distribution system 
the status monitoring system consists of a host server for user interface  control and configuration  a headend controller for managing network communications  and transponders that are strategically located within the cable network to gather status reports from power supplies  line amplifiers and fiber optic nodes 
our next generation products can also be upgraded to support voice over internet protocol voip testing capability to enable voice trouble identification in the hfc network 

table of contents on august   the company completed the acquisition of the broadband test division btd of teradyne  inc pursuant to the terms of the acquisition  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of btd for approximately million in cash  and there were approximately million in transaction fees for a total acquisition expenditure of million 
through this acquisition  we significantly expanded our offering of telecommunication test system products 
most recently  the company introduced products targeted at the electric power utility market 
our lighthouse centralized remote monitoring system  which is currently available as a beta product for evaluation pilot programs  and is expected to be commercially available during the fourth quarter of  provides the means for electric power utilities to continuously monitor the distribution grid in order to detect faults and help minimize the impact of outages while optimizing the utilization of assets 
the new product line will enable monitoring  maintenance and reporting functions in real time

copies of our filings are available free of charge to any shareholder of record upon written request to the secretary  tollgrade communications  inc  nixon road  cheswick  pennsylvania products telecommunications test and measurement products our proprietary telecommunications test and measurement products  which include our systems test and mcu products  enable telephone companies to remotely diagnose problems in pots lines as well as qualify and troubleshoot broadband dsl and ip services 
pots lines provide traditional voice service as well as connections for communication devices such as computer modems and fax machines 
pots excludes non switched and private lines  such as data communications service lines  commonly referred to as special services 
pots lines still comprise the vast majority of lines in service today throughout the world 
most dsl lines today provide broadband internet access for residential and business customers  fed from a central or remote office digital subscriber line access multiplexer dslam and configured with either a shared pots voice service or unbundled from the voice switch entirely in the case of a competitive local exchange carriers clecs service offering 
our systems can be used to qualify loops for dsl service as well as ongoing maintenance and repair of these ip lines 
as telecommunications service providers move to all ip networks and services voice  video and data  tollgrade s test systems are positioned to be upgraded to support the testing of these services 
an important aspect of efficiently maintaining a pots and broadband dsl network is the ability to remotely test  diagnose and locate any service affecting problems within the network 
tollgrade s systems test products are made up of a centralized test operating system loopcare  tel  celerity  and ltsc integrated into the customers repair handling database systems  and remote test probes digitest  ldu and n x test located at telephone companies central and remote offices 
these systems enable local exchange carriers to conduct a full range of fault diagnostics in the local loop  the portion of the telephone network that connects end users to the central office 
in addition  line test systems provide the capability to remotely qualify  deploy and maintain services such as dsl and integrated services digital network isdn services which are carried over pots lines 
these test systems reduce the time needed to identify and resolve problems  eliminating or reducing the costs of dispatching a technician to the problem site 
most pots line test systems  however  were designed only for use over copper wire line  as a result  traditional test systems could not access local loops in which fiber optic technology had been introduced 
our legacy mcu  which is used primarily by regional bell operating companies rbocs  solved this problem  extending loopcare testing from the central office to the fiber fed remote digital loop carrier dlc lines by mimicking a digital bypass pair  which is essentially a telephone circuit that connects central test and measurement devices to the copper circuits close to the customer  ie the last mile 
we believe our digitest system represents the future of telecommunication network testing  combining our line test system with a next generation test platform to provide a complete test system solution for pots and dsl local loop prequalification and in service testing 

table of contents systems test products our systems test product family includes four separate operating systems loopcare  tel  celerity  and ltsc  each having an established installed base 
loopcare is also the primary application for broadband dsl testing and can be architected to overlay tel and ltsc to add this functionality to the existing line test application with the addition of the digitest measurement platform 
loopcare has remained the major oss utilized by rbocs for over twenty five years to test the integrity and quality of their pots network infrastructure 
the loopcare oss  which we offer both as part of the digitest system and as a stand alone software product that can interface with other test heads on the market  currently manages testing operations for more than of the copper pairs in the united states  and is the qualification  installation and maintenance tool used to troubleshoot more than million pots  isdn and dsl subscribers worldwide 
also included in our systems test products is our digitest product family 
our digitest product family  which includes loopcare  digitest edge  digitest hub  and  for  digitest ice  performs physical and logical measurements to verify the connection performance of copper pots lines and broadband dsl circuits and reports those measurements to our loopcare oss 
the loopcare oss  in turn  analyzes that measurement data and creates an easy to understand fault description 
at the same time  the loopcare system can generate a dispatch to a work center so that a repairman can fix the problem 
the digitest product family can also serve as a replacement for aging loop test system lts equipment deployed in current us pots networks 
in addition  loopcare and the digitest product family can be used to pre qualify  verify installation  and remotely isolate troubles for various dsl services  including testing the logical layers to verify modem synchronization in to the dslam or out to the customer 
digitest edge provides a global platform for pots and broadband test applications  by combining a narrowband and wideband metallic testing platform with a multi layered dsl service assurance platform 
these test capabilities  when managed by our loopcare oss  enable service providers to accurately isolate a dsl problem between the customer s premises  the local exchange carrier s local loop and dslam serving network  and the internet service provider s data network 
our digitest product family also includes the digitest hub  a central office test platform designed to support multiple testing environments 
the digitest hub addresses emerging broadband testing requirements  but also retains interfaces to legacy equipment  allowing for a seamless migration from traditional to packet based delivery of services and allowing service providers to continue automated  mass market processes 
the digitest hub has been deployed extensively in one of the company s large international contracts 
although approved for use with several domestic carriers  sales of the product have been minimal in us markets thus far 
our most recent addition to the digitest product family is the digitest ice  which was introduced on a limited basis internationally in the first quarter of  and is expected to become generally available during the second quarter of optimized for deployment at remote dslam locations  ice provides both metallic and multi layered dsl testing to help service providers install and maintain broadband triple play services within their emerging fttx networks 
during  we added the n x test ltsc family of products to our systems test product portfolio through an acquisition of certain assets from emerson  these hardware and software products  along with their accessories and enhancements  electrically measure the characteristics of copper loops and report those results in the form of a fault description which can be used by an operation to direct required repair work on a more focused basis 
these products are deployed primarily in the europe  the middle east and africa emea geographical area 
on august   we acquired the btd business and its family of ldu hardware and tel and celerity software products from teradyne  inc these products perform many of the same line test functions and test measurements as loopcare and digitest previously discussed  but these products have been optimized for operation in the international markets  and have been deployed extensively in large telephone networks in europe  covering over million access lines 
these products have also been deployed to a lesser scale in north america  as well as targeted deployments in international markets outside of europe 
we have original equipment manufacturer oem agreements in place for the supply of a communications card for our digitest edge product and for the supply of an access device for that product line 
both of these agreements contain automatic renewal terms  unless earlier terminated 
we are also a party to a number of third party software license agreements that allow us to incorporate third party software products and features into our loopcare and celerity software 

table of contents we have licensing arrangements with aware  inc for certain technology related to our digitest products and pay royalties and license fees for the use of such technology on a fixed per unit basis 
this license agreement with aware contains automatic renewal terms  unless earlier terminated 
we market and sell our systems test products primarily through our direct sales force as well as through certain reseller and distributor agreements 
sales of the digitests product line including related software sales accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also offer for sale new loopcare features to existing customers and the base loopcare oss as a stand alone product to clecs for use with test heads other than our digitest hardware 
sales of stand alone loopcare software and enhancements accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
mcu our legacy mcu products plug into dlc systems  the large network transmission systems used by telephone companies to link the copper and fiber optic portions of the local loop 
mcu products allow our customers to extend their line testing capabilities to all of their pots lines served by a dlc system regardless of whether the system is fed by a copper or fiber optic link 
dlc systems  which are located at telephone companies central offices and at remote sites within local user areas  effectively multiplex the services of a single fiber optic line into multiple copper lines 
in many instances  several dlc systems are located at a single remote site to create multiple local loops that serve several thousand different end user homes and businesses 
generally  for every dlc remote site  customers will deploy at least two mcu line testing products 
we market and sell our mcu products directly to customers as well as through certain oem agreements 
we also have certain royalty based license agreements in place to enable us to maintain capability with specific dlc systems 
we paid royalties under these agreements in the amounts of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales of mcu products and related hardware accounted for approximately  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cable testing products the company s cheetah performance and status monitoring products provide a broad network assurance solution for the broadband hfc distribution system found in the cable television industry 
our cheetah products gather status information and report on critical components within the cable network 
cheetah cable monitoring the company s monitoring systems include complete hardware and software solutions that enable efficient hfc plant status monitoring 
by providing a constant  proactive view of the health and status of outside plant transmission systems  the products can reduce operating costs and increase subscriber satisfaction 
our cable offerings consist of cheetahxd broadband assurance software  our proprietary cheetahnet formerly netmentor software systems  maintenance  head end controllers  return path switch hardware  both proprietary and docsis based transponders and other equipment which gather status and performance reports from power supplies  line amplifiers and fiber optic nodes 
we have entered into license agreements with c cor  alpha technologies  inc alpha  and general instrument corp 
d b a the broadband communications sector of motorola  inc  through which we provide status monitoring transponder technology incorporated into those companies cable network management systems 
we have a separate agreement with alpha  the leading supplier of power management products to the cable industry  to serve as a non exclusive provider of ip based  docsis based status monitoring equipment for its power supply systems 
this agreement automatically renews on an annual basis unless terminated by either party 
we also have a number of third party software license agreements that allow us to incorporate third party software products and features into our cheetah product offerings 
we have licensing arrangements with telchemy incorporated  wind river systems  inc and adventnet  inc 
for certain technology related to our cable products and pay royalties and license fees for the use of such technology on a fixed per unit basis 

table of contents cheetahip hfc service assurance our cheetahip hfc service assurance solution allows cable operators to proactively test and monitor voip using hardware test probes and software analysis tools 
by layering voip test point software on to docsis based transponders  the hfc access network is populated with a tollgrade test probe that is controlled by the cheetahxd management system  placing active on demand and batch voip test calls point to point across the network for remote fault diagnosis 
our cheetah ip service assurance products  which were initially announced in june  have been met with limited market acceptance thus far 
in connection with the establishment of a distribution channel for this technology  we have entered into agreements with brix networks  inc and tektronix successor to minacom  which expire in and  respectively  and which contain automatic renewal provisions 
sales activity in  both through established third party channels  and on a direct basis  has been minimal  however  we continue to market and offer for sale this suite of products 
sales of both the cheetah status monitoring and ip hfc service assurance product lines excluding services accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
electric utility monitoring products the company s new product development effort  the lighthouse product line  is being designed to provide power grid monitoring capabilities to electric utilities 
research and investment throughout enabled a launch of the product line for specific beta customer opportunities in the beginning of the test system solution currently consists of line mounted sensors  aggregators  and centralized software providing an end to end solution for power providers to efficiently monitor their overhead distribution circuits in real time 
a lighthouse sensor  mounted directly on the electrical conductor  will continuously monitor key circuit parameters and transmit data over a wireless network to a central location  reducing time of detecting a problem on the grid  identifying its location and restoring service 
lighthouse is intended as an innovative means for electric power utilities to deploy technology to provide real time grid intelligence to detect faults and help minimize the impact of outages while optimizing the utilization of assets 
the ultimate goal of the system is to improve the overall efficiency of energy delivery  improve customer satisfaction and improve the financial performance of the electric utilities 
the company had no revenue in from these products  which are expected to be generally available in the fourth quarter of services our services offerings include software maintenance as well as our professional services  which are designed to ensure that all of the components of our customers test systems operate properly 
including software maintenance  services revenue accounted for approximately  and of the company s revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our services business has shifted away from traditional pots based testability services toward more contract based software maintenance services  the revenue from which is more predictable 
for  the services business was comprised primarily of software maintenance agreements  and was expanded considerably with the btd acquisition 
as a result  we expect services to comprise a larger percentage of our revenue in the future 
the primary customers for our services offerings are the rbocs  domestically  and international customers 
operating segment we have determined that our business has one operating segment  test assurance 
all product sales relate to the business of testing infrastructure and networks for the telecommunications and cable industries 
our products have similar production processes  and are sold through comparable distribution channels and means to similar types and classes of customers already in  or entering into  the telecommunications and cable businesses 
operating results are regularly reviewed by the company s chief operating decision maker regarding decisions about the allocation of resources and to assess performance 
sales and competition with our headquarters in cheswick  pennsylvania  we market our products and services primarily through our direct sales organization with offices in cheswick  pennsylvania 
additionally  we have a channel of oems  value added resellers and distributors  both domestic and international 
revenue concentrations the primary customers for our products and services are the rbocs verizon communications  inc  at t  inc 
and qwest communications international  inc  as well as independent international telephone companies and most of the major domestic cable operators 
sales in   and to at t including the former bellsouth corporation accounted for approximately  
table of contents  and  respectively  of our total revenue for these years 
sales generated from rboc customers were  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
although the rboc customers currently focus their spending in more aggressively in wireless and access technologies  our proportional revenue from rbocs has remained relatively stable 
meanwhile  our proportional revenues from international sales have increased 
sales to one cable oem customer  alpha  were of our total revenue in sales to our telecom oem customer  lucent technologies international  inc  were of total revenue in because of our continued dependency on certain rbocs and certain significant cable multiple system operators msos and oems  the potential loss of one or more of these customers  or the reduction of orders for our products by one or more of these customers  could materially and adversely affect our results 
we distinguish revenue by geographic area based upon customer location 
domestic sales represented approximately   and of the company s total revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
international sales represented approximately of the company s total revenue for the year ended december   compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to sales related to the company s purchase of btd acquired from teradyne  inc on august  and the deployment of products into saudi arabia  offset  in part  by a decrease in our deployment of products into south africa and certain european accounts 
our international sales are primarily in three geographic areas the americas excluding the united states of america  europe  the middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific 
sales for the americas  excluding the united states of america  were approximately million or of international sales  sales for emea were million or of international sales and sales in asia pacific were million or of international sales for the year ended december  sales for the americas  excluding the united states of america  were approximately million or of international sales  sales for emea were million or of international sales and sales in asia pacific were million or of international sales for the year ended december  see the discussion in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this form k for a further description of our international sales strategies 
competitive conditions the market for telecommunications and cable testing equipment is highly competitive 
primary competitive factors in the company s market include price  product features  performance  reliability  service and support  breadth of product line  technical documentation  prompt delivery and the availability of alternative technologies 
the traditional competitors for our pots telecommunications products include fluke corporation formerly harris corporation  and nortel 
each of these companies provides centralized test and management solutions for pots networks 
historically  we have successfully positioned ourselves against these offerings by leveraging our patented technologies  entering into partnerships with telecommunications equipment providers  and investing in ongoing research and development for emerging broadband technologies and applications 
our competitors for broadband technologies and applications include spirent communications plc  huawei technologies co  ltd  jds uniphase  and exfo electro optical engineering inc our strategy is to leverage our existing incumbent infrastructure and core competencies to test these broadband next generation networks  in order to position ourselves to compete against these competitors on the basis of lower upfront deployment costs and long term operational efficiency 
we also face competition as network equipment providers such as alcatel lucent  occam networks  inc and tellabs inc 
offer testing technology in the form of a chipset embedded into their products 
where testing was once only available in the form of multi chip  circuit board based designs like those found in our remote test system products  integrated testing technology is now available in low cost chipsets embedded into the products of these network equipment providers 
referred to as selt delt single ended line test or double ended line test  the testing technology available in this form has limited functionality and only provides partial views of faults in the network 
as such  we continue to believe that more robust testing technology like that offered in our products should be important for network assurance as the next generation network evolves and increased penetration of triple play services occurs 
however  we have and will continue to face competition and downward pricing pressure from the availability of these less expensive  less robust alternatives resulting in decreased sales of our system products to certain of our customers  particularly in the clec market 
with respect to our cable products  status performance monitoring competitors include am communications  inc  cisco systems inc 
formerly scientific atlanta  inc  alpha and electroline equipment inc through the adoption of open  non proprietary standards for status performance monitoring systems  such as hybrid management sub layer hms and docsis  this market has become highly competitive 
pricing pressures have increased as all providers of monitoring transponders and associated software have reduced price points to meet customer demands 
during  alpha introduced a docsis based transponder which competes 
table of contents with the products we supply to the market both directly and through our supply agreement with alpha 
as a result  we have modified our strategies in an attempt to reduce product costs while increasing cooperation with alpha channel relationships 
as with the telecommunications products  the extension of our cable products to address internet protocol test applications expands our list of traditional competitors to now include empirix inc  jds uniphase  tektronix canada inc  brix networks  inc 
and agilent technologies inc manufacturing our manufacturing operations consist primarily of quality control  functional testing  final assembly  burn in and shipping 
we are iso registered with the british standards institution  inc iso is a harmonized set of standards that define quality assurance management 
written by the international organization for standardization iso  iso is recognized throughout the united states  canada  the european union and japan 
to be registered  the company develops and maintains internal documentation and processes to support the production of quality products to ensure customer satisfaction 
for our telephony products  we utilize two key independent subcontractors to perform a majority of the circuit board assembly and in circuit testing work 
for our cheetah hardware  during  we primarily used a single turnkey manufacturer  bulova technologies ems  llc formerly  dictaphone corporation s electronic manufacturing services division  a wholly owned subsidiary of bulova technologies  llc  to procure the components and assemble and test the products 
the loss of any of these subcontractors or inability of such subcontractors to meet our manufacturing needs could cause delays in our ability to meet our customers orders and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  shortages of raw materials delivered to  or production capacity constraints at  the company s subcontractors could negatively affect our ability to meet our production obligations and result in increased prices for affected parts 
any such reduction may result in delays in shipments of the company s products or increases in the price of components  either of which could have a material adverse impact on us 
during  we purchased raw materials from one of our contract manufacturers in order to provide it with temporary liquidity  and  in  we purchased additional raw materials on behalf of this contract manufacturer to help ensure timely product deliveries 
we had expected this contract manufacturer to return to full turn key vendor status in  but it did not 
the company will transition to two new contract manufacturers in its place  and we expect this transition to be complete by the end of the second quarter of generally  our products use industry standard components  however  application specific integrated circuits asics are also a key component of some of our products and are custom made to the company s specifications 
although we have generally been able to obtain asics on a timely basis  a delay in the delivery of these components could have a material adverse impact on the company 
product and technology development our product development personnel are organized into teams dedicated to one or more specific product lines or technologies 
we continuously monitor developing technologies in order to introduce new or improved products as defined standards and markets emerge 
during  we engaged in limited research and development and product trial activities in the wireless hotspot market  however  based on our strategic focus on our core test and measurement capabilities and expertise  we determined not to further pursue activities in this market 
in  we continued to investigate the development of new applications for our telecommunications and cable technologies  as well as to develop enhancements and new features to our loopcare software product line  digitest hardware and other technologies to service the telecommunications and cable industries 
consistent with our strategy  during  we also developed technology for use in power grid monitoring for use by electric utility companies 
for the years ended december   and  research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively

we have obtained nine patents in the united states  one patent in taiwan  one patent in europe  one patent in the united kingdom and three patents in canada on other telecommunications technology with expiration dates ranging from to in connection with our acquisition of btd  we obtained numerous patents  which included twenty one patents in the united states  two patents in canada  four patents in europe and the united kingdom and five patents in belgium  germany  france  spain  the netherlands and italy with expiration dates ranging from to in addition  we have nineteen united states  seventeen canadian  twelve european and five international  four japanese and two chinese patent applications pending on our products  many of which were obtained in connection with our acquisition of btd 
we will seek additional patents from time to time related to our research and development activities 
we protect our trademarks  patents  inventions  trade secrets  and other proprietary rights by contract  trademark  copyright and patent registration  and internal security 
although we believe that these patents in the aggregate are an important element of our business  we do not believe that our business  as a whole  is materially dependent on any one patent 
backlog the company s order backlog for firm customer purchase orders and signed software maintenance contracts was million at december   compared to backlog of million at december  the order backlog at december  includes approximately million of the newly acquired btd products and services 
further  the backlog at december  and december  included approximately million and million  respectively  related to software maintenance contracts  including acquired btd maintenance agreements reflected in the backlog  which is primarily earned and recognized as income on a straight line basis during the remaining terms of these agreements 
we expect the revenues related to the entire backlog at december  to be recognized in we currently have loopcare software maintenance agreements with all of the rbocs 
one of the agreements was extended beyond december  on february  for a two year period expiring on december  a second agreement expires on december   while a third extends through the fourth  which was signed in january  expires on december  we also have a number of agreements in force covering tel and celerity  and we have several arrangements in place for our cable software products 
as discussed above  our backlog at december  and included approximately million and million respectively  related to software maintenance agreements 
we have adopted a policy to include a maximum of twelve months revenue from multi year software maintenance agreements in reported backlog 
software maintenance revenue is deemed to be earned and recognized as income on a straight line basis over the terms of the underlying agreements 
periodic fluctuations in customer orders and backlog result from a variety of factors  including but not limited to the timing of significant orders and shipments 
although these fluctuations could impact short term results  they are not necessarily indicative of long term trends in sales of our products 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  of whom were located in the united states and of whom were located in europe 
in the first quarter of  tollgrade began to implement initiatives as part of a strategic plan aimed at increasing efficiency and reducing cost  which is discussed in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
as part of this initiative  the company eliminated approximately positions and an additional positions are being reassigned to new projects

risk factors we wish to caution each reader of this form k to consider the following factors and other factors discussed herein and in other past reports  including but not limited to prior year form k and quarterly form q reports filed with the sec 
our business and results of operations could be materially affected by any of the following risks 
the factors discussed herein are not exhaustive 
therefore  the factors contained herein should be read together with other reports and documents that we file with the sec from time to time  which may supplement  modify  supersede or update the factors listed in this document 
our strategic focus on our core test and measurement competencies and cost reduction plans may be ineffective or may limit our ability to compete 
in the first quarter of  we began to implement a series of initiatives designed to increase efficiency and reduce costs and to focus our core business on our test and measurement expertise 
these initiatives included reductions of staff  alignment of investments and a completion of the integration plans from recent acquisitions  including emerson and btd 
while we believe that these actions will reduce costs  they may not be sufficient to achieve the required operational efficiencies that will enable us to respond more quickly to changes in the market or result in the improvements in our business that we anticipate 
in such event  we may be forced to take additional cost reducing initiatives  which may negatively impact quarterly earnings and profitability as we account for severance and other related costs 
in addition  there is the risk that such measures could have long term effects on our business by reducing our pool of talent  decreasing or slowing improvements in our products  making it more difficult for us to respond to customers  limiting our ability to increase production quickly if and when the demand for our products increases and limiting our ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause our earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
we are dependent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate our key personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate our key management personnel  including the company s ceo and cfo  and key engineers  necessary to implement our business plan and to grow our business 
despite the adverse economic conditions of the past several years  competition for certain specific technical and management skill sets is intense 
if we are unable to identify and hire the personnel that we need to succeed  or if one or more of our present key employees were to cease to be associated with the company  our future results could be adversely affected 
furthermore  we have recently experienced a number of changes in our senior management positions  both as part of the restructuring initiatives and otherwise 
although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to address the impact of these changes  there is the risk that such changes could impact our business  which could negatively affect operating results 
we depend upon a few major customers for a majority of our revenues  and the loss of any of these customers  or the substantial reduction in the products that they purchase from us  would significantly reduce our revenues and net income 
we currently depend upon a few major customers for a significant portion of our revenues and we expect to continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers in the future 
the loss of any of these customers or a substantial reduction in the products that they purchase from us would significantly reduce our revenues and net income 
furthermore  diversions in the capital spending of certain of these customers to new network elements have and could continue to lead to their reduced demand for our products  which could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business and results of operation 
the capital spending of our rboc customers  as well as many of our other customers and potential customers  are dictated by a number of factors  most of which are beyond our control  including the conditions of the communications market and the economy in general  subscriber line loss and related reduced demand for wireline telecommunications services  
table of contents changes or shifts in the technology utilized in the networks  labor disputes between our customers and their collective bargaining units  the failure of our customers to meet established purchase forecasts and growth projections  competition among the rbocs  competitive exchange carriers and wireless telecommunications and cable providers  and reorganizations  including management changes  at one or more of our customers or potential customers 
if the financial condition of one or more of our major customers should deteriorate  or if they have difficulty acquiring investment capital due to any of these or other factors  a substantial decrease in our revenues would likely result 
our operating results may vary from quarter to quarter  causing our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have in the past been subject to quarter to quarter fluctuations  and we expect that these fluctuations will continue  and may increase in magnitude  in future periods 
demand for our products is driven by many factors  including the availability of funding for our products in customers capital budgets 
there is a trend for some of our customers to place large orders near the end of a quarter or fiscal year  in part to spend remaining available capital budget funds 
seasonal fluctuations in customer demand for our products driven by budgetary and other reasons can create corresponding fluctuations in period to period revenues  and we therefore cannot assure you that our results in one period are necessarily indicative of our revenues in any future period 
in addition  the number and timing of large individual sales and the ability to obtain acceptances of those sales  where applicable  has been difficult for us to predict  and large individual sales have  in some cases  occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated  or have not occurred at all 
the loss or deferral of one or more significant sales in a quarter could harm our operating results 
it is possible that in some quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in such events  or in the event adverse conditions prevail  the market price of our common stock may decline significantly 
we may experience reduced product sales caused by customers transitioning their access network service assurance solutions 
certain of our larger customers are in the process of upgrading their access networks  and continue transitioning and upgrading their service assurance solutions for these networks 
this has and may continue to adversely impact revenues from our testing products 
further  these customers may decide not to adopt our technologies for their service assurance needs  which would have a significant adverse affect on revenues for those products 
our services business is subject to a trend of reduced capital spending for our products by our major customers 
our services business  which includes software maintenance as well as professional services  is sensitive to the decline in our rboc customers capital investment in their traditional voice services  which tends to drive the professional services 
furthermore  the timing of the extension or renewal of certain of the more significant software maintenance agreements can have a major impact on the company s services revenues for any particular fiscal quarter or year 
we are also experiencing intense pricing pressure from many of our larger software maintenance customers  as they continue to attempt to reduce their own internal costs 
accordingly  our ability to maintain historical levels from traditional sources or increase levels of services revenues cannot be assured  and in fact  such levels may continue to decrease 
we have completed  and may pursue additional acquisitions  which could result in the disruption of our current business  difficulties related to the integration of acquired businesses  and substantial expenditures 
we have completed  and we may pursue additional acquisitions of companies  product lines and technologies as part of our strategic efforts to realign our resources around growth opportunities in current  adjacent and new markets  to enhance our existing products  to introduce new products and to fulfill changing customer requirements 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including the disruption of our business  exposure to assumed or unknown liabilities of the acquired target  and the failure to integrate successfully the operations and products of acquired businesses 
international acquisitions provide specific challenges due to the unique topology of international telecommunications networks  as well as requirements of doing business in particular countries 
further  our ability to sell certain products internationally depends upon our ability to maintain certain key manufacturing relationships and we may not be able to continue those relationships 
goodwill arising from acquisitions may result in significant impairment charges against our operating results in one or more future periods 
furthermore  we may never achieve the anticipated results or benefits of an acquisition  such as increased market share or the successful development and sales of a new product 
the effects of any of these risks could materially harm our business and reduce our future results of operations 
on august  we acquired the broadband test division of teradyne  inc in addition to the general risks discussed above  the successful completion of the integration of this business remains subject to the risks that we may be unable to secure key relationships 
table of contents with key suppliers and customers of the broadband test division  execute agreements with new customers or close international opportunities due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in international markets which are important to the acquired business 
in addition  we may experience difficulties in gaining market acceptance of our products in the international customer base of the acquired business 
the failure of acquired assets to meet expectations  or a decline in our fair value determined by market prices of our stock  could indicate impairment of our intangible assets and result in impairment charges 
the carrying value of certain of our intangible assets could become impaired by changing market conditions 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas requires goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives to be measured for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we perform annual impairment tests as of december of each year 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit and test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the company s equity  which we estimate based on the quoted market price of our common stock and an estimated control premium  to the company s book value 
the testing completed at december  resulted in the total impairment of goodwill and partial impairment of certain indefinite lived intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and requires that these assets be measured for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
based on our assessment that a triggering event had occurred  we performed the required recoverability tests of sfas at december  and determined that certain long lived assets were impaired 
the occurrence of further triggering events could result in additional impairments 
the sale of our products is dependent upon our ability to satisfy the proprietary requirements of our customers 
we depend upon a relatively narrow range of products for the majority of our revenue 
our success in marketing our products is dependent upon their continued acceptance by our customers 
in some cases  our customers require that our products meet their own proprietary requirements 
if we are unable to satisfy such requirements  or forecast and adapt to changes in such requirements  our business could be materially harmed 
in addition  we plan to introduce certain new products in the first quarter of the introduction of such products has been delayed as compared with our prior expectations 
the introduction of such products in the first quarter of and their rate of acceptance could be further delayed by  among other factors  extended testing or acceptance periods  requests for custom or modified engineering of such products to conform to customer requirements 
the sale of our products is dependent on our ability to respond to rapid technological change  including evolving industry wide standards  and may be adversely affected by the development  and acceptance by our customers  of new technologies which may compete with or reduce the demand for our products 
rapid technological change  including evolving industry standards  could render our products obsolete 
sales of our legacy cable products are declining  and demand for these products may further decline or be eliminated  as the market for these products transitions to industry wide standards  such as the hms and docsis cable standards 
furthermore  standards for new services and technologies continue to evolve  requiring us to continually modify our products or to develop new versions to meet these new standards 
certain of these certifications are limited in scope  which may require that the product be recertified if any modifications to hardware or firmware are made 
if we are unable to forecast the demand for  or develop new products or adapt our existing products to meet  these evolving standards and other technological innovations  or if our products and services do not gain the acceptance of our customers  our overall revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
in addition  changes in network architecture experienced by our customers in the tier and telephony market have and may continue to negatively affect our ability to sell products in these markets 
although we are addressing these changes with modifications to our existing products  if customers do not accept this new product technology  our revenues could be adversely affected 
in addition  the development of new technologies which compete with or reduce the demand for our products  and the adoption of such technologies by our customers  could adversely affect sales of our products 
for example  as our products generally serve the wireline marketplace  to the extent wireline customers migrate to wireless technologies  there may be reduced demand for our products 
in addition  we face new competition as testing functions that were once only available with purpose built test systems are now available as integrated components of network elements 
to the extent our customers adopt such new technology in place of our telecommunications products  the sales of our telecommunications products may be adversely affected 
such competition may also increase pricing pressure for our telecommunications products and adversely affect the revenues from such products 

table of contents our reliance on third parties to manufacture certain aspects of our products involves risks  including delays in product shipments and reduced control over product quality 
we depend upon a limited number of third party contract manufacturers to manufacture certain elements of our products  and will transition to two new contract manufacturers in furthermore  the components of our hardware products are procured from a limited number of outside suppliers 
although our products generally use industry standard products  some parts  such as asics  are custom made to our specifications 
our reliance upon such third party contractors involve several risks  including reduced control over manufacturing costs  delivery times  reliability and quality of components 
if we were to encounter a shortage of key manufacturing components from limited sources of supply  or experience manufacturing delays caused by reduced manufacturing capacity  inability of our contract manufacturers to procure raw materials  integration issues related to our acquisition of the broadband test division  the loss of key assembly subcontractors  difficulties associated with the transition to our new contract manufacturers or other factors  we could experience lost revenues  increased costs  delays in  cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments  any of which would materially harm our business 
our future sales in international markets are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
as a result of our recent btd acquisition and domestic market conditions  our business is becoming more dependent upon international markets 
our future sales in international markets are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including local economic and labor conditions  political instability including terrorism and other acts of war or hostility  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment  trade protection measures  tax laws  our ability to market current or develop new products suitable for international markets  difficulties with deployments and acceptances of products  obtaining and maintaining successful distribution and resale channels  changes in tariffs and foreign currency exchange rates  and longer payment cycles 
these specific risks  or an overall reduction in the demand for or the sales of our products in international markets  could adversely affect future results 
we face intense competition  which could result in our losing market share or experiencing a decline in our gross margins 
the markets for some of our products are very competitive 
some of our competitors have greater technological  financial  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and personnel resources than we have 
as a result  these competitors may have an advantage in responding more rapidly or effectively to changes in industry standards or technologies 
competition is particularly intense in the cable markets  due to the introduction of the docsis standard  which allows customers to purchase system components from multiple vendors 
we are also facing competition with our ip based testing solutions  and many competitive technologies  encompassing both hardware and software  are available in these markets 
moreover  better financed competitors may be better able to withstand the pricing pressures that increased competition may bring 
if our introduction of improved products or services is not timely or well received  or if our competitors reduce their prices for products that are comparable to ours  demand for our products and services could be adversely affected 
recent competition from certain network element providers offering chip based testing functionality may also intensify the pricing pressure for our telecommunications products and adversely affect future revenues from such products 
we also face increasing pressure from certain of our rboc customers on software maintenance agreements  as they continue to divert spending from legacy networks to next generation network elements 
we may also compete directly with our customers 
generally  we sell our products either directly or indirectly through oem channels and other means to end user telecommunications and cable television providers 
it is possible that our customers  as the result of bankruptcy or other rationales for dismantling network equipment  could attempt to resell our products 
the successful development of such a secondary market for our products by a third party could negatively affect demand for our products  reducing our future revenues 
our future results are dependent on our ability to establish  maintain and expand our distribution channels and our existing third party distributors 
we market and sell certain of our products  including our digitest and cheetah product lines and certain of the newly acquired broadband test division products  through domestic and international oem relationships 
our future results are dependent on our ability to establish  maintain and expand third party relationships with oem as well as other marketing and sales distribution channels 
if  however  the third parties with whom we have entered into such oem and other arrangements should fail to meet their contractual obligations  cease doing  or reduce the amount of their business with us or otherwise fail to meet their own performance objectives  customer demand for our products could be adversely affected  which would have an adverse effect on our revenues 
the sales cycle for our system products is long  and the delay or failure to complete one or more large transactions in a quarter could cause our operating results to fall below our expectations 
the sales cycle for our system products is highly customer specific and can vary from a few weeks to many months 
the system requirements of customers is highly dependent on many factors  including but not limited to their projections of business growth  
table of contents capital budgets and anticipated cost savings from implementation of the system 
our delay or failure to complete one or more large transactions in a quarter could harm our operating results 
our systems involve significant capital commitments by customers 
potential customers generally commit significant resources to an evaluation of available enterprise software and system testing solutions and require us to expend substantial time  effort and money educating them about the value of our solutions 
system sales often require an extensive sales effort throughout a customer s organization because decisions to acquire software licenses and associated system hardware involve the evaluation of the products by a significant number of customer personnel in various functional and geographic areas  each often having specific and conflicting requirements 
a variety of factors  including actions by competitors and other factors over which we have little or no control  may cause potential customers to favor a particular supplier or to delay or forego a purchase 
many of the company s products must comply with significant governmental and industry based regulations  certifications  standards and protocols  some of which evolve as new technologies are deployed 
compliance with such regulations  certifications  standards and protocols may prove costly and time consuming for the company  and the company cannot provide assurance that its products will continue to meet these standards in the future 
in addition  regulatory compliance may present barriers to entry in particular markets or reduce the profitability of the company s product offerings 
such regulations  certifications  standards and protocols may also adversely affect the industries in which we compete  limit the number of potential customers for the company s products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply  or delays in compliance  with such regulations  standards and protocols or delays in receipt of such certifications could delay the introduction of new products or cause the company s existing products to become obsolete 
we depend on sales of our mcu products for a meaningful portion of our revenues  but this product is mature and its sales will continue to decline 
a large portion of our sales have historically been attributable to our mcu products 
we expect that our mcu products may continue to account for a meaningful percentage of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  these sales are declining 
mcu sales largely depend upon the rate of deployment of new  and the retrofitting of existing  dlc systems in the united states 
installation and replacement of dlc systems are  in turn  driven by a number of factors  including the availability of capital resources and the demand for new or better pots 
our customers have begun to implement next generation network improvements such as fiber to the premises fttp  which do not require the use of our mcu products as does the present hybrid pots network 
if our major customers fail to continue to build out their dsl networks and other projects requiring dlc deployments  or if we otherwise satisfy the domestic telecommunications market s demand for mcus  our mcu sales will continue to decline and our future results would be materially and adversely affected 
although we are unable to predict future prices for our mcu products  we expect that prices for these products will continue to be subject to significant downward pressure in certain markets for the reasons described above 
accordingly  our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be dependent on our ability to expand our customer base  increase unit sales volumes of these products and to successfully  develop  introduce and sell new products such as our cable and software products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our customer base  increase unit sales volumes of existing products or develop  introduce and or sell new products 
our continued emphasis on our network assurance and testing solutions and cable status monitoring products  and on software products in particular  could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
we are actively engaged in research to improve and expand our cable products  including research and development to reduce product costs while providing enhancements  however  with the rise of industry wide standards  among other factors  our cable products have lower margins than our telephony test system products 
if sales of our network assurance and testing solutions and cable status monitoring products do not increase or are not accepted in the marketplace  or if our research and development activities do not produce marketable products that are both competitive and accepted by our customers  our overall revenues and profitability will be adversely affected 
in addition  although software products generally generate higher margin returns for us than our hardware products  the initial development costs of software applications  coupled with the inherent problems with pricing software  can make it difficult to assess the potential profitability of new software products 
unless we acquire software  we must internally develop any new software products  which can be a relatively expensive and lengthy process  particularly for proprietary software products 
in addition  because it is customary in our industry to sell perpetual enterprise licenses that cover an entire customer s operations  it can be difficult to assess at the time of sale the exact price that we should charge for a particular license 
another emerging risk to our software development efforts is the presence of available open source software  which can allow our competitors and or our customers to piece together a non proprietary software solution relatively quickly 
to the extent they are successful in developing software that meets their feature and benefit needs  revenue from our proprietary software could be adversely 
table of contents affected 
further  to the extent we incorporate open source into our software products  our ability to maximize revenue from our software products could be adversely impacted 
if our new development efforts fail to result in products which meet our customers needs  or if our customers fail to accept our new products  our revenues will be adversely affected 
we have recently introduced on a limited basis our lighthouse centralized remote monitoring system for the electric utility industry 
the product is currently in beta trials and is expected to be generally available in the fourth quarter of the successful development  introduction and commercial success of this new technology will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to meet customer requirements  the existence of competitive products in the market  our timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and manufacturing processes  our ability to meet product cost targets generating acceptable margins  timely remediation of product performance issues  if any  identified during testing  product performance at customer locations  differentiation of our product from our competitors products  and management of customer expectations concerning product capabilities and life cycles 
our customers are subject to an evolving governmental regulatory environment that could significantly reduce the demand for our products or increase our costs of doing business 
our customers have historically been subject to a number of governmental regulations  many of which have been repealed or amended as a result of the passage of the telecommunications act of deregulatory efforts have affected and likely will continue to affect our customers in several ways  including the introduction of competitive forces into the local telephone markets and the imposition or removal of controls on the pricing of services 
these and other regulatory changes may limit the scope of our customers deployments of future services and budgets for capital expenditures  which could significantly reduce the demand for our products 
moreover  as the fcc adopts new and amends existing regulations  and as the courts analyze the fcc s authority to do so  our customers cannot accurately predict the rules which will regulate their conduct in their respective markets 
changes in the telecommunications regulatory environment could  among other results  increase our costs of doing business  require our customers to share assets with competitors or prevent the company or our customers from engaging in business activities they may wish to conduct  which could adversely affect our future results 
our limited ability to protect our proprietary information and technology may adversely affect our ability to compete  and our products could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  resulting in claims against us the results of which could be costly 
many of our products consist entirely or partly of proprietary technology owned by us 
although we seek to protect our technology through a combination of copyrights  trade secret laws  contractual obligations and patents  these protections may not be sufficient to prevent the wrongful appropriation of our intellectual property  nor will they prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in order to defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products from third party infringement  we may be required to institute legal proceedings 
if we are unable to successfully assert and defend our proprietary rights in the technology utilized in our products  our future results could be adversely affected 
although we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our product development efforts  we may become subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
any claims relating to the infringement of third party proprietary rights  even if not meritorious  could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  require us to reengineer or cease sales of our products or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us 
in addition  parties making claims may be able to obtain an injunction  which could prevent us from selling our products in the united states or abroad 
the success of some of our products is dependent on our ability to maintain licenses to technology from the manufacturers of systems with which our products must be compatible 
some of our products require that we license technology from manufacturers of systems with which our products must be compatible 
the success of our proprietary mcu products  in particular  rely upon our ability to acquire and maintain licensing arrangements with the various manufacturers of dlc systems for the proprietary design integrated circuits pdics unique to each 
although most of our pdic licensing agreements have perpetual renewal terms  all of them can be terminated by either party 
if we are unable to obtain the pdics necessary for our mcu products to be compatible with a particular dlc system  we may be unable to satisfy the needs of our customers 
furthermore  future pdic license agreements may contain terms comparable to  or materially different than  the terms of existing agreements  as dictated by competitive or other conditions 
the loss of these pdic license agreements  or our inability to maintain an adequate supply of pdics on acceptable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents if we are unable to satisfy our customers specific product quality  certification or network requirements  our business could be disrupted and our financial condition could be harmed 
our customers demand that our products meet stringent quality  performance and reliability standards 
we have  from time to time  experienced problems in satisfying such standards 
defects or failures have in the past  and may in the future occur relating to our product quality  performance and reliability 
from time to time  our customers also require us to implement specific changes to our products to allow these products to operate within their specific network configurations 
if we are unable to remedy these failures or defects or if we cannot affect such required product modifications  we could experience lost revenues  increased costs  including inventory write offs  warranty expense and costs associated with customer support  delays in or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments and product returns or discounts  any of which would harm our business 
if our accounting controls and procedures are circumvented or otherwise fail to achieve their intended purposes  our business could be seriously harmed 
we evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of each fiscal quarter  and are annually reviewing and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting in order to comply with sec rules relating to internal control over financial reporting adopted pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we ship products that contain defects  the market acceptance of our products and our reputation will be harmed and our customers could seek to recover their damages from us 
our products are complex  and despite extensive testing  may contain defects or undetected errors or failures that may become apparent only after our products have been shipped to our customers and installed in their network or after product features or new versions are released 
any such defect  error or failure could result in failure of market acceptance of our products or damage to our reputation or relations with our customers  resulting in substantial costs for both the company and our customers as well as the cancellation of orders  warranty costs and product returns 
in addition  any defects  errors  misuse of our products or other potential problems within or out of our control that may arise from the use of our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers 
our customers could seek to have us pay for these losses 
although we maintain product liability insurance  it may not be adequate 
we may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations 
failure to comply with environmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business could result in penalties and damage to our reputation 
in effect in the european union are the directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive and the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment the weee directive 
both the rohs directive and the weee directive impact the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported  sold and handled in the european union 
other jurisdictions  such as china  have followed the european union s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal 
although we have concluded that our test and measurement products fall outside the scope of the rohs directive  we have voluntarily undertaken to cause our next generation products to comply with its requirements 
ensuring compliance with the rohs directive  the weee directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions  and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus  could have a negative impact on our business  operations and financial condition 
in addition  based on our conclusion that our test and measurement products do not fall within the scope of these directives  we have determined not to take these compliance measures with respect to certain of our older  legacy products 
should our conclusions with respect to the applicability of the rohs directive to these products be challenged and fail to prevail  we may be subject to monetary and non monetary penalties  and could suffer harm to our reputation 
we are dependent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate our key personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate our key management personnel  including the company s ceo and cfo  and key engineers  necessary to implement our business plan and to grow our business 
despite the adverse economic conditions of the past several years  competition for certain specific technical and management skill sets is intense 
if we are unable to identify and hire the personnel that we need to succeed  or if one or more of our present key employees were to cease to be associated with the company  our future results could be adversely affected 
consolidations in  or a continued slowdown in  the telecommunications industry could harm our business 
we have derived a substantial amount of our revenues from sales of products and related services to the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry has experienced significant growth and consolidation in the past few years  although  over recent years  trends indicate that capital spending by this industry has decreased and may continue to decrease in the future as a result of a general decline in economic growth in local and international markets 
in particular  rboc and large ilec customers have been adversely affected by subscriber line losses as well as by competition from cable and wireless carriers and other carriers entering the local telephone service market 
certain emerging carriers also continue to be hampered by financial instability caused in large part by a lack of access to capital 
in the event of further significant slowdown in capital spending of the telecommunications industry  our business would be adversely affected 
furthermore  as a result of industry consolidation  there may be fewer potential customers requiring our software in the future 
larger  consolidated telecommunications companies may also use their purchasing power to create pressure on the prices and the margins we could realize 
we cannot be certain that consolidations in  or a slowdown in the growth of  the telecommunication industry will not harm our business 

table of contents our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for unexpected revenue shortfalls 
we base our expense levels in part on forecasts of future orders and sales  which are extremely difficult to predict 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel  facilities and sales and marketing 
the level of spending for such expenses cannot be adjusted quickly and is  therefore  relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  our operating results will be harmed if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter 
we rely on software that we have licensed from third party developers to perform key functions in our products 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
we could lose the right to use this software or it could be made available to us only on commercially unreasonable terms 
although we believe that  in most cases  alternative software is available from other third party suppliers or internal developments  the loss of or inability to maintain any of these software licenses or the inability of the third parties to enhance in a timely and cost effective manner their products in response to changing customer needs  industry standards or technological developments could delay or reduce our product shipments until equivalent software could be developed internally or identified  licensed and integrated  which would harm our business 
we are affected by a pattern of product price decline in certain markets  which can harm our business 
because our cable products generate lower margins for us than our proprietary telephony offerings  an increase in the percentage of our sales of cable related products relative to our traditional products will result in lower profit margins 
furthermore  consolidations within the cable industry and the adoption of the docsis standards have caused and could continue to cause pricing pressure as our competitors lower product pricing 
as a result of these factors  our revenues have been and may continue to be adversely affected 
although we have developed docsis based hardware and we believe that our relationships with our oem partners position us to succeed in the marketing of docsis based products  these products will likely generate lower margins than have historically been generated by our proprietary technology 
as a result  as our business shifts from our higher margin proprietary products to lower margin cable offerings and standardized products for which there is greater competition  we will need to sell greater volumes of our products to maintain our profitability 
our common stock price may be extremely volatile 
our common stock price has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
the market price may vary in response to many factors  some of which are outside our control  including general market and economic conditions  changes in the telecommunications industry  actual or anticipated variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new services by us or by our competitors or customers  changes in financial estimates or recommendations or failure to continue research coverage by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  announcements by our customers regarding end market conditions and the status of existing and future infrastructure network deployments  additions or departures of key personnel  and future equity or debt offerings or our announcements of these offerings 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global select market and the securities of technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
these broad market fluctuations have in the past and may in the future materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating results 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against such company 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources that could harm our business 

table of contents we may be subject from time to time to legal proceedings  and any adverse determinations in these proceedings could materially harm our business 
we may from time to time be involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings  which arise in the ordinary course of business 
litigation matters are inherently unpredictable  and we cannot predict the outcome of any such matters 
if we ultimately lose or settle a case  we may be liable for monetary damages and other costs of litigation 
even if we are entirely successful in a lawsuit  we may incur significant legal expenses and our management may expend significant time in the defense 
an adverse resolution of a lawsuit or legal proceeding could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations

overview communication services provide people with a means to communicate through diverse channels ranging from cable television to traditional wired telephone service to wireless telephones to electronic means such as e mail and other internet based offerings 
as a leading producer of network assurance products for wired networks  our mission is to provide industry leading  cost effective service assurance solutions to customers worldwide 
the communications marketplace has evolved rapidly over the last decade  with significant changes in technology  regulation and economic factors affecting our business 
our challenge and opportunity is to leverage our embedded base of customers and strong market position in pots testing to address the testing and monitoring needs of the next generation network architectures 
our strategy is to focus on our core test and measurement competencies to grow and develop our position in new and existing markets by providing innovative products  services  solutions and new technologies to current  adjacent and new markets  realigning our investments to support our core business  improving existing channel partnerships and pursuing new ones  capitalizing on our worldwide customer footprint and relationships  achieving higher levels of execution and performance in all business areas  and enhancing shareholder value through investment  organic growth and potential acquisitions that promote our strategic objectives 
industry and market trends during the late s and into  we benefited greatly from the increased capital spending of our rboc and other customers as they built out or upgraded their digital loop carrier networks during this period 
in early  the telecommunications industry experienced a significant downturn  primarily caused by the general slowdown of the us and global economies during the period  network overcapacity  constrained capital markets and financial difficulties among certain telecommunication providers  especially clecs 
during this period  demand for our legacy products either leveled off or declined in the domestic market 
this downturn persisted into since that time  and continuing through  telecommunications providers began to increase their capital spending as they began to migrate their networks to next generation technologies 
this was a competitive response to other non traditional service providers such as cable and wireless companies seeking to gain market share by adding subscribers once only serviced by traditional fixed wireline carriers 
these events have led to several trends that we expect will continue to impact our business  which are discussed in more detail below incumbent telephone carriers continue to lose customers and revenue to cable providers and smaller  independent local exchange carriers  many of whom are developing their own networks and attempting to compete on price  
table of contents our traditional customer base of incumbent telephone carriers especially the rbocs have considerably slowed their investments in legacy pots line capacity and instead are focusing their capital spending on wireless and next generation wireline projects such as xdsl services  fiber to the premises or fiber to the node collectively  fttx and iptv  due in part to the deregulation of the telecommunications industry that occurred in the late s  both cable and telephone companies as well as the providers of satellite  wireless and other information mediums are embroiled in intense competition over the so called triple play of voice  data and video broadband services  adoption of open  non proprietary standards for status performance monitoring systems  such as hms and docsis  resulting in heightened competition in that market  increased consolidation among rbocs and others in the telecommunications industry  certain telecommunications customers who might traditionally have purchased full service assurance solutions from us are evaluating or have chosen less expensive  integrated testing solutions utilizing chip based technology built into transmission equipment referred to as selt delt as individual components of an overall turn key solution  and as a result of challenges in our traditional markets  we are seeking new opportunities in adjacent markets such as the electric power industry  the utilities are at a critical point with managing their infrastructure  and are looking to next generation network architectures to improve the performance and reliability of the nation s power grid 
customer line loss the most evident market trend to affect our results in the years from through was the general slowdown in the build out of pots networks by incumbent telephone carriers such as the rbocs and other independent local exchange carriers 
beginning in  the declining demand for wired telephone service  known as line loss  caused our customers to lose more wired customer lines than they are adding 
this primarily resulted from competition from wireless telephone and cable voip telephone providers and the reduction in the need for multiple telephone lines due to the increased popularity of dsl which is normally accessed though a household s primary hardwire telephone line and broadband access to the internet 
although we do not believe that wireless or voip service will entirely replace the need for wired telephone service  we do expect that wireless and voip telephones will continue to erode the demand for pots service 
as will be discussed  this has and will continue to reduce demand for some of our legacy pots testing products but also presents opportunities for our new solutions and technologies 
the extent and continued pace of such reduced demand  however  is difficult to predict at this time 
investment in new infrastructure and technologies by our telecommunications customers our telecommunications customers have considerably slowed their investments in pots line capacity relative to their spending patterns in the late s through instead  these providers  from which we derive a large percentage of our revenue  are focusing their capital spending on wireless and next generation wireline projects such as dsl services and fttx projects 
during  telecommunications service providers continued the migration of their networks to these next generation technologies 
a majority of the rbocs have  at present  announced capital budgets for which are at or only slightly below expenditure levels 
rather than investing in pots  however  increasing portions of these capital budgets continue to be allocated to other projects  such as wireless  dsl rollouts  and network improvements  new switching technology and fttx projects 
as a result  we continue to see delays in centralized test system deployments 
at t and qwest have indicated they will continue to use their current hybrid fiber copper networks utilizing dsl technology for the foreseeable future to provide a vast array of competitively priced voice  data and ultimately video services to the market the so called triple play 
verizon is taking a different strategic direction by implementing a deep fiber to the premises fttp network that in some cases will reach directly into the consumers home known as the fios program 
if implemented on a large scale  fttp projects  such as verizon fios  will continue to reduce demand for our mcu and legacy digitest products with those customers 
unlike traditional hybrid networks in which our mcu products are deployed  fiber optic systems can be tested and managed with appropriate software including variations of our loopcare software 
although there is an increased rate of deployment of fttp networks worldwide  it is likely to take many years before there is sufficient penetration to displace the last mile copper network 
as opposed to fttp  others are developing fiber to the node fttn projects  pursuant to which  the fiber link will extend only to the nodes in the network rather than to the customer premises 
this will leave a portion of the copper network intact 
given 
table of contents the size and breadth of the present hybrid networks  including the billions of dollars invested in them  coupled with the billions of dollars required to replace them with all fiber optic lines  we believe that the copper portion of the network will remain an important part of the telecommunications system in the united states for the foreseeable future 
as long as that copper portion remains  some need for traditional testing methods should continue 
as a result of these trends  we continue to expect that sales of our legacy mcu products will continue to decline on an annual basis 
these declines are likely to accelerate as the rbocs complete their respective fttx expansion programs 
the company s strategy to respond to these trends is outlined in the section of this md a entitled our reponses to these industry trends that follows 
a review of the impact of these network trends on certain of the company s intangible assets is contained in the critical accounting policies section of this item intense competition among telecommunications and cable service providers the continuing evolution of the communications marketplace has resulted  and will continue to result  in intense competition among telecommunications and cable service providers 
the deregulation of the industry over the past eight years has allowed cable service providers as well as new competitors such as wireless service providers and voip service providers to enter the market to offer consumers increasing choice among a variety of communication services  including voice  data  and video services 
wireless service providers offer the consumer the ability to place calls from nearly any location in the united states  and from most parts of the world 
voip service providers allow a person to place phone calls from a voip phone either to other voip customers or to hardwired or wireless telephone numbers 
as a result  competition among telecommunications providers has greatly increased and the industry has transformed from a highly regulated monopolistic model to a free market model 
these factors have adversely affected our business to varying degrees over the past three years 
our products have historically been sold primarily to telephone and cable television companies 
because there are still a relatively limited number of such companies  the loss of any of our traditional customers may translate into reduced demand for our offerings  especially our test system and test access hardware products 
conversely  increased competition into the marketplace has further driven our traditional customers to invest in their access networks leading to new test system opportunities 
telephone companies  especially the rbocs  have also been attempting to meet the demand for broadband services  with the build out of their dsl networks  which in some instances has resulted in increased demand for our mcu products 
however  as discussed above  the expansion of the broadband market will likely continue to reduce the demand for pots service  potentially depressing overall sales of copper based testing products including mcu products 
increased competition in cable markets resulting from standardization through the adoption of open  non proprietary standards for status performance monitoring systems  such as hms and docsis  the market for our cable products has become highly competitive 
we have experienced significant pricing pressures as all providers of monitoring transponders and associated software have reduced price points to meet customer demands 
during  alpha introduced a docsis based transponder which competes with the products we supply to the market both directly and through our supply agreement with alpha 
unlike most of the existing telephone networks  the hfc networks maintained by the cable television companies are capable of providing broadband services with little additional capital investments 
in general  cable companies have been quite successful with their deployments of high bandwidth internet services 
the adoption of the docsis standard for cable modems by several cable companies has eliminated the demand for certain of our proprietary cheetah head end hardware products  and has reduced demand for other associated proprietary cheetah offerings 
in the cable marketplace  cable providers continue to drive the adoption of broadband and expand services beyond just traditional cable television service to high speed data and voice services 
they are also aggressively attacking competitors with offerings targeted at business customers 
consolidation in telecommunications market competition in the telecommunications market has had the secondary effect of resulting in the consolidation of many of the telecommunications service providers 
just a few years ago  there were six rbocs 
that number has now been reduced to three 
in some ways  we have benefited from the increased competition in the industry  because such competition has brought more and new providers into the market that may need our products to provide consistent and quality telecommunications services 
however  to the extent competition drives further industry consolidations  we have experienced and could continue to experience disruption of our 
table of contents existing customer relationships  delays or loss of customer orders and pricing pressures caused by the reduction in the number of customers desiring our products 
these trends cause decreased revenues and lower net income 
as stated above  however  we believe that it is too early to predict the course that industry consolidations will take in the future  or how such consolidations might affect our future revenues 
further  our major customers are currently actively pursuing acquisitions to add to their product offerings  such as the rbocs acquiring wireless capabilities 
we do not currently sell products to wireless carriers  accordingly  these acquisitions will likely cause our customers to decrease spending in traditional areas as they divert funding to these acquisitions and integrations 
alternative embedded testing methods we have begun to face increased competition from certain network equipment providers that offer testing technology in the form of a chipset embedded into their products 
where testing was once only available in the form of multi chip  circuit board based designs like those found in our remote test system products  integrated testing technology is now available in low cost chipsets embedded into the products of these network equipment providers 
known as selt delt  the testing technology available in this form has limited functionality and only provides partial views of faults in the network 
as such  we continue to believe that more robust testing technology like that offered in our products should be important for network assurance as the next generation network evolves and increased penetration of triple play services occurs 
however  we have and will continue to face competition and downward pricing pressure from the availability of these less expensive  less robust alternatives resulting in decreased sales of our system products to certain of our customers  particularly in the clec market 
due in part to their adoption of the selt delt technology  revenues from these customers have decreased dramatically 
electric power utility market with the development and limited introduction of our new lighthouse product line  we are targeting our service assurance products into a new market  the electric utility industry 
this industry is in a tremendous period of change 
there has been minimal to no improvement in the delivery efficiency in decades and minimal infrastructure investment in years 
there are estimates that greater than half of today s utility infrastructure will need to be replaced in the next ten years 
simultaneously  we believe that regulatory changes for improved reliability cannot be met without new hardware and software  and that the reporting requirements alone will require new capabilities 
moreover  climate change issues are driving investment in renewable energy sources and demand response capabilities that add significant complexity to the distribution grid 
as a result of these factors  many of the major electric utilities are looking to next generation network architectures and new technology to improve the performance and reliability of the nation s power grid 
we believe that smart grid sensors and software to remotely monitor expensive equipment can enable electric utilities to meet demands for improved grid reliability  faster response to disturbances  increased energy efficiency and better  more cost effective management of assets 
we are developing a sensor technology that will provide utilities with a snapshot of the grid s current status for fault and equipment problem location and historical data to enable better economic decisions about asset operations and maintenance  plus more accurate load research and forecasting 
our responses to these industry trends the evolution of the telecommunication and cable networks requires us to constantly evaluate our core business strategy and product offerings 
we have taken a number of steps to position the company to take advantage of our strengths  as follows development and marketing of solutions given the increasing interest of the rbocs in fttx projects and the importance of software products to cable monitoring systems  we have increased our emphasis on developing and marketing new product solutions for network assurance 
we continue to engage in research and development of new and expanded telecommunications and cable products and to aggressively market and sell our products both domestically and internationally 
telecommunications solutions our loopcare and tel celerity solutions are already the primary oss software for copper line networks 
because fiber only networks require new and unique software and hardware solutions for network testing  we have actively promoted our ability to adapt our existing oss systems to serve fttn systems 
in addition  we are actively engaged in research and development of new hardware solutions for hybrid fiber networks 
since its introduction  our digitest test head has undergone several significant developmental changes 
with the loopcare software in combination with the digitest hardware  we offer a complete integrated testing system to smaller customers such as clecs and international customers 
furthermore  as a result of past extensive research and development efforts  we offer our digitest edge product  which combines the reliability of our digitest pots testing system with our new broadband services unit 
table of contents bsu test capability and t special services test capability  under certain applications 
our digitest hub product was designed to support multiple testing environments  including broadband testing  while retaining interfaces to legacy equipment 
the digitest ice was designed to provide both metallic and multi layered dsl testing to help service providers install and maintain broadband triple play services within traditional and hybrid fiber copper networks 
although these products have seen some success in certain international customers  and have been approved in certain domestic networks  we have not had success selling them into the domestic service providers 
furthermore  it is not clear whether the international customers who have deployed these products will continue to do so  as the original projects driving these product sales are substantially complete 
however  we continue to actively market and attempt to sell these products into both domestic and international markets 
as the dsl subscriber base of the rbocs network reaches a level of maturity that should support higher measures of centralized testing  certain portions of the digitest product family  including digitest ice  should compete favorably with similar offerings in that market 
we also continue to aggressively sell our existing legacy telecommunications products 
for example  we are actively marketing the system as a replacement for  or upgrade to  the existing lts employed by the rbocs to target problems in their pots network 
we believe that digitest is a good replacement product for the existing ltss  which are decades old 
replacement parts for them are no longer produced 
despite our marketing efforts  however  except for small scale deployments in certain selected markets  the rbocs have yet to allocated significant capital resources to lts replacement projects  and we expect that in the current competitive environment  they will continue to attempt to utilize the existing lts equipment as long as possible 
we also continue to actively market digitest to clec customers  whose strategy requires them to deploy and manage their own telecommunications infrastructure  including the deployment of a new centralized test system 
the overall goal of our strategic emphasis on new product development and positioning of certain legacy telecommunications products is to allow us to replace the revenue historically generated by our legacy mcu products 
as the life cycle for mcu products continues to mature  and certain rbocs and other customers focus their capital spending on network improvements such as fttx rather than hybrid networks  demand for our mcu and existing digitest products will likely diminish 
nevertheless  for the reasons discussed above  we expect that mcu sales will continue to contribute to our revenues for the foreseeable future 
the continuing general trends of reduced mcu sales as well as expansion of our product lines  have resulted in the broadening of our customer base 
this trend reflects the diversion by rboc customers of their spending away from the traditional pots network testing elements and more toward next generation network build outs and our efforts to replace these lost revenues with sales to new customers  including cable companies  and increasing international sales 
as a result  we expect that our sales to the rbocs as a percentage of our total revenue will continue to decrease in and beyond 
as fiber pushes closer to the home in the telecommunications network  the transmission equipment located at remote sites carry lower levels of line density 
as a result  the acceptable business case for test system alternatives requires significantly lower levels of capital investment by the service provider  which translates into requirements for lower platform costs for software and hardware test solutions 
this has caused these carriers to look to alternative  less expensive ways to test their networks  such as selt delt 
we have reacted to this trend by identifying opportunities where we might partner with chipset vendors  such as zarlink  to expand the interface capabilities of our loopcare and tel systems to these embedded test functions in order to leverage our customers existing legacy investment 
in addition  we are actively pursuing lower cost test hardware platforms  which we believe will maintain significant advantages over alternatives 
cable solutions since  we have offered our legacy cable hardware and software products to cable companies for status monitoring of their networks 
in order to grow our cable status monitoring product line  on february   we purchased the cheetah product line from jds uniphase 
with the addition of the cheetah product line  we have become a supplier of status monitoring hardware and software to nearly every major cable company 
most of these large cable msos are in the process of or have adopted the docsis standards into their broadband network 
we have taken a proactive approach to this through development of docsis based monitoring hardware 
we have entered into distribution arguments with third parties  including alpha  to become a supplier of this technology to the hfc networks 
by aligning with alpha  and as result of their competitive positioning as the predominant provider of power supplies to the cable industry  we significantly broadened our scope of opportunities for our docsis products 
our non exclusive distribution agreement with alpha continues to be a very important part of our docsis product distribution strategy 
however  we also now face competition from alpha  as they introduced a competitive docsis based transponder in  which has adversely impacted our sales of this product 
because our cable products generate lower margins than our proprietary mcu and software offerings  an increase in the percentage of our sales of cable related products relative to our traditional products has and will continue to result in lower 
table of contents profitability 
furthermore  consolidations within the cable industry and the adoption of the docsis standards have caused and will continue to cause pricing and margin pressure as competitors continue to reduce pricing 
as a result  our revenues and net income have been and may continue to be adversely affected 
we are working on strategies to offset these lower margins by lowering manufacturing costs while offering additional feature sets to our docsis based products  such as our downloadable software modules for voip and ip testing  that are intended to build upon an embedded base of core technology 
even with the adoption of docsis by many cable providers  we believe that there still is market opportunity for our proprietary cheetah status monitoring systems  especially for those customers who have already made significant investments in our cable products 
nevertheless  the further evolution of cable industry standards has diminished and likely will continue to diminish the need for some of these proprietary products 
over the past couple of years  we have designed and marketed our cheetahxd broadband assurance platform  which was designed to monitor the physical network elements that provide high speed data and voip services 
we have also developed downloadable software modules for voip and ip testing through the docsis based transponder 
the adoption of docsis technology has stimulated some sales of our cheetahxd software and associated docsis based transponders  however  to date sales of these products has not had the penetration we had expected 
also  any increased margins enjoyed from the sale of cheetahxd software has not offset the rapid margin decline experienced as a result of the sales shift from proprietary to predominantly docsis hardware 
we have reacted to this situation by further reducing our costs for this product line through a restructuring and re alignment implemented in further discussion pertaining to this restructuring follows  under the heading realignment of resources 
we are also working to increase cooperation with alpha  our primary oem sales channel in the cable market  in an attempt to maximize revenues from this source 
during  we also introduced what we believed to be the industry s first embedded docsis based node transponder platform  designed to enable cable operators to proactively monitor and control their fiber nodes 
this provides a cost benefit for operators as it eliminates the need for headend equipment 
we currently have agreements or active discussions with a number of node manufacturers to develop docsis based node transponders for various nodes in the marketplace 
expansion into other industries with similar products as part of our strategy to introduce new test and monitoring solutions into new markets  during we expanded into the electric power utility market with the limited introduction of our lighthouse centralized remote monitoring system 
this product is currently in beta trials and is expected to be generally available later in this product development effort was also intended to diversify our business 
much of the underlying lighthouse system components are similar to those in our telecommunications and cable solutions  which should lower our market entry costs while increasing the probability of successful product development  stability and features 
a lighthouse sensor  mounted directly on the electrical conductor  is being developed to continuously monitor key circuit parameters and transmit data over a wireless network to a central location  reducing time of detecting a problem on the grid  identifying its location and restoring service 
the new product line is a system of components that will include a wireless sensor  an aggregator device that collects data  and software to enable viewing  maintenance and reporting functions in real time 
the ultimate goal of the system is to improve the overall efficiency of energy delivery  improve customer satisfaction and improve the financial performance of the electric utilities 
the electric utility market is experiencing growth which may be able to offset declines in some of the legacy technology areas within our business 
we believe we have identified a market need that could be met by bringing intelligence to the power grid to provide real time detection of faults and to help minimize the impact of outages while optimizing the utilization of assets 
acquisitions and our expanding geographic footprint over the past several years  we have diversified our product offerings and markets through our acquisitions 
we continue to explore alternatives to enhance and expand upon our test and measurement global footprint and to evaluate all pertinent acquisition and partnership opportunities that could strengthen our position in our core or adjacent markets 
on august   we acquired btd from teradyne  inc this acquisition significantly enhanced our global reach in our core test and measurement market  which in combination with our emerson acquisition in  gave us immediate and significant presence in europe  with the addition of significant large customers such as british telecom  deutsche telecom  kpn and others 
we have had less success with the sale of the products from the emerson acquisition  following completion of a large eastern european project  but we continue to actively market these products into international accounts 
the revenue footprint of btd was largely international  such that our revenue from international customers was  and of our total revenue in  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   sales to customers in the americas excluding the united states were approximately million or of international sales  sales to customers in emea were million or of international sales  and sales to customers in asia pacific were million or of international sales 

table of contents furthermore  the company enjoys a stream of software maintenance revenue from international sources  which was strengthened as a result of our btd acquisition 
our cheetah product lines are also marketed internationally through oem relationships 
as demand for cable service internationally increases  our cable products in particular may offer an avenue to further international sales  as worldwide cable standards do not differ materially from those supported by our products 
in the short term  the success of our loopcare  tel celerity  digitest and cheetah offerings will primarily be dependent on the efforts of our oem partners and in the competitiveness of our oem pricing model 
realignment of resources in the first quarter of  the company initiated certain strategic initiatives designed to better align the company s resources around growth opportunities in current  adjacent and new markets 
these actions were taken in response to the trends in our industry including greater competition  continuing consolidation amongst our customer base  and shifts of service provider spending away from systems that telecommunications and msos consider legacy in nature 
as a result of these initiatives  we expect to achieve annual cost savings of approximately million 
in addition the company is diverting approximately million of spending in to the new lighthouse product initiative as described above 
there is no guarantee that the savings discussed above  coupled with potential economic benefits from any of the company s new product initiatives  will be appropriately timed and or generate sufficient revenue to offset the unfavorable effects on our business of the trends discussed above 
should the company find that the measures taken to date are not sufficient  other strategic initiatives may be implemented 
other company trends in addition to the industry and product trends that we have already discussed  our operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from time to time as a result of various other factors  including the timing of orders from  shipments to  and acceptance of software by  the rboc customers and significant international and independent telephone companies 
this timing is particularly sensitive to various business factors unique to each of our larger customers  including their relationships with various organized labor groups and a continuing tendency to place large orders for shipment of hardware and software toward the end of a quarter  which may result in orders placed in one quarter not being filled until the next period 
furthermore  our product sales have become more project oriented in the last few years  with large portions of revenue from those projects being conditioned on acceptance of large orders or phases  which might move from quarter to quarter 
in addition  the markets for some of our products  such as our systems test products and cable products are highly competitive 
due to the rapidly evolving market in which these products compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources could further intensify the competition for these products 
we believe that the changes outlined above and others within the telecommunications marketplace  industry consolidation  as well as our continuing efforts to expand our customer base and product offerings  have required us to grant more favorable terms to some of our customers  which has and expected to continue to result in pressure to our gross margins 
although we will continue to strive to meet the demands of our customers  which include delivery of quality products at an acceptable price on acceptable terms  we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating acceptable terms and conditions with our customers or that these continuing efforts by our rboc customers to consolidate their inventory and product procurement systems will not cause fluctuations or delays in our order patterns or order cancellations 
our results reflected revenues from services of approximately  compared to approximately and in and  respectively 
the increase in revenues from services in is attributed to revenues related to our btd acquisition on august   which had largely a service oriented revenue base 
further  we expect that including btd revenues for the entire year in our consolidated revenues should cause the percentage of services revenue to total revenue to increase even further in the future 
therefore  since our services revenue is typically associated with existing purchase orders  contracts or a combination of both  we expect predictability of revenues from this portion of the business to improve 
during  the remainder of our revenue  or of the consolidated total  was comprised of sales of software and hardware products to new or existing customers 
a significant portion of this revenue was recognized under orders or contracts for project related business  which largely concluded at the end of at the present time  there is no significant continuation of those projects reflected in the company s backlog that would replace those revenue streams and we have not entered into agreements for any such new projects that could contribute to revenue in this is resulting in a general decline in expected revenues from our core test system products  for all the reasons discussed above 
management presently expects that this revenue decline can be offset to some extent by the addition of services revenue from the btd acquisition for the full year of  but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in offsetting this entire decline  or that the decline might not accelerate more quickly than expected 
however  in any event  our revenue stream from non project related sources is very likely to become even more difficult to predict during  and could possibly result in swings or declines in business levels from quarter to quarter  and such swings or declines may be material 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the application of certain of these accounting principles is more critical than others in gaining an understanding of the basis upon which our financial statements have been prepared 
we consider the following accounting policies to involve critical accounting estimates revenue recognition we market and sell test system hardware and related software to the telecommunications and cable television industries 
the company follows staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition  for hardware and software sales 
this bulletin requires  among other things  that revenue should be recognized only when title has transferred and risk of loss has passed to a customer with the capability to pay  and that there are no significant remaining obligations of the company related to the sale 
the bulk of our hardware sales are made to rbocs and other large customers 
delivery terms of hardware sales are predominantly fob origin 
revenue is recognized for these customers upon shipment against a valid purchase order 
where title and risk of loss do not pass to the customer until the product reaches the customer s delivery site  revenue is deferred unless the company can objectively determine delivery occurred before the end of the applicable reporting period 
we reduce collection risk by requiring letters of credit or other payment guarantees for significant sales to new customers and or those in weak financial condition 
for software license fees and maintenance revenue  we follow the aicpa s statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
this statement requires that software license fee revenue be recorded only when evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the software has been delivered  and a customer with the capacity to pay has accepted the software  leaving no significant obligations on the part of the company to perform 
we require a customer purchase order or other written agreement to document the terms of a software order and written acceptance from the customer prior to revenue recognition 
in certain limited cases  however  agreements provide for automatic customer acceptance after the passage of time from a pre determined event and we have relied on these provisions for an indication of the timing of revenue recognition 
in isolated cases for orders of custom software  or orders that require significant software customization  such as that associated with our contract for test gear deployment in saudi arabia  we employ contract accounting using the percentage of completion method  whereby revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the revenue for orders with multiple deliverables such as hardware  software and or installation or other services may be separated into stand alone fair values if not already documented in the purchase order or agreement and where list prices or other objective evidence of fair value exists to support such allocation  in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue will not be recognized for any single element until all elements considered essential to the functionality of the delivered elements under the contract are delivered and accepted 
the recognition of revenue under eitf requires certain judgment by management 
if any undelivered elements  which can include hardware  software or services  are essential to the functionality of the system as defined in the contract  revenue will not be recorded until all of the items considered essential are delivered as one unit of accounting 
our internal policy requires that we obtain a written acceptance from our customers for each specific customer situation where new products are sold 
revenue will not be recorded until written acceptance is received from the customer 
although infrequent  in some situations contingencies will be noted by the customer on the written acceptance 
in these situations  management will use judgment to determine the importance of such contingencies for recognizing revenue related to the sale 
the company s general practice is to defer revenue recognition unless these contingencies are inconsequential 
our loopcare and other software customers usually enter into separate agreements for software maintenance upon expiration of the stated software warranty period 
maintenance agreements include software upgrades and bug fixes as they become available  however  newly developed features must be purchased separately 
post warranty maintenance for new features is either included under the current maintenance agreement without additional charge  and is considered in the maintenance agreement fees  or is separately charged upon expiration of the warranty 
depending upon the timing of the enhancement purchase and the length of the maintenance agreement  we must evaluate whether or not a portion of a perpetual right to use fee should be treated as post contract support to be deferred and recognized over the remaining life of the maintenance agreement 
software maintenance revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the period the respective arrangements are in effect 
revenue recognition  especially for software products  involves critical judgments and decisions that can result in material effects to reported net income 
intangible assets and goodwill at december   we had net intangible assets of million primarily resulting from the acquisitions of the loopcare product line in september  the cheetah product line in february  the test business of emerson in february 
table of contents and the btd acquisition in august  in connection with these acquisitions  we utilized the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which were issued in july sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and that goodwill  as well as any indefinite lived intangible assets  not be amortized for financial reporting purposes 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis or an accelerated method  whichever better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the asset are consumed or otherwise used 
software related intangible assets are amortized based on the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life 
in connection with the assets acquired in the loopcare transaction  intangible assets of million were identified with residual goodwill of million 
these included developed product software valued at million and loopcare base software valued at million 
both have been determined to have finite useful lives of five years and ten years  respectively  and are being amortized over those periods 
also identified were intangible assets related to the loopcare trade name of million and post warranty service agreements of million 
because of the longevity of the loopcare trade name and the stability  level of embedment  and unique dependence of the rbocs on the post warranty maintenance services  these intangible assets were determined to have indefinite useful lives at the acquisition date 
with regard to the post warranty maintenance service agreements  during the fourth quarter of  management determined that events and circumstances which supported the indefinite life of this asset had changed 
more specifically one of the company s key customers continues to implement a fttp initiative which indicates that the intangible asset related to the post warranty service agreements may not have an indefinite useful life 
this development as well as circumstances surrounding recent post warranty contract renewals led the company to conclude that in accordance with sfas no 
 a finite useful life should be assigned and the intangible asset should be amortized beginning october  management currently believes that the hybrid fiber copper network currently deployed by the rbocs  which is tested by the underlying loopcare base software  will exist for at least an additional fifty years 
management has therefore assigned a useful life to this asset of fifty years 
in connection with the assets acquired in the cheetah transaction  intangible assets of million were identified with residual goodwill of million 
the intangible assets consisted of the cheetah base software valued at million  the cheetah customer base valued at million  proprietary technology valued at million and cheetah maintenance agreements valued at million 
the cheetah base software  proprietary technology and cheetah maintenance agreements were determined to have useful lives of ten years  while the cheetah customer base whose value is based on discounted cash flows generated on hardware sales which typically continue five years beyond the sale of the corresponding base software  was assigned a useful life of fifteen years 
a cheetah trademark asset valued at million was identified and determined to have an indefinite useful life 
on february   tollgrade acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the test systems business unit of emerson for million in cash 
the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchase price allocation was finalized in the first quarter of based on our final purchase price allocation  we have identified million of customer relationship intangible assets and million in technology related intangible assets both having an estimated life of five years 
we also identified million associated with a tradename that is expected to have a useful life of three years 
finally  we allocated million of the purchase price to the sales order backlog that was acquired  which was consumed during goodwill was approximately million 
on august   tollgrade acquired certain assets associated with btd from teradyne  inc for a purchase price of approximately million in cash  the assumption of certain liabilities and payment of acquisition costs of million for a total acquisition expenditure of million 
the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of based on purchase price allocation  we have identified million of customer relationship intangible assets and million in technology related intangible assets 
we have also identified million associated with customer maintenance contracts and million to other intangible assets acquired 
based on the purchase price allocation  we recorded goodwill of approximately million 
sensitivity analysis certain portions of the telecommunications market serviced by the company s products are evolving and  when appropriate  management reviews the impact of such changes on the key assumptions underlying the valuation of each of its intangible assets 
technological advances  as well as potential changes in strategic direction by any of the company s key telecommunications or cable customers  could result in an impairment or substantial reduction in one or more of the estimated lives over which the respective intangible asset s is are currently being amortized 
the following table lists intangible assets with a remaining life at december  of at least one year 
table of contents years remaining original life at carrying value projected asset description life at amortization in millions loopcare base software post warranty maintenance service agreements cheetah base software proprietary technology customer base emerson proprietary technology customer relationship btd post warranty maintenance service agreements post warranty maintenance service agreements post warranty maintenance service agreements post warranty maintenance service agreements technology customer relationship other in the event that the company would reevaluate the above estimated useful lives in the future due to changed events and circumstances  annual amortization would increase based on the respective intangible asset s carrying value and revised remaining useful life 
reviews for impairment goodwill and certain other intangible assets  determined to have an indefinite life  are not amortized 
instead  these assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
during these reviews for impairment of indefinite lived assets  other than goodwill  we review any changes in facts and circumstances which would impact the estimated useful life of the asset 
we perform our annual impairment tests on december st of each year 
with respect to goodwill  we have determined that we have one reporting unit 
at december  and  we based our goodwill impairment test on a comparison of the fair value  which we estimated based on our market capitalization and an estimated control premium to the company s book value 
due to a decline in the trading price of the company s shares during the fourth quarter of  in addition to a revision in revenue projections  we prepared a valuation of the company s enterprise value to determine the implicit value of goodwill at december  consequently  we determined that our goodwill was entirely impaired  and in connection therewith recorded a non cash charge in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill are valued using the relief from royalty method with no residual value 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  our annual impairment tests indicated partial impairment of both loopcare and cheetah trade names 
as a result  the company recorded a million non cash charge to reflect this impairment and  in addition  assigned a definite life of five and ten years to the loopcare and cheetah trade names  respectively  based on current events and circumstances 
we review our finite lived intangible assets or fixed assets and their related useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable  including a change in the competitive landscape  any internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies  a loss of a significant customer  or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products 
an impairment results if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and disposition of the asset or the period of economic benefit has changed 
if impairment were indicated  the amount of the impairment would be determined by comparing the carrying value of the asset group to the fair value of the asset group 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
the projection of the future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate require significant management judgment 
the key assumptions that management must estimate include sales volume  prices  inflation  product costs  capital expenditures and sales and 
table of contents marketing costs 
for developed technology  we also must estimate the likelihood of both pursuing a particular strategy and the level of expected market adoption 
this test of intangible assets relative to impairments involves critical accounting estimates 
we relied upon our financial plan for and best estimates of revenues and cash flows for later years in measuring current values  however  these expectations may not be realized and future events and market conditions might indicate material impairment of value that could result in material charges to net income 
such a future situation would not  however  in and of itself affect our cash flow or liquidity 
inventory valuation we utilize a standard cost system that approximates first in  first out costing of the products 
standards are monitored monthly and changes are made on individual parts  if warranted  otherwise standard costs are updated on all parts annually  normally in november of each year 
the cost of excess capacity is not included in the standard cost of inventory  but is charged to cost of sales as a period cost 
we evaluate our inventories on a monthly basis for slow moving  excess and obsolete stock on hand 
the carrying value of such inventory that is determined not to be realizable is reduced  in whole or in part  by a charge to cost of sales and reduction of the inventory value in the financial statements 
the evaluation process  which has been consistently followed  relies in large part on a review of inventory items that have not been sold  purchased or used in production within a one year period 
management also reviews  where appropriate  inventory products that do not meet this threshold but which may be unrealizable due to discontinuance of products  evolving technologies  loss of certain customers or other known factors 
as a result of this comprehensive review process  an adjustment to the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory is normally made monthly 
inventory identified as obsolete is also discarded from time to time when circumstances warrant 
inventory realization is considered a critical accounting estimate since it relies in large part on management judgments as to future events and differing judgments could materially affect reported net income 
on july   tollgrade announced a restructuring program which included the discontinuance of various products that are not part of the company s strategic focus 
as a result of this review  we recorded an inventory write down of million for the year end december  income taxes we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  in reporting the effects of income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
as of december   we had net deferred tax liabilities of million 
as of december   we had net deferred tax liabilities recorded of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company records a valuation allowance to reduce tax assets by jurisdiction to an amount for which realization is more likely than not 
in and  based on our evaluation of the company s ability to utilize its tax assets including any net operating loss carryforwards  from a us federal income tax point of view  it was determined that net of available carrybacks the company could generate sufficient taxable income in future years making it more likely than not that such tax assets could be realized 
those same evaluations done on a state by state jurisdictional basis in and did not support a similar conclusion  and valuation allowances in the amount of million and million in and  respectively  were recorded to establish or maintain a reserve against all state nol s except certain states where unitary filings are permitted 
in  the company once again evaluated its tax asset and net operating loss carryforward positions at december   from a realizability point of view in accordance with sfas no 
upon completing the evaluation  the company recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of its us federal and state deferred tax assets  except to the extent of deferred tax liabilities  as it is presently unable to determine that it is more likely than not that those net deferred tax assets will be realized 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million in the company s accompanying consolidated income statement for the year ended december  in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized on an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin details how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose uncertain tax positions that have been or expect to be taken 
as such  financial statements will reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
effective january   the company adopted fin there was no cumulative effect as a result of the adoption of fin warranty we provide warranty coverage on our various products 
terms of coverage range from up to one year on software to two to five years for hardware products 
we review products returned for repair under warranty on a quarterly basis and adjust the accrual for future warranty costs based upon cumulative returns experience 
we also evaluate special warranty problems for products with high return rates to correct the underlying causes and  where deemed necessary  to provide additional warranty expense for expected higher returns of these products 
warranty costs associated with software sales are also accrued based on the projected hours to be incurred during the warranty period normally three months 
the accounting for warranty costs involves critical estimates and judgments that can have a material effect on net income 

table of contents assets held for sale we classify long lived assets as held for sale when certain criteria are met  including management s commitment to a plan to sell the assets  the availability of the assets for immediate sale in their present condition  whether an active program to locate buyers and other actions to sell the assets has been initiated  whether the sale of the assets is probable and their transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year  whether the assets are being marketed at reasonable prices in relation to their fair value  and how unlikely it is that significant changes will be made to the plan to sell the assets 
assets held for sale are classified as other current asset in the condensed consolidate balance sheet 
we measure assets to be disposed of by sale at the lower of carrying amounts or fair value less cost to sell 
fair value for the assets currently held for sale is determined based on management s estimates of market value  supported by independent real estate broker opinion 
restructuring accrual in july  we began to implement a formalized restructuring program based on our business strategies and economic outlook to increase efficiency and reduce costs 
in connection with these strategic initiatives  we recorded estimated expenses associated with employee severance  relocation and lease termination costs 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  generally costs associated with restructuring activities initiated after december  have been recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
however  in the case of leases  the expense is estimated and accrued when the property is vacated 
given the significance and the timing of execution of such activities  the is process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the cost of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
pension benefits in connection with our btd acquisition  we assumed and now sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for three employees based in germany 
accounting for the cost of this plan requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in this plan 
this estimation requires judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  rate of future compensation increases  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuations of the pension benefit liability  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on an investment grade bond yield curve with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate base on changes in investment grade bond yields 
future compensations rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined base on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock option and restricted stock awards over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish fair value of all awards 
the black scholes valuation method requires that we make certain estimates regarding estimated forfeiture rates  expected holding period and stock price volatility 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of our international operations are translated into us united states dollars using year end exchange rates  while revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates throughout the year 
the resulting net translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the local currency is the functional currency for all of our locations 
these areas involving critical accounting estimates are periodically reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of our board of directors
