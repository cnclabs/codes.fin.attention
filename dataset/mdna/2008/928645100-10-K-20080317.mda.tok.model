item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we design  develop  manufacture and commercialize a broad suite of intravascular ultrasound  or ivus  and functional measurement  or fm  products that we believe enhance the diagnosis and treatment of vascular and structural heart disease 
our products seek to deliver all of the benefits associated with conventional ivus and fm devices  while providing enhanced functionality and proprietary features that address the limitations associated with conventional forms of these technologies 
as a result  we believe that our ivus and fm products have the potential to become the standard of care to address the needs of patients  hospitals  physicians and third party payors on a cost effective basis 
we have focused on building our us and international sales and marketing infrastructure to market our products to physicians and technicians who perform percutaneous interventional procedures in hospitals and to other personnel who make purchasing decisions on behalf of hospitals 
we expanded our worldwide sales organization from employees in july to employees as of december   which included direct sales representatives in the united states  western europe and asia 
we sell our products directly to customers in certain european markets and utilize distributors in other european markets  including spain  portugal and parts of italy 
as of december   our distribution efforts in europe were led by a general manager  a director of european sales  account representatives and seven clinical specialists 
three companies distribute our ivus and fm products in japan 
we have direct contractual relationships with goodman  fukuda denshi and johnson johnson cordis division 
in addition  fukuda denshi has sub distribution agreements with other parties 
while these multi level relationships allow us to access specific customers and markets  they create complex distribution arrangements and increase our reliance on our japanese distributors 
in emerging markets  including the major markets of asia pacific  latin america  europe  australia  africa and the middle east  we have distributor relationships through which we sell our products 
our distributors are involved in product launch planning  education and training  physician support and clinical trial management 
fukuda denshi  one of our distributors in japan  accounted for of our revenues in  in and in in the first quarter of  goodman  formerly boston scientific s distributor of its ivus products in japan  began to distribute our ivus products in japan through a sub distribution agreement with fukuda denshi 
due to this new distribution relationship  we experienced a significant increase in orders for our ivus consoles and catheters from fukuda denshi during as goodman purchased initial inventory of our products to market to its over  interventional cardiology accounts 
as a result of the significant order activity by goodman  our revenues  including our mix of consoles and single procedure disposable catheters  and the costs of those revenues in  may not be comparable to other periods 
additionally  fukuda denshi transferred the japanese regulatory approvals  or shonins  for our phased array ivus products to us on june  due to the transfer  we are now able to sell directly to distributors in japan as opposed to being required to sell our phased array ivus products only to fukuda denshi 
as a result  for a portion of  we sold directly to goodman and fukuda denshi and the percentage of our revenues attributable to fukuda denshi declined  while the percentage of revenues attributed to goodman increased  accounting for  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and in  of our revenues and of our operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  we are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operating results in the future 
our ivus products are comprised of consoles  single procedure disposable catheters and advanced functionality options 
our family of consoles includes the ivus in vision gold  or ivg  and the new pc based s the s family of products was launched on a limited basis early in and became our primary console offering following its full commercial launch in mid we are developing advanced functionality options including real time vh ivus  ivus and angiographic image co registration  and phased array and rotational catheter compatibility 
our single procedure disposable ivus catheters only operate and interface with our family of ivus consoles 

table of contents our fm products consist of pressure and flow consoles and single procedure disposable pressure and flow guide wires 
our fm consoles are mobile  proprietary and high speed electronic systems with different functionalities and sizes designed and manufactured to process and display the signals received from our guide wires 
we are developing customized cath lab versions of our consoles and advanced functionality options as part of our vfusion cath lab integration initiative 
the significantly expanded functionality of our vfusion offering will allow for networking of patient information  control of ivus and fm information at both the operating table and in the cath lab control room  as well as the capability for images to be displayed on standard cath lab monitors 
we expect to continue to develop new products and technologies to expand our vfusion offering 
as of december   we had a worldwide installed base of over  ivus consoles and over fm consoles 
we intend to grow and leverage this installed base to drive recurring sales of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires 
in  the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our revenues  a million  or increase from  in which the sale of our single procedure disposable catheters and guide wires accounted for million  or of our revenues 
we manufacture our ivus and fm consoles  ivus catheters and fm guide wires at our facility in rancho cordova  california 
we use third party manufacturing partners to produce circuit boards and mechanical sub assemblies used in the manufacture of our consoles 
we also use third party manufacturing partners for certain proprietary components used in the manufacture of our single procedure disposable products 
we perform incoming inspection on these circuit boards  mechanical sub assemblies and components  assemble them into finished products  and test the final product to assure quality control 
our former supplier of fm wire pressure sensors ceased production of this key component on wafers 
we secured an end of life purchase in of the subject parts equivalent to an estimated four year supply 
we believe this will provide us with adequate time to initiate and qualify a replacement supplier or a new design to replace the product 
we expect that it will take approximately months to identify an appropriate replacement supplier  complete design work and undertake the necessary inspections before the new pressure sensors will be available 
from our inception in january until july  we were engaged principally in the research and development of tools designed to diagnose vulnerable plaque 
in july  we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the ivus and fm product lines of jomed  inc  or the jomed acquisition 
we also acquired certain ivus patents and technology from philips in july these purchases were significant in executing our strategy to leverage our ivus technology and build our business 
our revenues have increased from million in to million in to million in our operating loss decreased from million in to million in  but increased to million in  which included a million charge related to in process research and development acquired as part of the acquisition of cardiospectra 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since our inception  we have not been profitable for a full fiscal year  and we expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
in march  we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with ge  pursuant to which we are collaborating on the development and distribution of our si ge innova product  which is our ivus imaging system console that is installed directly into a cath lab on a permanent basis and is able to be integrated with ge s innova system 
under the terms of the agreement  ge has been granted exclusive distribution rights worldwide  excluding japan  for the si ge innova product for a period of months  subject to minimum purchase forecasts  and non exclusive distribution rights thereafter 
the month exclusivity period ended on august   after which  ge had non exclusive distribution rights worldwide  excluding japan  for our si product 
unless extended  or terminated earlier in accordance with its terms  the agreement will expire on december  ge s obligation to purchase products from us under the agreement is limited to firm purchase orders made by ge and accepted by us 
no minimum purchase requirements are required and the forecasts to be provided under the agreement will not be binding 
while we have not previously entered into a distribution arrangement that is similar to our agreement with ge  we believe our relationship with ge will enable us to increase sales of our consoles worldwide  excluding japan 

table of contents we completed an underwritten initial public offering on june  in which we sold  shares of our common stock to the public at an offering price of per share 
the initial public offering resulted in net proceeds of million  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
on december   we completed an underwritten follow on offering in which  shares of our common stock were sold by the company and  shares were sold by certain selling stockholders  including officers of the company 
in addition  we sold  shares under an over allotment option exercised by the underwriters 
the follow on offering  including the exercise of the over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
on october   we completed an underwritten follow on offering in which  shares of our common stock were sold by the company  including  shares under an over allotment option exercised by the underwriters 
the follow on offering  including the exercise of the over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
on december   we acquired cardiospectra  a company founded in and based in san antonio  texas 
cardiospectra s core product line is based on technology licensed from the university of texas and dr 
thomas milner  a co founder of cardiospectra 
through cardiospectra  we are developing innovative optical coherence tomography oct technology  which is expected to complement our existing product offerings and further enhance our position as an imaging technology leader in the field of interventional medicine 
financial operations overview the following is a description of the primary components of our revenue and expenses 
revenues 
we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of our ivus and fm consoles and single procedure disposables 
in  of our revenues were derived from the sale of our ivus consoles and ivus single procedure disposables  as compared with in and in in  of our revenues were derived from the sale of our ivus and fm single procedure disposables  as compared with in and in other revenues consist primarily of spare parts sales  service and maintenance revenues  shipping and handling revenues and license fees from medtronic  inc and certain of its affiliates  or medtronic  a related party 
our sales in the united states are generated by our direct sales representatives and our products are shipped and billed to hospitals throughout the united states from our facility in rancho cordova  california 
our international sales are generated by our direct sales representatives or through independent distributors and are shipped and billed throughout the world from our facilities in rancho cordova  california  zaventem  belgium and chiba  japan 
we experienced a significant increase in our revenues from compared with  with year over year growth evident in all product categories and all regions 
we expect to experience variability in our quarterly revenues from ivus and fm consoles due to the timing of hospital capital equipment purchasing decisions  a condition which is inherent in our industry 
further  we expect variability of our revenues based on the timing of our new product introductions which may cause our customers to delay their purchasing decisions until the new products are commercially available 
alternatively  we may include in our arrangements with customers an obligation to deliver new products which are not yet commercially available 
in these cases  we would be required to defer associated revenues from these customers until we have met our delivery obligations 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of material costs for the products that we sell and other costs associated with our manufacturing process such as personnel costs  rent and depreciation 
in addition  cost of revenues includes royalty expenses for licensed technologies included in our products  service costs  provisions for warranty  distribution  freight and packaging costs and stock compensation expense 
we expect our gross margin to improve if we are able to complete our ongoing efforts to streamline and improve our manufacturing processes and increase production volumes 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the sales  marketing  executive  finance  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs include travel and entertainment expenses  facility costs  trade show  training and other promotional expenses  professional fees for legal and accounting services and stock compensation expense 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand our sales force and marketing efforts and invest in the necessary infrastructure to support our continued growth 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  consultants  prototype materials  clinical studies  depreciation  regulatory filing fees  certain legal costs related to our intellectual property and stock compensation expense 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our products and technologies 
amortization of intangibles 
intangible assets  which consist of our developed technology  licenses  customer relationships  patents and trademarks  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to ten years 
interest income 
interest income is comprised of interest income earned from our cash and cash equivalents  short term available for sale investments 
interest expense 
interest expense is comprised primarily of interest expense on short term debt and term loans 
we expect interest expense in to decrease as we plan to continue to pay down our existing loan balances 
exchange rate gain loss 
exchange rate gain loss is comprised of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes is comprised of state  local and foreign income taxes 
due to uncertainty surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets through future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance and no current benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss and other deferred tax assets 
accordingly  deferred tax asset valuation allowances have been established as of december   and to reflect these uncertainties 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in  the state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and the foreign net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in  unless these net operating losses are previously utilized 
we also have federal research and experimentation tax credits  which begin to expire in  and state research and experimentation tax credits  which carry forward indefinitely 
use of our net operation loss carryforwards may be limited if cumulative change in ownership of more than has occurred within a rolling three year period

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in  as compared to revenues of million in in  a large part of our growth in revenues was derived from our ivus disposable products with a million increase in revenues attributable to higher sales volume of our single procedure disposable ivus products 
we attribute the increase in ivus disposable revenue to increased market penetration of ivus in interventional procedures and gains in our market share world wide 
additionally  for the year ended december   ivus console revenue increased million  or  as compared with the same period in the increase in ivus console revenue resulted primarily from an increase in the number of consoles sold 
increases in revenues were realized across all geographies 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in  from million  or of revenues in gross margin was of revenues in as compared to of revenues in the increase in gross margin percentage is largely due to an increase in the average selling price and a decrease in production cost of certain ivus catheters  as well as an increase in the average selling prices for certain fm disposables 
these factors were partially offset by average selling price reductions of si ivus consoles  higher warranty expense and higher shipping expense 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of revenues in  as compared to million  or of revenues in the increase in as compared with is a result of higher payroll related costs due to increased headcount  higher stock compensation expense  higher marketing expenses  primarily related to attendance at trade shows  and new product launches  and an increase in corporate expenditures  including costs associated with our reporting obligations as a public company  including compliance with sarbanes oxley 
research and development

in process research and development 
in process research and development was million in and relates to our acquisition of cardiospectra 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense was relatively unchanged at million  or of revenues in  as compared to million  or of revenues in interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to  or of revenues in  as compared to million  or of revenues in the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was attributable to lower average debt balances 
our average debt balances decreased primarily due to the repayment of million of our senior subordinated debt and the repayment of  of our short term debt in interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net was income of million in  as compared to million in the change in as compared to was primarily attributable to a gain of million on foreign exchange transactions in as compared to million in  and by higher interest income  earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments  of million in as compared to  in comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million in  as compared to revenues of million in in  substantially all of our growth in revenues was derived from our ivus disposable products with a million increase in revenues attributable to higher sales volume of our single procedure disposable ivus products  partially offset by a million decrease in ivus console sales 
increases in revenues were realized across all geographies 
we attribute the increase in ivus disposable revenue to increased market 
table of contents penetration of ivus in interventional procedures and gains in our market share world wide 
the decrease in ivus consoles in was due to a higher volume of console sales to goodman in  following the initiation of the sub distribution agreement by and among fukuda denshi  goodman and us in the first quarter of cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased million  or  to million  or of revenues in  from million  or of revenues in the decrease in cost of revenues in was partially due to the absence of a million charge in the fourth quarter of related to the write down of ivus ivg console inventory and related assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced the upcoming release of our new s family of ivus consoles to occur in in conjunction with the proposed new product introduction  we performed an assessment of the valuation of the inventory and other assets  including long lived assets  associated with the ivus ivg console 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded write downs for the excess and obsolete ivus ivg inventory of  impairment of ivus ivg diagnostic equipment in the amount of  and accruals related to future non cancelable ivus ivg inventory purchase commitments of million 
the decrease in the cost of revenues was also due to a shift away from the lower margin ivg ivus consoles to the higher margin s ivus consoles 
gross margin was of revenues in as compared to of revenues in the increase in gross margin is due to the million charge in the fourth quarter of relating to the ivus ivg product line and increased sales of higher margin s consoles in selling  general and administrative

amortization expense was relatively unchanged at million  or of revenues in  as compared to million  or of revenues in interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million  or of revenues in  as compared to million  or of revenues in the decrease in interest expense in as compared to was attributable to lower average debt balances 
our average debt balances decreased primarily due to the repayment of million of our senior subordinated debt and the repayment of  of our short term debt in partially offsetting the lower interest expense was a million charge in related to the expensing of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing fees  which resulted from the repayment of our senior subordinated notes in connection with our initial public offering 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net was income of million in  as compared to an expense of  in the change in as compared to was primarily attributable to a gain of million on foreign exchange transactions in as compared to a loss of  in  and by higher interest income  earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments  of  in as compared to  in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity at december   our cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments totaled million 
we invest our excess funds in short term securities issued by corporations  banks  municipalities and financial holding companies and in money market funds comprised of these same types of securities 
on june   we completed an underwritten initial public offering of  shares of our common stock  which included  shares sold pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
proceeds of the offering  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions were million 
pursuant to a subordinated debt agreement entered into in december  we repaid the outstanding balance of million on our senior subordinated notes  as required  with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
in addition  through december   million was used for other debt repayment  million was used for capital expenditures and  was used for the acquisition of intangibles 
the remaining net proceeds were used to help fund a portion of the acquisition of cardiospectra in december on december   we completed a follow on underwritten public offering in which  shares of our common stock were sold by the company and  shares were sold by certain selling stockholders  including officers of the company 
in addition  we sold  shares under an over allotment option exercised by the underwriters 
the follow on offering  including the exercise of the over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
on october   we completed a follow on offering in which  shares of our common stock were sold by the company  including  shares under an over allotment option exercised by the underwriters 
the follow on offering  including the exercise of the over allotment option  resulted in net proceeds to the company of million  after deducting offering expenses and underwriting discounts and commissions 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
since inception  we have generated significant operating losses and as a result we did not generate sufficient cash flow to fund our operations and the growth in our business 
accordingly  prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations and acquisitions primarily through the issuances of million of preferred stock  million of senior subordinated notes and million of term loans 
these issuances of equity and debt were supplemented with borrowings from our revolving credit facility and equipment financing arrangements 
in addition  in july  we financed a portion of our acquisition of certain ivus patents and technology by entering into a non interest bearing note with philips in the amount of million 
the issuances of our senior subordinated notes  term loans and our revolving credit facility included warrants to purchase our series b preferred stock  which automatically converted into warrants to purchase common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering  or our common stock 
in may our revolving credit facility expired as scheduled 
we are subject to several covenants that place restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt and liens  pay dividends and sell or dispose of any of our assets outside the normal course of business 
we are in compliance with all covenants and limitations included in the provisions of our loan agreements as of december  cash flows cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities of million for reflected our net loss of million  non cash investment accretion of million and a gain on foreign exchange of million 
in addition  accounts receivable increased million  inventory increased million and prepaid expenses and other current assets increased million 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to the increased sales volume and timing of cash receipts  the increase in inventory is due to anticipated increased sales volume and the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets is primarily due to payments made for future expenses 
these amounts were offset by non cash expenses consisting of a write off of in process research and development of million related to the acquisition of cardiospectra  depreciation and amortization of million and non cash stock compensation expense of million 
in addition  accounts payable increased million related to the increase in inventory and timing of payments  accrued compensation increased million  primarily due to 
table of contents increased headcount and salary deferrals for the employee stock purchase plan  and deferred revenue increased million 
cash used in operating activities of million for reflected our net loss of million and a non cash gain on foreign exchange of million  offset by adjustments for non cash expenses consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of million  interest capitalized as debt principal of million  stock compensation expense of million and the amortization and write off of debt discount and deferred financing fees of million 
in addition  accounts receivable increased million  inventory increased million  and accounts payable decreased million 
these uses of cash are due to the timing of cash receipts and payments  as well as the increase in sales and manufacturing activity 
these uses of cash were partially offset by a million increase in accrued compensation expense resulting from an increase in accrued commissions  as a result of higher sales  and increased relocation costs 
cash provided by operating activities of million for reflected our net loss of million  offset by adjustments for non cash expenses consisting primarily of depreciation and amortization of million  interest capitalized as debt principal of million and stock compensation expense of million 
in addition  accounts receivable increased million and inventories increased million reflecting higher sales and manufacturing activity in  as well as purchases of components for new product introductions 
these uses of cash were offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  resulting from the higher sales and manufacturing activity in  as well as purchases of components for new product introductions  higher accrued compensation costs reflecting continued growth in our employee headcount  and a million accrual for losses on non cancelable ivus ivg inventory purchase commitments 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  million was used to purchase short term available for sale securities  million was used to purchase cardiospectra and million was used for purchases of long term assets including capital expenditures for medical diagnostic equipment and manufacturing equipment 
these purchases were partially offset by million from the sale or maturity of short term available for sale investments 
in  million was used to purchase short term available for sale investments and million was primarily related to purchases of long term assets  including capital expenditures for medical diagnostic equipment and manufacturing equipment 
cash used in investing activities during was primarily related to capital expenditures for medical diagnostic equipment  manufacturing equipment  the upgrade of our computer system and the expansion of our manufacturing and research and development facilities 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of million in proceeds from our underwritten follow on public offering 
cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of the million in net proceeds from our initial public offering and follow on offering  partially offset by repayment of debt of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds from the sale of preferred stock  the issuance of debt and the sale of common stock  partially offset by the repayment of debt 
future liquidity needs our future liquidity and capital requirements will be influenced by numerous factors  including the extent and duration of future operating losses  the level and timing of future sales and expenditures  the results and scope of ongoing research and product development programs  working capital required to support our sales growth  the receipt of and time required to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals  our sales and marketing programs  the continuing acceptance of our products in the marketplace  competing technologies and market and regulatory developments 
as of december   we believe our current cash and cash equivalents and our short term available for sale investments will be sufficient to fund working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and operations for at least the next months 
we intend to retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the growth and development of our business  and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future 

table of contents our ability to fund our longer term cash needs is subject to various risks  many of which are beyond our control see risk factors 
should we require additional funding  such as additional capital investments  we may need to raise the required additional funds through bank borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
we cannot assure that such funding will be available in needed quantities or on terms favorable to us 
as of december   we have federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income if we become profitable 
we expect to utilize our available net operating loss carryforwards to reduce future tax obligations in the event we are successful in achieving profitability 
however  limitations on our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and other minimum state taxes may increase our overall tax obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements and other contractual obligations in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification to business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
as of december   we have not incurred any costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  for each of the periods indicated in thousands payment due by period less more than than contractual obligations and commercial commitments total year years years years debt interest on debt capital lease obligations including interest operating lease obligations minimum payments under license agreements non cancelable purchase commitments total future interest payments on our debt are based on the assumption that the debt is outstanding until maturity and all interest expense has been calculated for all future periods using the rate implicit in the respective debt agreements 
we lease office space and have entered into other lease commitments in the united states as well as locations in europe and asia 
operating lease obligations include future minimum lease payments under all our non cancelable operating leases as of december  our license agreements include provisions that require us to make milestone or royalty payments to the licensor based on the amount of future sales of covered products 
certain of these agreements require that the royalties we pay in a given year total at least a minimum amount as set forth in the agreements 
the royalty obligations we may incur in excess of these minimum amounts are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine the timing or amount of these obligations 
consists of non cancelable commitments primarily for the purchase of production materials 
the table above does not include potential milestone payments up to an aggregate of million due to the former shareholders of cardiospectra see acquisitions note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 

table of contents critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our products is generally recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer upon shipment  the terms of which is generally free on board shipping point 
we use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement 
we use shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify that title has transferred 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the agreement associated with the transaction 
to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables  and for these we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we are required to make judgments which impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
for example  because the sale of our products and services are often contemplated in a single arrangement  we make judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from the arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
in addition  our ability to establish and maintain objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the elements in our arrangements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
the elements of a typical revenue arrangement can include a console  options for the console  single procedure disposable products and a service and maintenance agreement 
we occasionally enter into agreements requiring cash payments to partners who are also customers 
we apply the provisions of eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer  to account for cash payments made under these agreements 
inventory valuation 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined on a first in  first out basis 
we provide inventory allowances when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to obsolescence and reductions in estimated future demand 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory reserves that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when we sell products 
valuation of long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment and intangible assets 
equipment is carried at cost and is depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are generally three to five years  and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  which is between three and ten years 
the straight line method is used for depreciation and amortization 
intangible assets primarily consist of developed technology  customer relationships  licenses  and patents and trademarks  which are amortized using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to ten years  representing the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we capitalize external legal costs and filing fees associated with obtaining patents on our new discoveries and amortize these costs using the straight line method over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its economic life  generally ten years 
acquired intellectual property is recorded at cost and is amortized over its estimated useful life 
we believe the useful lives we assigned to these assets are reasonable 
we consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
these indicators may include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of an asset and significant changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used 
if these or other indicators are present  we determine whether the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question are less than 
table of contents their carrying value 
if less than their carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
the evaluation of asset impairments relative to long lived assets require us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated which requires significant judgment 
actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we began accounting for share based awards under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we used the intrinsic method of accounting for employee stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and presented disclosure of pro forma information required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas no 
for stock options granted to employees under apb no 
 no compensation expense was recognized unless the exercise price was less than the estimated fair market value at the date of grant 
we apply the provisions of eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods and services  and use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of each option grant to non employees 
see stockholders equity deficit note to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of the common stock for options granted through march  was originally determined by our board of directors  with input from management 
we did not obtain contemporaneous valuations by an unrelated valuation specialist in connection with these grants 
instead  we relied on our board of directors  the members of which we believe have extensive experience in the medical device market and are accredited venture capital investors  to determine a reasonable estimate of the then current fair value of our common stock 
since there was no public market for our shares  our board of directors exercised judgment in determining the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant based on several factors  including transactions in our preferred and common stock  the rights and benefits that preferred stock holders are entitled to that holders of our common stock are not  key milestones achieved in our business including forecasted revenues and cash flows  product development and market acceptance  our financial condition  equity market conditions  and the likelihood of continuing as a going concern 
based on these factors  we granted options for the period from january  through march  at exercise prices ranging from to 
subsequently  we reassessed the valuations of our common stock relating to options granted beginning with the fiscal year 
as part of this reassessment  our board of directors obtained retrospective valuations prepared by management  which management believes follows substantially the same methodology used by valuation specialists as outlined in the aicpa s practice aid valuation of privately held company equity securities issues as compensation 
based on these retrospective valuations  the fair value of the common stock underlying options granted in the period from january  through march  was determined to be from to 
in addition to the factors discussed above which our board of directors considered in determining the estimated fair value of our common stock  they also considered the market release of a new ivus catheter in early  the sale of our series c preferred stock to accredited investors in early  the expansion of our japanese distribution channel in early and the potential impact that liquidity events would have on us such as an initial public offering  a merger or sale with another company  or the forced liquidation of our company 

table of contents the procedures performed as part of the retrospective valuations for determining the fair value of our common stock were based on a probability weighted combination of the market multiple approach and income approach to estimate the aggregate equity value at specific stock option grant dates 
the market multiple approach was based on revenues  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  and net income considered to be representative of our future performance  and multiplying these figures by a range of appropriate risk adjusted multiples 
the market multiples were obtained through the market comparison method  where companies having their stock traded in the public market were used as a basis for choosing reasonable market multiples 
the income approach involves applying appropriate discount rates to estimated debt free cash flows that are based on forecasts of our revenue and costs 
the projections used for each valuation date were based on the expected outlook on our operating performance through the forecast periods 
the assumptions underlying the estimates were consistent with our board of directors approved business plan 
the future debt free cash flows were determined by subtracting from ebitda taxes and future capital spending and adjusting for future changes in net working capital 
the interim debt free cash flows and resulting terminal value were then discounted at a rate based on the weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies  as adjusted for our specific risk profile 
there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates 
if different discount rates had been used  the valuations would have been different 
after estimating our average value based on the market multiple and income approaches  we then utilized a probability weighted expected return method 
under the probability weighted expected return method  the value of our common stock was estimated based upon an analysis of values assuming various outcomes  such as an initial public offering  merger or sale  forced liquidation  and remaining private  and the estimated probability of each outcome assuming that all preferred stock is converted into common stock 
from april until our initial public offering in june  our board of directors obtained contemporaneous valuations prepared by management which follow the same procedures as those used in the retrospective valuations described above 
in addition to the factors discussed above  our board of directors considered specific business milestones including the introduction of vh ivus functionality for our ivus ivg consoles in may  the sale of common stock to two new independent members of the board of directors in the fourth quarter of and the initial release of our new s console in late in addition  we considered the events occurring late in concerning our potential initial public offering  including our meetings with potential investment bankers 

table of contents for financial reporting purposes for the period from january  through december   for options granted to employees we recorded deferred stock based compensation under apb no 
representing the difference between the estimated fair value of common stock and the option exercise price 
beginning january   with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recorded stock based compensation based upon estimated fair values 
the following table shows information concerning all options granted during the period january  through december  fair value of number of options option exercise common stock on intrinsic value per granted price grant date share grant date grants january january april june july october total grants grants february may july november total grants grants january april june july october december total grants the estimated fair values for january  have been determined based upon retrospective valuations prepared by management and the estimated fair values shown for the period april  through the date of our initial public offering are based upon contemporaneous valuations prepared by management 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and directors under apb no 
 we recorded an aggregate of million in deferred stock based compensation  with respect to stock options granted through december  in total  we amortized million of deferred stock compensation into expense through december  as of december   our deferred stock compensation under apb no 
was million 
as required under sfas r  the million in deferred stock compensation was reversed in january at december   we therefore had no remaining deferred stock compensation 
prior to our initial public offering in june  the determination of the fair value of our common stock involved significant judgments  assumptions  estimates and complexities that impacted the amount of deferred stock based compensation recorded under apb no 
and the resulting amortization in future periods 
under sfas no 
r  we have used the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards which requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility  expected life and forfeiture rates 
if we had made different assumptions  the amount of our deferred stock based compensation  stock based compensation expense  gross margin  net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different 
we believe 
table of contents that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions to determine the fair value of our common stock and that deferred stock based compensation and related amortization were recorded properly for accounting purposes 
if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
under sfas no 
and sfas r  the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model utilizing the following weighted average assumptions years ended december  risk free interest rate expected life years estimated volatility factor expected dividends none none none the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the implied yield available on us treasury constant rate securities with the same or substantially equivalent remaining terms at the time of grant 
for options granted prior to january   and valued in accordance with sfas no 
 the expected life of our stock options was based upon the historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the share based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
we recognized option forfeitures as they occurred as allowed by sfas no 
estimated volatility was calculated using the implied volatility of the common stock of comparable medical device companies 
for options granted after january   and valued in accordance with sfas no 
r  we adopted a temporary shortcut approach as permitted by sab no 
to develop an expected life of an employee stock option 
under this approach  the expected life is presumed to be the mid point between the vesting date and the contractual end of the option term 
we estimate forfeitures and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
our estimated forfeiture rates in the years ended december  and are based on our historical forfeiture experience 
estimated volatility under sfas no 
r is calculated using the trading history of the common stock of comparable medical device companies 
in the year ended december   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain non employee stock options representing options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the acceleration of the vesting of these options  we recorded charges totaling  in the year ended december  as of december   we had approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost remaining to be amortized over a weighted average term of years 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our deferred tax assets are determined by multiplying the differences between the financial reporting and tax reporting bases for assets and liabilities by the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the realization of our deferred tax assets  which had a gross carrying value of million at december   is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reflect the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax benefits  given our historical losses 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence needs to be considered  including our past and future performance  the market environment in which we operate  the utilization of tax attributes in the past  and the length of carryforward periods and evaluation of potential tax planning strategies 
we expect to continue to maintain a full valuation allowance until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained or we 
table of contents are able to develop tax strategies that would enable us to conclude that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets would be realizable 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no  fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and we will adopt sfas beginning january  we are currently assessing the potential impact the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred  eg  debt issue costs 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we will adopt sfas for our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently determining whether fair value accounting is appropriate for any of the eligible items and we cannot estimate the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r will change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas no 
r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r will change the accounting treatment and disclosure for certain specific items in a business combination 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
we are still assessing the impact of this pronouncement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas no 
sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we have not completed our evaluation of the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our historical results of operations  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our results of operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
fluctuations in interest rates and the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro  could adversely affect our financial results 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to the investment of our excess cash into highly liquid financial investments 
as of december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments consisting of highly liquid financial investments with original maturities of one year or less 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million for these investments 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash equivalents and short term available for sale investments 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we have assessed that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from them 
foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk related to our european operations  including euro denominated intercompany receivables 
because our intercompany receivables are accounted for in euros  any appreciation or devaluation of the euro will result in a gain or loss to the consolidated statements of operations
