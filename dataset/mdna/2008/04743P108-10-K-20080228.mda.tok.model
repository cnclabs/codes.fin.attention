in august  we began shipping our low cost  universal serial bus usb solution for wlan which we obtained through our acquisition of zydas technology corporation 
zydas was a privately held  taiwan based integrated circuit design company specializing in high performance wlan semiconductor and software solutions and in conjunction with the acquisition  it became the atheros taiwan development center 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement  we paid an aggregate of approximately million in cash and stock at closing and agreed to pay additional consideration upon attaining certain defined milestones 
the results of operations of zydas have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the date of acquisition 
in december  we acquired of the outstanding shares of attansic technology corporation  a privately held taiwan based fabless integrated circuit design company  specializing in gigabit and fast ethernet integrated circuit solutions  as well as power management products 
under the terms of the share purchase agreement  we paid an aggregate of approximately million in cash and stock 
we acquired the remaining of attansic s outstanding shares in november for approximately million 
in december  we began shipping the ethernet solutions acquired from attansic for personal computer applications 
our ethernet solutions are integrated into personal computer lan on motherboards lom by supplying gigabit ethernet network interface card nic and physical layer phy products for loms 
in january  we sold certain assets related to the legacy power management business of attansic to a third party 
the results of operations for attansic have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since december  net of minority interest 
since november  of the results of operations of attansic have been included in our consolidated statement of operations 
we have provided certain supplemental pro forma information for the acquisition of attansic in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
during  we introduced our first single chip  cmos bluetooth solutions targeting the personal computing market and headset markets 
these solutions support the bluetooth enhanced data rate standard and leverage our expertise in rf design and integration to deliver a highly compact  low power design for use in a variety of bluetooth enabled devices 

table of contents in december  we acquired certain of the assets and liabilities from u nav microelectronics corporation  or u nav  a privately held fabless semiconductor company specializing in gps chipsets and software that enable mobile location based products and services 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  we paid an aggregate of million in cash  stock and assumed liabilities 
in january  we began shipping the gps solutions acquired from u nav for personal navigation devices pnds 
the results of operations from the u nav acquisition have been included in our consolidated statements of operations since the date of acquisition 
revenue 
our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of wlan  ethernet and pas chipsets and to a lesser extent  from licensed software and services 
in addition  we have introduced bluetooth and gps semiconductor products that we anticipate will generate revenue in our sales have historically been made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
original equipment manufacturers oems  utilize our chipsets in developing their wireless system solutions such as access points  routers  embedded laptop clients  handsets  cardbus  minicard  pnds and headsets 
oems also utilize our ethernet chip solutions in developing local area network lan solutions such as loms 
oems use our pas chip solutions for the development of pas network handheld phones 
some oems purchase chipsets directly from us and manufacture their products 
other oems utilize original design manufacturers odms to design and build subsystem products that the oem then purchases from the odm and incorporates into the oem s system solution 
accordingly  we ship our products either directly to the oem or to the odm based on the requirements of each oem 
purchase orders are received from an oem or an odm and we generally recognize revenue based on the shipment of chipsets to this customer 
a single odm usually provides our chipsets to numerous oems 
however  we attempt to maintain a close relationship with the target oem to monitor end market demand 
due to the use of odms  our direct customer base is relatively concentrated  although we believe that the number of total oems who purchase our chipsets through odms is broader 
we anticipate that we may continue to experience changes in our odm customer base as our end customers change odms for a variety of reasons while still using our chipsets 
we provide customer incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual sales data submitted by the customers differs significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue in particular periods 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related cost of goods sold on shipments to distributors that have rights of return or price protection privileges on unsold products until the products are sold by the distributors to their customers 
price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit in the event of declines in the price of our products 
we expect to continue to have major concentrations of sales to a relatively small number of odm and oem customers 
the following table shows the customers that represented greater than of revenue for the years ended december   and december  hon hai precision industry co 
ltd 
utstarcom  inc alpha networks  inc cameo communications  inc askey computer corporation less than in the applicable period 

table of contents substantially all of our sales are to customers outside the united states and canada 
sales to customers in asia accounted for  and of net revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
because many of our odm customers are located in asia  we anticipate that a majority of our revenue will continue to come from sales to customers in that region 
although a large percentage of our sales are made to customers in asia  we believe that a significant number of the systems designed by these customers are then sold through to oems outside of asia 
all of our sales are denominated in united states dollars 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold relates primarily to the purchase of silicon wafers  costs associated with assembly  test and inbound and outbound shipping of our chipsets  costs of personnel  materials and occupancy associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  royalty costs and write downs to state inventory at the lower of cost or market caused by product obsolescence and transitions from older to newer products 
additionally  our cost of goods sold includes accruals for warranty obligations  which we record when revenue is recognized 
because we do not have long term  fixed supply agreements  our wafer  assembly and test costs are subject to changes based on the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
in addition  after we purchase wafers from foundries  we also typically bear the yield risk related to manufacturing these wafers into finished goods 
we expect our future cost of goods sold to fluctuate based on the volume of chipsets shipped and the resulting product mix  which contains products with varying levels of costs per chip 
research and development 
research and development expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs related to development employees and contractors  mask and reticle costs  prototype wafers  software and computer aided design software licenses  intellectual property license costs  reference design development costs  development testing and evaluation costs  regulatory testing costs  depreciation expense and allocated occupancy costs 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect our research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we invest to develop new products to be competitive and address new markets in the future 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  public relations  promotional and other marketing expenses  expenses for travel  trade shows and depreciation  resource planning software and allocated occupancy costs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and expand our sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense relates primarily to compensation and associated costs for general and administrative personnel  professional fees and banking fees  charges related to allowance for doubtful accounts  resource planning software and allocated occupancy costs 
we expect that general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars as we hire additional personnel and incur costs related to the anticipated growth of our business 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets relates to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in the zydas  attansic and u nav acquisitions 
acquisition related identified intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to four years for purchased technology  two to six years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
acquired in process research and development 
acquired in process research and development relates to the in process research and development expensed upon the acquisition of zydas  attansic and u nav  as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
interest income  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities balances 

table of contents impairment of long term marketable securities 
impairment of long term marketable securities relates to the other than temporary  non operating write down of the carrying value of our investments in auction rate securities  such securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
while we have received all interest payments due on these instruments on a timely basis  we have determined that these assets have been other than temporarily impaired and should be classified as long term marketable securities 
since each of these securities had been subject to auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates and the auctions have subsequently failed  we have used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of these investments as of december  see the discussion in liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in part ii  item a  as well as note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for more detailed information on our investments in auction rate securities and this impairment charge 
provision for income taxes 
we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expenses for tax and financial statement purposes and the realizability of assets in future years 
we recorded a net income tax expense of million  million  and a net income tax benefit of million  for  and  respectively 
these amounts included income tax benefits of million  million  and million  for  and  respectively  related to releases of valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from the sale of our communication integrated circuits ics 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for the products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
we provide incentives to some of our direct and indirect customers 
these obligations are estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time at which we ship product to the customers in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
table of contents including a reseller of the vendor s products 
estimated incentive amounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and are based on agreements between us and our customers 
estimating incentive amounts requires that we make estimates regarding the percentage of committed incentives that will be submitted by our customers and the value of the incentives at the time of redemption 
these estimates may require revisions at later dates if the actual claims submitted by the customers differ significantly from the original estimates  which may have the effect of increasing or decreasing net revenue and gross profit as a percentage of revenue in a particular period 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related cost of goods sold on shipments to distributors that have rights of return or price protection privileges on unsold products until the products are sold by the distributor to its customers 
price protection rights grant distributors the right to a credit in the event of declines in the price of our products 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we believe that the carrying amounts of the financial instruments approximate their respective fair market values due to their short maturities 
when there is no readily available market data  we may make fair value estimates  which may not necessarily represent the amounts that could be realized in a current or future sale of these assets 
marketable securities 
we classify marketable securities as available for sale 
we view our available for sale portfolio as available for use in current operations 
accordingly  we have classified all investments with a readily available market as short term  even though the maturity dates may be one year or more beyond the current balance sheet date  because of the intent to sell these securities prior to maturity to meet liquidity needs or as part of a risk management program 
when we find that a readily available market does not currently exist for the securities  we classify these securities as long term due to the potential inability to sell the securities within one year of the current balance sheet date 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value  and we record temporary unrealized holding gains and losses as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
we charge unrealized losses against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sec staff accounting bulletin topic m  other than temporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities and financial accounting standards board fasb staff position fsp  financial accounting standards fas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  we review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary 
these factors include but are not limited to the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss position  the extent to which fair value is less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and  our intent and ability to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
realized gains and losses are accounted for on the specific identification method 
inventory valuation 
we continually assess the recoverability of our inventory based on assumptions about demand and market conditions 
forecasted demand is determined based on historical sales and expected future sales 
we value our inventory at the lower of actual cost using the first in  first out method or its current estimated market value 
we reduce our inventory to the estimated lower of cost or market value to account for its obsolescence or lack of marketability 
reductions are calculated as the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
stock based compensation 
prior to january   we elected to follow the intrinsic value based method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 
table of contents and related interpretations in accounting for employee stock options rather than adopting the alternative fair value accounting provided under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
therefore  we did not record any compensation expense for stock options we granted to our employees where the exercise price equaled the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant and the exercise price  number of shares eligible for issuance under the options and vesting period were fixed 
we complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures  which require that we disclose our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per common share as if we had expensed the fair value of the options 
effective january  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  using the modified prospective application method 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation expense for stock based awards granted by us as a public company prior to  but not yet vested as of january   is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provision of sfas no 
for stock based awards granted before november  the date on which we filed our registration statement for our initial public offering  we continue to record compensation expense following the provisions of apb stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted after december  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december  there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans  net of estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black sholes option valuation model and the assumptions used shown in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we estimate the expected term of options based on the expected terms of similar entities since we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of our stock option awards 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on considerations of the implied volatility of long term options traded on the open market and our average historical volatilities and those of similar entities since we do not have sufficient historical volatility to be able to make that determination based solely on our equity instruments 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits and their credit worthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience  our anticipation of uncollectible accounts receivable and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our receivables are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers 
therefore  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer could make collection of our accounts receivable more difficult  require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and negatively affect our working capital 
product warranty provision 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our chipset suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  the cost of replacement chipsets and inbound and outbound freight costs incurred in replacing a chipset after failure 
we continuously monitor chipset returns for warranty and maintain an accrual for the related warranty expenses based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual failure rates  cost of chipset replacement and inbound and outbound freight costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual would be required 
any such revisions may have the effect of increasing or decreasing gross profit as a percentage of revenue in a particular period in which these estimates are adjusted 

table of contents income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  projections of future income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of tax benefits  classification on the balance sheet  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position  as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently  affect our operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we record goodwill when the consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we amortize acquisition related identified intangibles on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives of three to four years for purchased technology  two to six years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we measure and test goodwill on an annual basis on october or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exit 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step requires comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
we have one reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of the reporting unit by taking the market capitalization of the reporting unit as determined through quoted market prices 
a potential impairment exists if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its net book value 
we only perform the second step of the process if a potential impairment exists  and it involves determining the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets other than goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit and if the difference is less than the net book value of goodwill  impairment exists and is recorded 
we have not been required to perform this second step of the process since our adoption of sfas no 
because the fair value of the reporting unit has exceeded the net book value at every measurement date 
long lived assets 
we account for long lived assets  including other purchased intangible assets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using quoted market prices or discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in fasb concepts statement no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
our estimates regarding future anticipated net revenue and cash flows  the remaining economic life of the products and technologies  or both  
table of contents may differ from those used to assess the recoverability of assets 
in that event  impairment charges or shortened useful lives of certain long lived assets may be required  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase to net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
litigation and settlement costs 
recently  we have been involved in litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation including any potential substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the determination of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or to obtain a license under the opposing party s intellectual property rights  which could adversely impact our profitability in future periods  or prevent us from selling certain of our products or to cease in the development of a certain type of technology 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we would record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency if information available prior to issuance of financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
actual liabilities in any such disputes or litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs

as a result  the total number of chipsets shipped approximately doubled in compared to the increase in revenue attributed to the increase in chipsets shipped was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of these shipped chipsets as we aggressively priced our products to pursue market share and we experienced increased demand for our ethernet chipsets  which carry a lower average selling price compared to our wlan and pas products 

table of contents gross profit years ended december  change in gross profit of net revenue gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased in the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of a greater concentration in higher margin products as a percentage of our total product mix  partially offset by a decline in the overall blended selling prices of our products shipped 
we have been able to offset declines in average selling prices with supply chain efficiencies as the number of chipsets shipped in approximately doubled 
we expect that our gross margin percentage will increase in the first quarter of compared to the annual gross margin percentage  based primarily on the continued benefit from existing supply chain efficiencies and the anticipated product mix  but on a sequential quarterly basis we expect our gross margin percentage will decline 
research and development years ended december  change in research and development of net revenue the increase in research and development expenses of million was partly due to additional compensation related costs of million  primarily attributable to a increase in the number of employees engaged in research and development activities in to support our growth 
the headcount increase was due primarily to an expansion of our research and development personnel in our five design centers and to a lesser extent  the additional headcount acquired as part of the u nav acquisition 
of the increase in compensation related expenses  million was due to the increase in stock based compensation 
further  there were increases in software expenses of million  tapeout costs of million  product development and testing component expenses of million and depreciation expense of million  primarily due to increased chip development efforts for new and existing markets

we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will remain materially flat in absolute dollars in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of amortization of acquired intangible assets years ended december  change in amortization of acquired intangible assets of net revenue during  we recorded a total of million in charges related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets from the zydas  attansic and u nav acquisitions 
acquisition related identified intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to four years for purchased technology  two to six years for customer relationships and two to four years for covenants not to compete 
the identified intangible assets of million acquired from the u nav acquisition are preliminary estimates and are subject to subsequent revisions upon finalization of the valuation analysis 
amortization of acquired intangible assets in included amortization for acquired intangible assets resulting from the zydas and attansic acquisitions for a partial year 
in  amortization included a full year of amortization resulting from the zydas and attansic acquisitions and only a partial year from the u nav acquisition 
acquired in process research and development years ended december  change in acquired in process research and development of net revenue the acquired in process research and development ipr d charges for related to the acquisitions of the remaining of the capital stock of attansic and u nav  and charges in related to the initial acquisition of of the capital stock of attansic and zydas 
the amounts allocated to ipr d  were determined through estimates and valuation techniques based on the terms and details of each acquisition the amounts allocated to ipr d were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future use existed at the date of acquisition 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of an asset 
it incorporates the calculation of the present value of future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  tax deductions and proceeds from disposition 
indications are developed by discounting expected cash flows to the present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for the use of funds  the expected rate of inflation and risks associated with the particular investment 
the discount rate selected is generally based on the rate of return available from alternative investments of similar type and quality 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 

table of contents the ipr d charges include only the fair value of ipr d performed as of the respective acquisition dates 
the fair value of any developed technology is included in intangible assets and is amortized accordingly 
the amounts recorded as ipr d represent the estimated fair values and approximate amounts at which an independent third party would value these projects as of the respective acquisition dates

actual results to date have been materially consistent with our assumptions at the time of the acquisitions 
the assumptions consist of expected completion dates for the iprd projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  and revenue and expense projects for the product once they have entered the market 
interest income  net years ended december  change in interest income  net of net revenue during the year ended december   we experienced increased interest income compared to the same period in  partly due to a million increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  resulting primarily from the generation of cash from operations  the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases through our employee stock purchase plan 
this increase was partly offset by cash outlays for the acquisitions of the remaining outstanding shares of attansic  the u nav acquisition and for capital equipment 
the effect on interest income of the increased cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was partially offset by decreased yields achieved on our investment portfolio in the year ended over the same period in impairment of long term marketable securities during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the auction rate securities we hold

as a result  the total number of chipsets shipped approximately doubled in compared to the increase in chipsets shipped was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price as we aggressively priced our products to pursue market share

our financing activities provided cash of million  million and million in each of  and  respectively 
cash provided from financing activities in  and was primarily due to the exercise of employee options to purchase our common stock and purchases of our common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
we have a revolving credit facility at a bank that provides financing up to million for working capital requirements 
the credit facility is scheduled to expire in march  but we anticipate that we will renew the facility for another year 
in  we issued a standby letter of credit for million to secure an operating lease for equipment  which we reduced to million in this reduced the amount available to borrow at december  to million 
in january  we issued another standby letter of credit of  to secure an additional operating lease  which further reduced the amount available to borrow to million 
at december   no balances were outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is calculated at the bank s prime rate 
the revolving credit facility is collateralized by all of our tangible assets and the agreement contains financial and non financial covenants with which we must comply 
through december   we were in compliance with all required covenants 
long term marketable securities consist of auction rate securities representing our interest in insurance capital notes  issued by special purpose entities sponsored by insurance companies  such securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
a portion of these securities are collateralized by tradable short term corporate and government notes  bonds and commercial paper 
liquidity for these securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every days 
because of the short interest rate reset period  we have historically recorded them as current available for sale securities 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
as of december   we held auction rate securities with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million  which resulted in a million other than temporary impairment 
each of these securities had been subject to auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates 
we have re classified these auction rate securities as long term available for sale securities as of december  we believe we have the ability to hold these securities for longer than a period of twelve months 

table of contents we expect to experience a significant increase in our operating expenses in absolute dollars  particularly in research  and development but also in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business strategy 
as a result  we anticipate that operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
we believe that research and development is essential to expanding our core technologies and product offerings 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these expenditures resulted in enhancement of our product offerings  technological know how and inventions that have yielded numerous issued and pending us patents 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses and intend to fund these expenses with operating cash flow  cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities and amounts available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
in august  we acquired zydas for an aggregate of approximately million in cash and stock at closing and agreed to pay additional consideration upon attaining certain defined milestones 
certain of these milestones were met as of december  and the respective payments have been made and have been recorded as compensation expense 
in november  we acquired the remaining of the outstanding shares of attansic for approximately million in cash 
in december  we acquired of the outstanding shares of attansic for million consisting of million in cash and million in our common stock 
in december  we acquired u nav for approximately million in cash  stock and assumed liabilities 
we may enter into arrangements in the future with respect to potential investments in  acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing and there is no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec regulations 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions payments due by period less than year years after years total contractual obligations operating leases commitments under licensing agreements purchase of goods and services total 
table of contents we have excluded million in fin liabilities from the contractual obligations table because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the periodic cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our future consolidated financial statements  but we do not believe that it will have a material effect 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits an entity to elect to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value requiring that unrealized gains and losses be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for annual financial statements for the first fiscal year beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our future consolidated financial statements  but we do not believe that it will have a material effect 
in june the fasb ratified eitf no 
 or eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf requires non refundable advance payments for goods and services to be used in future research and development activities to be recorded as an asset and the payments to be expensed when the research and development activities are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we believe sfas no 
r may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  depending on the size and nature of any future business combinations that we may enter into 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are  in order of importance  to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   our investments were in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate notes  corporate bonds  auction rate securities and us government securities 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
our long term marketable securities consist of auction rate securities  which have been classified as long term due to the lack of a liquid market for these securities 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we believe that a change in interest rates will not have a significant impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on our interest income 
long term marketable securities consist of auction rate securities representing our interest in insurance capital notes  issued by special purpose entities sponsored by insurance companies  such securities were rated aaa and aa at the date of purchase 
a portion of these securities are collateralized by tradable short term corporate and government notes  bonds and commercial paper 
liquidity for these securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every days 
because of the short interest rate reset period  we have historically recorded them as current available for sale securities 
the liquidity and fair value of these securities has been negatively impacted by the uncertainty in the credit markets and the exposure of these securities to the financial condition of bond insurance companies 
as of december   we held auction rate securities with a par value of million and an estimated fair value of million  resulting in a million other than temporary impairment 
each of these securities had been subject to auction processes for which there had been insufficient bidders on the scheduled rollover dates 
we will not be able to liquidate any of our remaining auction rate securities until a future auction is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the notes are redeemed 
we have re classified these auction rate securities as long term available for sale securities as of december  we believe we have the ability to hold these securities for longer than a period of months 
we have determined that as of january  the fair value of our auction rate securities have further declined by an additional million  reducing the estimated fair value to approximately million 
we expect the estimated fair value of these securities could decrease or increase significantly in the future based on market conditions 
as a result  we currently expect to record an additional impairment charge during the quarter ending march   the amount of which will depend on the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities as of march  in future periods  the estimated fair value of our auction rate securities could decline further based on market conditions  which could result in additional impairment charges 
these charges could be substantial 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and marketable securities in thousands  except percentages that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of december  our variable rate securities consist entirely of auction rate securities 
this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
maturing in three months or less maturing between three months and one year maturing greater than one year total fixed rate weighted average interest rate variable rate weighted average interest rate 
table of contents our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility provides financing up to million for working capital requirements 
in  we issued a standby letter of credit for million to secure an operating lease for equipment  which was subsequently reduced to  in january  we issued another standby letter of credit for  to secure an addition operating lease for equipment 
these standby letters of credit have reduced the amount available to borrow under this credit facility from million to million 
at december   no balances were outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
the loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate 
we do not believe that a change in the prime rate would have a significant impact on our interest expense 
our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations is currently minimal 
our sales agreements generally provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
the risk associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates is limited to our operating expenses and capital expenditures denominated in currencies other than the united states dollar and we believe that a change in currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the fair value of our operating expenses or capital expenditures 
increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more or less expensive  which could have an impact on our business 
future fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our business 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  nor do we believe that we have a material exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk
