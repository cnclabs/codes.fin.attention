this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are not historical facts  but rather are based on current expectations  estimates  assumptions and projections about our industry  business and future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed under risk factors in part i  item a above 
business overview we design  develop and market innovative networking products that address the specific needs of small business and home users 
we define small business as a business with fewer than employees 
we are focused on satisfying the ease of use  reliability  performance and affordability requirements of these users 
our product offerings enable users to share internet access  peripherals  files  digital multimedia content and applications among multiple networked devices and other internet enabled devices 
our product line consists of wired and wireless devices that enable ethernet networking  broadband access  and network connectivity 
these products are available in multiple configurations to address the needs of our end users in each geographic region in which our products are sold 
we sell our networking products through multiple sales channels worldwide  including traditional retailers  online retailers  wholesale distributors  dmrs  vars  and broadband service providers 
our retail channel includes traditional retail locations domestically and internationally  such as best buy  circuit city  fry s electronics  radio shack  staples  argos uk  dixons uk  pc world uk  mediamarkt germany  austria  and fnac france 
online retailers include amazon 
com  dell  newegg 
com and buy 
com 
our dmrs include cdw corporation  insight corporation and pc connection in domestic markets and misco throughout europe 
in addition  we also sell our products through broadband service providers  such as multiple system operators in domestic markets and cable and dsl operators internationally 
some of these retailers and resellers purchase directly from us while most are fulfilled through wholesale distributors around the world 
a substantial portion of our net revenue to date has been derived from a limited number of wholesale distributors  the largest of which are ingram micro inc and tech data corporation 
we expect that these wholesale distributors will continue to contribute a significant percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
we have well developed channels in the united states and europe  middle east and africa  or emea  and are building a strong presence in the asia pacific region 
we derive the majority of our net revenue from international sales 
international sales as a percentage of net revenue remained constant at in and international sales grew from million in to million in  representing an increase of approximately during that period 
we continue to penetrate new markets such as brazil  eastern europe  india  and the middle east 

table of contents our net revenue grew during the year ended december  primarily attributable to increased shipments in our dsl gateway and cable gateway products to new and existing service provider customers  stronger worldwide switch sales  as well as sales of our readynas products  which were acquired in connection with our may  acquisition of infrant technologies  inc infrant 
we have also experienced growth in wireless n router sales 
the small business and home networking markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect our competition to continue to intensify 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the small business and home markets for networking products include product breadth  size and scope of the sales channel  brand name  timeliness of new product introductions  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  ease of installation  maintenance and use  and customer service and support 
to remain competitive  we believe we must invest significant resources in developing new products  enhancing our current products  expanding our channels and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to higher warranty costs associated with end user warranty returns as well as amortization expense related to certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the infrant acquisition 
operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in salary and other employee related expenses 
net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit of million  an increase in interest income of million and an increase in other income of  these increases were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of million and an increase in the provision for income taxes of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we have listed below our critical accounting policies which we believe to have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
currently  for some 
table of contents of our customers  title passes to the customer upon delivery to the port or country of destination  upon their receipt of the product  or upon the customer s resale of the product 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  we estimate and defer revenue related to product where title has not transferred 
the revenue continues to be deferred until such time that title passes to the customer 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period could be materially different if our management made different judgments and estimates 
allowances for product warranties  returns due to stock rotation  price protection  sales incentives and doubtful accounts our standard warranty obligation to our direct customers generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable or is found to be damaged or defective 
at the time revenue is recognized  an estimate of future warranty returns is recorded to reduce revenue in the amount of the expected credit or refund to be provided to the our direct customers 
at the time we record the reduction to revenue related to warranty returns  we include within cost of revenue a write down to reduce the carrying value of such products to net realizable value 
our standard warranty obligation to end users provides for repair or replacement of a defective product for one or more years 
factors that affect the warranty obligation include product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
the estimated cost associated with fulfilling the warranty obligation to end users is recorded in cost of revenue 
because our products are manufactured by third party manufacturers  in certain cases we have recourse to the third party manufacturer for replacement or credit for the defective products 
we give consideration to amounts recoverable from our third party manufacturers in determining our warranty liability 
our estimated allowances for product warranties can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions or charges to cost of revenue which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to warranty related returns  certain distributors and retailers generally have the right to return product for stock rotation purposes 
every quarter  stock rotation rights are generally limited to of invoiced sales to the distributor or retailer in the prior quarter 
upon shipment of the product  we reduce revenue for an estimate of potential future stock rotation returns related to the current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  channel inventory levels  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  namely stock rotation returns 
our estimated allowances for returns due to stock rotation can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
sales incentives provided to customers are accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products 
under these guidelines  we accrue for sales incentives as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction of revenues 
our estimated provisions for sales incentives can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional expenses or additional revenue reductions dependent on the classification of the sales incentive 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and adjusted if necessary based on our assessments of our customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers should deteriorate or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  additional allowances may be required  which could have an adverse impact on operating expenses 

table of contents valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we continually assess the value of our inventory and will periodically write down its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and on order under non cancelable purchase commitments  including consignment inventory  in comparison to our estimated forecast of product demand for the next nine months to determine what inventory  if any  are not saleable 
our analysis is based on the demand forecast but takes into account market conditions  product development plans  product life expectancy and other factors 
based on this analysis  we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess and obsolescence charges 
at the point of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
as demonstrated during prior years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand and we fail to reduce our manufacturing accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative effect on our gross profit 
goodwill and intangibles we apply sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and perform an annual goodwill impairment test 
for purposes of impairment testing  we have determined that the company has only one reporting unit 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of the company 
the estimates of fair value of the company are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily includes our market capitalization 
we did not recognize impairment charges in any of the periods presented 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from two to four years 
purchased intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
such conditions may include an economic downturn or a change in the assessment of future operations 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the carrying value of the asset is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts  both internal and external  that may suggest impairment 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from different treatments for tax versus accounting of certain items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets are recoverable  however  if there were a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would be required to take a charge in the period in which we determined that recovery was not more likely than not 
we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain income tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement sfas 
table of contents no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it provides that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken 
income tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of adoption  we recorded a reduction in tax liability of  and a corresponding increase in retained earnings as of january  we include interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional tax expense

and net changes in deferred revenue 
net revenue compared to net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we continued to experience our seasonal pattern of higher net revenues in the second half of the year 
the increase in revenue was attributable to higher sales in several of our product categories 
these include dsl gateway and cable gateway products sold to new and existing service provider customers and stronger worldwide switch sales  the launch of our readynas products  which were acquired in connection with our acquisition of infrant  and a full year of wireless n routers sales 
sales incentives that are classified as contra revenue grew at a slower rate than overall gross sales  which further contributed to the increased net revenue 
this favorable net revenue impact was partially offset by an increase in sales returns compared to historical return rates 
for the year ended december  revenue generated in the united states  emea and asia pacific and rest of world was  and  respectively 
the comparable net revenue for the year ended december  was  and  respectively 
the increase in net revenue over the prior year for each region was  and  respectively 

table of contents net revenue compared to net revenue net revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  we continued to experience our seasonal pattern of higher net revenues in the second half of the increase in revenue was especially attributable to higher sales of dsl gateway and powerline products to new and existing service provider customers  especially in europe 
the majority of these incremental sales specifically included our wireless gateway customized for major service provider british sky broadcasting in the united kingdom  with shipments of wireless gateways and powerline products to other service providers further improving revenue 
sales were further enhanced by the first full year of rangemax wireless router sales to the home market 
we introduced our rangemax family of products  which included performance enhancing multiple in multiple out mimo technology  during  and the market continued to embrace this key product line throughout sales incentives that are classified as contra revenue grew at a slower rate than overall gross sales  which further contributed to the increased net revenue 
this is primarily due to increased sales to the service provider markets  which typically require less marketing spending 
this favorable net revenue impact was partially offset by an increase in sales returns compared to historical return rates 
for the year ended december  revenue generated in the united states  emea and asia pacific and rest of world was  and  respectively

cost of revenue and gross margin year ended december  percentage change percentage change in thousands  except percentage data cost of revenue gross margin percentage cost of revenue consists primarily of the following the cost of finished products from our third party manufacturers  overhead costs including purchasing  product planning  inventory control  warehousing and distribution logistics  inbound freight  warranty costs associated with returned goods  write downs for excess and obsolete inventory  and amortization expense of certain acquired intangibles 
we outsource our manufacturing  warehousing and distribution logistics 
we believe this outsourcing strategy allows us to better manage our product costs and gross margin 
our gross margin can be affected by a number of factors  including sales returns  changes in net revenues due to changes in average selling prices  end user customer rebates and other sales incentives  and changes in our cost of goods sold due to fluctuations in prices paid for components  net of vendor rebates  warranty and overhead costs  inbound freight  conversion costs  and charges for excess or obsolete inventory 
cost of revenue and gross margin compared to cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our gross margin decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to higher warranty costs associated with end user warranty returns as well as amortization expense related to certain intangible assets acquired in connection with the infrant acquisition 
we amortized an additional million in intangibles related to our 
table of contents recent acquisitions in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  we also sold through the entire million in inventory acquired from infrant  which was recorded at fair value under purchase accounting guidelines 
of this million  million represented a charge for the step up to fair value in connection with the acquisition purchase accounting 
we also experienced increased sales of products carrying lower gross margins to service providers 
these negative margin impacts were partially mitigated by certain gross margin improvements 
our gross margin was impacted by our sales incentives that are recorded as a reduction in revenue which grew at a relatively slower rate than overall net revenue 
we experienced decreased price protection claims  as well as relatively lower inbound freight during the year  as we were able to continue to shift the mix of inbound shipments from our suppliers from more costly air freight to lower cost sea freight due to better supply chain planning 
additionally  stock based compensation expense increased  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  cost of revenue and gross margin compared to cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  our gross margin improved to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  our gross margin was impacted by our sales incentives that are recorded as a reduction in revenue which grew at a relatively slower rate than overall net revenue  as most of our revenue increases relate to sales to service providers  which involve significantly lower sales incentive expenses 
additionally  we experienced decreased price protection claims  as well as relatively lower inbound freight during  as we were able to shift the mix of inbound shipments from our suppliers from more costly air freight to lower cost sea freight due to better supply chain planning 
furthermore  rebates from vendors were significantly higher in these improvements were almost entirely offset by a number of factors 
incremental sales in came primarily from increased sales of products carrying lower gross margins to service providers 
we also experienced increased warranty and sales returns costs  driven primarily by a higher scrap rate of warranty return units and an increase in reserves taken for future returns based on the increase in returns volume during we also experienced higher costs related to inventory reserves and devaluation

however  we cannot be certain that our planned levels of revenue  costs and expenses will be achieved 
if our operating results fail to meet our expectations or if we fail to manage our inventory  accounts receivable or other assets  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in addition  as we continue to expand our product offerings  channels and geographic presence  we may require additional working capital 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable or commercially acceptable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and which are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment 
while we expect to fulfill the order backlog within the current year  most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with little or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in product scheduling or order cancellation  our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of net sales for any succeeding period 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle non cancelable lease and purchase commitments as of december  less than year years years more than years total in thousands operating leases purchase obligations we lease office space  cars and equipment under non cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through december rent expense was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  in september  we entered into a lease for a new corporate headquarters facility that occupies approximately  square feet in san jose  california  under a lease that commences in april and expires in march the terms of some of the office leases provide for rental payments on a graduated scale 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period  and have accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 
we enter into various inventory related purchase agreements with suppliers 
generally  under these agreements  of the orders are cancelable by giving notice to days prior to the expected shipment date and of orders are cancelable by giving notice days prior to the expected shipment date 
orders are not cancelable within days prior to the expected shipment date 
at december   we had million in non cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers 
we expect to sell all products for which we have committed purchases from suppliers 

table of contents we adopted fin on january  as of december   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest 
the timing of any payments which could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend upon a number of factors 
accordingly  the timing of payment cannot be estimated 
we do not expect a significant tax payment related to these obligations to occur within the next months 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for recent accounting pronouncements which are hereby incorporated by reference into this part ii  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in short term securities 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
we monitor our interest rate and credit risks  including our credit exposure to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
there were no impairment charges on our investments in fixed income securities during fiscal we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international manufacturing and sales activities 
we generally have not hedged currency exposures 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
in the second quarter of we began to invoice some of our international customers in foreign currencies including  but not limited to  the euro  great britain pound  japanese yen and the australian dollar 
as the customers that are currently invoiced in local currency become a larger percentage of our business  or to the extent we begin to bill additional customers in foreign currencies  the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a more significant impact on our results of operations 
for those customers in our international markets that we continue to sell to in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand could reduce sales and negatively impact our operating results 
certain operating expenses of our foreign operations require payment in the local currencies 
as of december   we had net assets in various local currencies 
a hypothetical movement in foreign exchange rates would result in an after tax positive or negative impact of million to net income at december  for the year ended december   of total net revenue was earned in currency other than us dollars
