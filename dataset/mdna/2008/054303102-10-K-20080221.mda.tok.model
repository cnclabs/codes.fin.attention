when used in this discussion  the terms avon  company  we or us mean  unless the context otherwise indicates  avon products  inc and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries 
overview we are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products 
our business is conducted worldwide  primarily in the direct selling channel 
we presently have sales operations in approximately countries and territories  including the us  and distribute products in approximately more 
our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in six regions north america  latin america  western europe  middle east africa  central eastern europe  asia pacific  and china 
we centrally manage global brand marketing and supply chain organizations 
product categories consist of beauty  which consists of cosmetics  fragrances  skin care and toiletries  beauty plus  which consists of fashion jewelry  watches  apparel and accessories  and beyond beauty  which consists of home products and gift and decorative products 
sales from health and wellness products and mark  a global cosmetics brand that focuses on the market for young women  are included among these categories based on product type 
sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through approximately million independent representatives  who are independent contractors and not employees of avon 
the success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting  motivating and retaining representatives 
we view the geographic diversity of our businesses as a strategic advantage 
in developed markets  such as the us  we seek to achieve growth in line with that of the overall beauty market  while in developing and emerging markets we seek to achieve higher growth targets 
revenue grew in every segment during we continued to experience strong growth in emerging and developing markets  including brazil  china  colombia  russia  turkey and venezuela 
we have also experienced growth in developed markets  such as the us and the us revenue in china increased significantly due to the continued roll out of direct selling 
see the segment review section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment 
in  we launched a comprehensive multi year turnaround plan  described below  which seeks to take costs out of our business and reinvest those savings in initiatives that we expect to generate revenues as well as increase profitability over the long run 
as part of this turnaround plan  we invested ahead of savings and incurred incremental costs  including investments in advertising and the representative value proposition rvp  as well as costs to implement restructuring and costs related to our product line simplification pls program 
operating margins for the years and were negatively impacted by these costs associated with our turnaround plan 
strategic initiatives in november  we launched a comprehensive  multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth 
our four point turnaround plan includes committing to brand competitiveness by focusing research and development resources on product innovation and by increasing our advertising  winning with commercial edge by more effectively utilizing pricing and promotion  expanding our sales leadership program and improving the attractiveness of our representative earnings opportunity as needed  elevating organizational effectiveness by redesigning our structure to eliminate layers of management in order to take full advantage of our global scale and size  and transforming the cost structure so that our costs are aligned to our revenue growth and remain so 
our turnaround plan has continued to gain traction and deliver results 
during  revenues increased  active representatives increased  with increases in all segments  and sales from each of our product categories increased  with products in the beauty category increasing  fueled by higher investments in advertising and rvp and benefiting from a shift in research and development investment to innovation 
beauty sales have also benefited from a modest improvement in both the frequency and depth of discounting 
the advertising and rvp investments were substantially funded by savings from restructuring initiatives and other cost savings initiatives 

table of contents in our ongoing effort to improve brand competitiveness  we increased our investment in advertising by in and in advertising investments were  and during  and  respectively 
approximately of the incremental spending was allocated to china  brazil  russia and the us the advertising investments supported new product launches  such as anew ultimate age repair night cream and elixir  christian lacroix fragrances  imari seduction and avon color cosmetics  including uplifting mascara  and ultra color rich lipstick  as well as support for hello tomorrow  avon s first global  integrated marketing campaign  supporting both the brand and direct selling channel 
advertising investments also included advertising to recruit representatives 
representative value proposition as part of the rvp  we also continued to invest in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our representatives 
we have allocated significant investments in proprietary direct selling analytics to better understand the drivers of value for our representatives 
we measure our investment in rvp as the incremental cost to provide these value enhancing initiatives 
in  we invested approximately incrementally to enhance rvp through continued implementation of our sales leadership program  increased incentives spending  web enablement  improved commissions  and the launch of more frequent selling opportunities in central and eastern europe 
investing in rvp will continue to be a key strategy 
product line simplification during  we began to analyze our product line  under our pls program  to develop a smaller range of better performing  more profitable products 
the overall goal of pls is to identify an improved product assortment to drive higher sales of more profitable products 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the analysis of our product portfolio  concluded on the appropriate product assortment going forward and made decisions regarding the ultimate disposition of products that will no longer be part of our improved product assortment such as selling at a discount  donation  or destruction 
as a result of these decisions  we recorded costs during the fourth quarter of of related to our pls program  which includes incremental inventory obsolescence expense of we incurred costs of related to our pls program for full year  which includes incremental inventory obsolescence expense of we have incurred total pls costs of in and in 
there will be no further pls inventory charges 
see the provisions for inventory obsolescence section of md a on page of the annual report on form k 
we expect that sales and marketing benefits will account for approximately of our projected benefits 
improving our product assortment will allow us to increase exposure and improve presentation of the remaining products within our brochure  which is expected to yield more pleasurable consumer shopping experiences  easier representative selling experiences  and greater sales per brochure page 
a second source of benefits from pls results from transferable demand 
transferable demand refers to the concept that when products with redundant characteristics are removed from our product assortment  some demand from the eliminated products will transfer to the remaining products that offer similar or comparable product characteristics 
as part of pls  when we identify products that have sufficient overlap of characteristics  we will eliminate the products with the lowest profitability and we expect the products that we retain will generate more profit 
a third source of benefits from pls is less price discounting 
as we implement operating procedures under pls  we anticipate introducing fewer new products and lengthening the lifecycle of products in our offering  which we expect will lead to less aggressive price discounting over a product s life cycle 
in addition to the benefits above  we also expect supply chain benefits to account for approximately of our projected benefits 
we expect improvements to cost of sales once pls is fully implemented  primarily from a reduction in inventory obsolescence expense as a result of better managed inventory levels  lower variable spending on warehousing  more efficient manufacturing utilization and lower purchasing costs 
we also expect operating expenses to benefit from a reduction in distribution costs and benefits to inventory productivity 
we expect to realize annualized benefits in excess of by the end of  with a full year of benefit in we expect to begin to realize initial benefits in the second half of  but the benefits in are not expected to be large 
annualized benefits  or annualized savings  mean the additional operating profit we expect to realize on a full year basis every year following full implementation of the respective initiative as compared with the operating profit we would have expected to achieve without having implemented the initiative 
we expect to realize benefits of approximately and in and  respectively  and in excess of in strategic sourcing initiative in march  we launched ssi 
this initiative is expected to reduce direct and indirect costs of materials  goods and services 
under this initiative  we are shifting our purchasing strategy from a local  commodity oriented approach towards a globally coordinated effort which leverages our volumes  allows our suppliers to benefit from economies of scale  utilizes sourcing best practices and processes  and better matches our suppliers capabilities with our needs 
beyond lower costs  our goals from ssi include improving asset management  service for representatives and vendor relationships 
during  we completed an analysis  based on data  which identified approximately  of spending to be targeted for cost reductions 
additionally  during  we implemented the first of three waves of this initiative  which has addressed approximately of the identified spending and is expected to generate approximately of the expected benefits 
during the fourth quarter of  we launched the second wave of this initiative  which is expected to address of the identified spending and generate approximately of the expected benefits 
we realized benefits of approximately from ssi during we expect to realize approximately of total expected benefits by  with annualized benefits from this initiative in excess of by the end of  with a full year of benefit in as a result  we expect to realize benefits of approximately and in and  respectively  and in excess of in 
table of contents we have also begun implementation of a sales and operating planning process that is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues 
zero overhead growth we have institutionalized a zero overhead growth philosophy that aims to offset inflation through productivity improvements 
these improvements in productivity will come primarily from ssi and our restructuring initiatives 
we have defined overhead as fixed expenses such as costs associated with our sales and marketing infrastructure  and management and administrative activities 
overhead excludes variable expenses within selling  general and administrative expenses  such as shipping and handling costs and bonuses to our employees in the sales organization  and also excludes consumer and strategic investments that are included in selling  general and administrative expenses  such as advertising  rvp  research and development and brochure costs 
while overhead expenses increased slightly during  the increase was due to the negative impact of foreign exchange 
restructuring initiatives in connection with our four point turnaround plan  in november  we announced a multi year restructuring plan  under which we expected to incur total restructuring charges and other costs to implement our restructuring initiatives in the range of before taxes 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced the final initiatives that are part of our restructuring plan 
we now expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement our restructuring initiatives of approximately before taxes 
we have recorded total costs to implement  net of adjustments  of in  in and in for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the plan  primarily for employee related costs  including severance  pension and other termination benefits  and professional service fees related to these initiatives 
we expect to record a majority of the remaining costs by the end of  approximately and in and  respectively 
we expect our restructuring initiatives to deliver annualized savings of approximately once all initiatives are fully implemented by  compared to our original estimate of in excess of we expect the savings to reach approximately by the actions implemented to date resulted in savings of approximately in  most of which were associated with the delayering program that we completed in  as compared to savings of approximately in the costs to implement restructuring initiatives during through are associated with specific actions  including organization realignment and downsizing in each region and global through a process called delayering  taking out layers to bring senior management closer to operations  the phased outsourcing of certain services  including certain finance  information technology  human resource and customer service processes  and the move of certain services from markets to lower cost shared service centers  the restructure of certain international direct selling operations  the realignment of certain distribution and manufacturing operations  including the realignment of certain of our north america and latin america distribution operations  the automation of certain distribution processes  the exit of certain unprofitable operations  including the closure of the avon salon spa  the closure of our operations in indonesia  the exit of a product line in china and the exit of the becoming product line in the us  and the reorganization of certain functions  primarily sales related organizations 
see note  restructuring initiatives  on pages f through f of this annual report on form k 
outlook we expect that our investments in both the brand and the direct selling channel will drive sustainable growth 
we expect revenue growth to average mid single digits over the long term 
while our operating margin during and has been impacted by the costs associated with our turnaround plan  we expect our operating margin to be impacted to a much lesser degree in by these costs 
we expect our incremental investments in advertising in to be more in line with revenue growth and incremental investments in rvp to be slightly ahead of revenue growth 
while full year operating margin improved slightly in to from s level of  it is expected to approach s level  or approximately  in  due to the projected benefits from and decreased cost related to pls  other gross margin improvements  projected benefits from 
table of contents ssi  and projected savings from and decreased costs to implement restructuring 
we expect a larger proportion of the benefits from pls and ssi and savings from restructuring to be realized in the second half of the year 
as revenues grow and the savings from restructuring and benefits from pls and ssi are realized  and we continue to apply a zero overhead growth philosophy  operating margin is expected to further expand beginning in we saw a decelerating trend in our north american segment revenue in the fourth quarter of  consistent with the general retail environment 
this decelerating trend continued into the first quarter of the revenue trend in our north america segment has been heavily influenced by weakness in our non beauty business 
our broad based geographic portfolio gives us confidence that we can weather macroeconomic pressures and achieve our company wide revenue and operating margin targets for full year as described above  in january  we announced the final initiatives of the restructuring program under our turnaround plan 
we also announced that we have completed our analysis of our optimal product portfolio and made decisions on exit strategies for non optimal products under our pls program 
as we continue to move through our turnaround plan  driving revenue growth and restoring margin growth are our key priorities  with an emphasis on ssi and our philosophy of zero overhead growth 
however  since our turnaround plan is a multi year effort  we still may see some quarterly variability as we move through the turnaround due to the timing of advertising and product launches

key performance indicators within the following discussion and analysis  we utilize the key performance indicators kpis defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business 
kpi definition growth in active representatives this indicator is based on the number of representatives submitting an order in a campaign  totaled for all campaigns in the related period 
this amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period  to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days for example  holiday schedules 
to determine the growth in active representatives  this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year 
change in units this indicator is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period  as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year 
units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product for example  gift with purchase or purchase with purchase  but exclude free samples 
inventory days this indicator is equal to the number of days of historical cost of sales covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period 
critical accounting estimates we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
see note  description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies  for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
restructuring reserves we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of fas no 
 employer s accounting for post employment benefits for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time  involuntary benefit arrangements and disposal costs  primarily contract termination costs  are accounted for under the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
one time  voluntary benefit arrangements are accounted for under the provisions of fas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
we evaluate impairment issues under the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we estimate the expense for these initiatives  when approved by the appropriate corporate authority  by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans 
these expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases  and any other qualifying exit costs 
these estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel 
such costs represent management s best estimate  but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time  including attrition rates 
estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if and adjustment is required 

table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts receivable representatives contact their customers  selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign 
sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the us and a two to four week duration outside the us the representative purchases products directly from avon and may or may not sell them to an end user 
in general  the representative  an independent contractor  remits a payment to avon each sales campaign  which relates to the prior campaign cycle 
the representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid  however  there are circumstances where the representative fails to make the required payment 
we record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances 
over the past three years  annual bad debt expense has been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
we generally have no detailed information concerning  or any communication with  any end user of our products beyond the representative 
we have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectability of any accounts receivable balances due from the representative to us 
if the financial condition of our representatives were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowances for sales returns we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
over the past three years  sales returns have been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns  due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies  or for other reasons  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence  we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle  future marketing sales plans and the disposition process 
we assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision 
if actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence 
annual obsolescence expense was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as discussed in the overview section  and include inventory obsolescence charges of and  respectively  related to our pls program and also includes related to our decision to discontinue the sale of heavily discounted excess products 
pension  postretirement and postemployment benefit expense we maintain defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all employees in the us and in certain international locations 
additionally  we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for certain current and retired executives see note  employee benefit plans 
our calculations of pension  postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent upon the use of assumptions  including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  interest cost  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  mortality rates  the number of associate retirements  the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors 
actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   we had pretax actuarial losses of and for the us and us plans  respectively  that have not yet been charged to expense 
these actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within equity in accordance with sfas  which was adopted december  while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension  postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense 
for  the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets  including the us and us plans was 
in determining the long term rates of return  we consider the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies  historical rates of return and current economic forecasts 
we evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary 
the majority of our pension plan assets relate to the us pension plan 
the assumed rate of return for for the us plan was  which was based on an asset allocation of approximately in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term and in equity securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term 
historical rates of return on the assets of the us plan for the most recent year and year periods were and  respectively 
in the us plan  our asset allocation policy has favored us equity securities  which have returned and  respectively  over the year and year periods 
the actual rate of return on plan assets in the us was and in and  respectively 

table of contents the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency 
the discount rates for our more significant plans  including our us plan  were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan 
the weighted average discount rate for us and us plans determined on this basis was at december   and at december  future effects of pension plans on our operating results will depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates  the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments  investment performance and funding decisions  among other factors 
however  given current assumptions including those noted above  pension expense related to the us plan is expected to decrease in the range of to a basis point change in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases  would have had the following effect on pension expense increase decrease in pension expense basis point increase basis point decrease rate of return on assets discount rate rate of compensation increase taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future  in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made 
deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us when management concludes that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested 
deferred taxes are provided on earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
we file income tax returns in many jurisdictions 
in  a number of income tax returns are scheduled to close by statute and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed 
if avon s filing positions are ultimately upheld  it is possible that the provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments 
depending on the number of filing positions ultimately upheld  the impact of the adjustments could be significant to net income 
in accordance with fin  we recognize the benefit of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options 
this model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

table of contents loss contingencies in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements

total revenue increased in  primarily due to growth in active representatives  benefiting from continued investments in rvp and recruiting advertising 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to see decelerating trends in non beauty  particularly in accessories and apparel  driven by the negative impact of rising gas prices  as well as softness in the us retail sector  which negatively impacted average order 
this decelerating trend continued into the first quarter of the us business is in the midst of a long term turnaround plan  therefore  we expect variability in our quarterly performance of north america 
quarterly performance has been and may continue to be impacted by various factors  including the impact of fuel prices and the general us economy on representatives ordering activity and timing of product launches 
the increase in operating margin for was primarily driven by lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives  which positively impacted operating margin by points  savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives and supply chain efficiencies 
these benefits to operating margin were partially offset by higher inventory obsolescence expense  higher spending on advertising and rvp  and costs related to the implementation of an enterprise resource planning system 
north america compared to point change us local currency total revenue operating profit operating margin units sold active representatives total revenue increased in  as the larger average order received from representatives more than offset a decline in active representatives 
revenue in benefited from new product launches  supported by significant advertising 
the increase in average order was driven by strong sales of products in the beauty plus category  which has a higher price point 
the primary contributor to the decline in active representatives was a decrease in the number of orders placed 
while active representatives declined overall for  we noted an improvement in the second half of the year  turning to slight growth in the fourth quarter 
we believe this improvement was primarily driven by a variety of representative value enhancing initiatives we implemented during the second half of in our us business designed to increase representative ordering activity  combined with our increased consumer investments and some easing in the negative impact from higher fuel prices 
in the us  these representative value enhancing initiatives included re indexing of certain earnings thresholds in our sales leadership program  distributing bonus brochures to higher performing representatives and strengthening sales incentives 
the decrease in operating margin in north america was primarily driven by incremental costs to implement restructuring initiatives  including costs associated with our decision to realign north america distribution operations  delayering and the closure of the avon salon spa 
these incremental costs negatively impacted operating margin by points 
the decrease in operating margin was also due to substantially higher spending on

revenue in mexico was flat in  as a mid single digit increase in active representatives was offset by a lower average order 
the increase in active representatives in mexico primarily reflects strengthened training and incentives and the retraining of our zone managers in field fundamentals 
the lower average order was mainly due to product mix and a higher share of sales from new representatives 
while we have seen improving field trends in our business in mexico during  this business is in the midst of a long term turnaround plan and we expect some variability in our quarterly performance 
the decrease in operating margin for was primarily driven by higher spending on advertising and rvp and an unfavorable mix of products sold 
these higher costs were partially offset by the impact of higher revenue  lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives  which positively impacted operating margin by 
point  savings associated with position eliminations resulting from restructuring initiatives  and the recognition of unclaimed sales related tax credits 
currency restrictions enacted by the venezuelan government in have impacted the ability of our subsidiary in venezuela avon venezuela to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products

the increase in revenue in brazil and the acquisition and growth of colombia more than compensated for continued declines in mexico  where revenues decreased  mainly due to a decline in active representatives

the increase in operating margin for was primarily driven by lower costs to implement restructuring initiatives  which positively impacted operating margin by points

at the same time that we have been building on direct selling  we have seen ordering activity levels maintained by our beauty boutiques as they continue to engage in direct selling by servicing our representatives 
additionally  the number of beauty boutiques has remained stable over the last year 
revenue in benefited from representative recruiting and continued significant investments in advertising 
the increase in operating margin for was primarily driven by the impact of higher revenue and a reduction of a reserve for statutory liabilities

table of contents china compared to point change us local currency total revenue operating profit operating margin units sold active representatives calculation not meaningful our business in china continued to evolve with the opening of direct selling 
in late february  avon received the first national license to commence direct selling under directives issued by the chinese government in late since then  we have been actively recruiting a direct selling force  called sales promoters  throughout the country 
these sales promoters must be trained and certified according to government regulations 
as of december   we had over  certified sales promoters  approximately  of whom fit our standard definition of active representatives 
we have been and continue to be engaged in comprehensive training of these sales promoters to help them build their business by developing their customer base and product knowledge 
prior to the reopening of direct selling we had sold our products in china through a network of licensed beauty boutiques  as well as dealer owned and company owned store counters 
the company owned store counters were exited as part of our restructuring initiatives 
in addition to being a retail boutique  a beauty boutique can now participate in direct selling by operating as a service center to the sales promoters  an essential element of the direct selling model stipulated in the direct selling regulations  for which they can earn service fees from avon 
china s revenue is now generated through sales promoters  beauty boutiques and dealer owned counters 
total revenue increased in  as significant growth in direct selling more than offset the lower revenue from beauty boutiques  as they reduced their order sizes in connection with the resumption of direct selling  as well as the unfavorable impact of the exit of company owned counters  which had a negative nine point impact on revenue growth 
total revenue in also benefited from the favorable effects of foreign exchange 
due to the significant growth of direct selling since our march launch  during  direct selling became a greater portion of our business and is expected to continue as it is built up 
at the same time that we have been building on direct selling  we have stabilized our beauty boutiques 
during  we did not experience a significant decline in the number of beauty boutiques  and we ended with a similar number of active beauty boutiques as compared to the beginning of the operating margin decrease was primarily driven by significantly higher spending on advertising  fees paid to registered service centers for providing services to our active representatives  and other costs associated with the launch of direct selling

additionally  as disclosed in note  restructuring initiatives  we have a remaining liability of at december   associated with the restructuring charges recorded to date  and we also expect to record additional restructuring charges of in future periods to implement the actions approved to date 
the significant majority of these liabilities will require cash payments during off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no material off balance sheet arrangements 
capital resources total debt at december  increased to  from  at december   primarily due to higher commercial paper borrowings 
we have a five year   revolving credit and competitive advance facility the credit facility  which expires in january the credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes 
the interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility is based on libor or on the higher of prime or plus the federal funds rate 
the credit facility has an annual fee of  payable quarterly  based on our current credit ratings 
the credit facility contains various covenants  including a financial covenant which requires avon s interest coverage ratio determined in relation to our consolidated pretax income and interest expense to equal or exceed the credit facility also provides for a possible extension of the term by up to two years and possible increases by up to an aggregate incremental principal amount of  subject to the consent of the affected lenders under the credit facility

the commercial paper short term notes issued under the program are not redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to voluntary prepayment 
the commercial paper

in august  we entered into an amendment of our one year japanese yen billion at the exchange rate on december  uncommitted credit facility with the bank of tokyo mitsubishi ufj  ltd 
the amendment provides for the extension of the yen credit facility until august at december   japanese yen billion was outstanding under the yen credit facility

such indentures do not contain any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of our debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means 
since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and forecasted transactions  we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives 
the master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in certain circumstances  including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of avon prior to the merger 
interest rate risk our long term  fixed rate borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
we use interest rate swaps  which effectively convert the fixed rate on the debt to a floating interest rate  to manage our interest rate exposure 
at december  and  we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately of our outstanding long term  fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on libor 
avon s total exposure to floating interest rates at december  and december  was approximately and  respectively 
our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at december   a hypothetical basis point change either an increase or a decrease in interest rates prevailing at that date  sustained for one year  would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt 
in august  we entered into locks with notional amounts totaling that expired on january  the locks have been designated as cash flow hedges and are being used to hedge exposure to a possible rise in interest rates  as we expect to incur long term debt to refinance our commercial paper 
at december   we recorded unrealized losses of in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the locks 
on january   we extended the maturity date of the locks to july   as we expect to incur long term debt by this date 
changes 
table of contents in interest rates will affect the fair value of these locks 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximately decrease in unrealized losses and a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximately increase in unrealized losses 
foreign currency risk we operate globally  with operations in various locations around the world 
over the past three years  approximately to of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the us the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency 
we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations  primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities 
at december   the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the argentine peso  brazilian real  british pound  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  colombian peso  the euro  japanese yen  mexican peso  polish zloty  russian ruble  turkish lira and venezuelan bolivar 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to  and  therefore  cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
based on our foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 
the hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at december   adjusted for an assumed appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against these hedging contracts 
credit risk of financial instruments we attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements only with major international financial institutions with a or higher credit ratings as issued by standard poor s corporation 
our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts  swaps or options with major international financial institutions 
although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments  we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses  if any  would not be material 
non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a write off of at december  in addition  in the event of non performance by such counterparties  we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates
