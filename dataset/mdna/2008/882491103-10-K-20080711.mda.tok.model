item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading supplier of heavy construction materials in the united states through our three business segments cement  aggregates and consumer products 
our principal products are gray portland cement  produced and sold through our cement segment  stone  sand and gravel  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and ready mix concrete  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
other products include expanded shale and clay aggregates  produced and sold through our aggregates segment  and packaged concrete and related products  produced and sold through our consumer products segment 
our facilities are concentrated primarily in texas  louisiana and california 
in may  we completed construction on a project to expand and modernize our oro grande  california cement plant at a total project cost of approximately million  excluding capitalized interest related to the project 
we constructed approximately million tons of advanced dry process annual cement production capacity  and retired the million tons of existing  but less efficient  production 
in october  we commenced construction on a project to expand our hunter  texas cement plant 
we are expanding the hunter plant by approximately million tons of advanced dry process annual cement production capacity

the effective rate for discontinued operations was in the american jobs creation act of  among other things  allows a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities  which will be phased in from through we realized a benefit of million in and million in but did not realize a benefit in because of a taxable loss for the year 

table of contents effective june   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we have no significant reserves for uncertain tax positions and no adjustments to such reserves were required upon adoption of this interpretation 
interest and penalties resulting from audits by tax authorities have been immaterial and are included in income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition to our federal income tax return  we file income tax returns in various state jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to federal or state income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to our federal income tax returns for through are currently under examination 
we anticipate that the examination will be completed in fiscal year  and that any adjustments that may result from this examination would not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
income from discontinued operations net of income taxes as a result of the spin off of chaparral  the operating results of our steel segment  including the allocation of certain corporate expenses  have been presented as discontinued operations 
fiscal year includes steel operations through the july  spin off date 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more complex judgments and estimates 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if we are aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and make provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
legal contingencies 
we are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business  and make provision for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
goodwill 
management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
in applying a fair value based test  estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the applicable reporting unit 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 

table of contents recent accounting developments in march  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard applies to derivative instruments  nonderivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments and related hedged items accounted for under sfas no

in addition  we purchase mining services for use at our north texas cement plant 
we expect to utilize these materials and services in the normal course of business operations

table of contents cash flows net cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively

other items environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and permits concerning  among other matters  air emissions and wastewater discharge 
we intend to comply with these laws  regulations and permits 
however  from time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we are or may be in violation of certain of these laws  regulations and permits  or from private parties alleging that our operations have injured them or their property 
see legal proceedings in item  business  for a description of certain claims 
it is possible that we could be held liable for future charges which might be material but are not currently known or estimable 
in addition  changes in federal or state laws  regulations or requirements or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by us 
market risk historically  we have not entered into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
because of the short duration of our investments  changes in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on their fair value 
the fair value of fixed rate debt will vary as interest rates change 
the estimated fair value of each class of financial instrument as of may  approximates its carrying value except for long term debt having fixed interest rates 
at may   the fair value of long term debt having fixed interest rates  estimated based on broker dealer quoted market prices  is approximately million compared to the carrying amount of million 
with respect to borrowings under our million senior term loan and senior revolving credit facility  which are variable rate debt  a percent change in interest rates for the year ended may   would not have resulted in a significant annual change in our pretax earnings and cash flows 
our operations require large amounts of energy and are dependent upon energy sources  including electricity and fossil fuels 
prices for energy are subject to market forces largely beyond our control 
we have generally not entered into any long term contracts to satisfy our fuel and electricity needs  with the exception of coal which we purchase from specific mines pursuant to long term contracts 
however  we continually monitor these markets and we may decide in the future to enter into long term contracts 
if we are unable to meet our requirements for fuel and electricity  we may experience interruptions in our production 
price increases or disruption of the uninterrupted supply of these products could adversely affect our results of operations
