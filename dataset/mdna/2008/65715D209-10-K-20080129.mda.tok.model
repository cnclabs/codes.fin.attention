overview we manufacture  market and sell products for the radiation oncology community  including prospera brachytherapy seeds and surtrak needles and strands used primarily in the treatment of prostate cancer 
we also develop and market brachytherapy accessories used in the treatment of disease and calibration sources used in medical  environmental  research and industrial applications 
in november  we announced the introduction of clearpath  our unique multicatheter breast brachytherapy device for accelerated partial breast irradiation apbi 
our clearpath systems are placed through a single incision and are designed to conform to the resection cavity  allowing physicians to deliver a more conformal therapeutic radiation dose distribution following lumpectomy compared to other methods of apbi 
the placement of the radiation source directly into the post lumpectomy site reduces the treatment time to approximately days compared to days for whole breast radiation therapy  and reduces the risks associated with external beam radiation treatment 
clearpath is designed to accommodate either high dose  clearpath hdr  or low dose rate  clearpath cr  treatment methods 
we received k approval from the united states food and drug administration for a low dose rate  or continuous release treatment utilizing our prospera brachytherapy seeds in april and approval for the high dose rate treatment in november we have been gaining clinical experience with the first generation clearpath hdr in  and we intend to launch the second generation devices in  to be followed by the general commercial release of our clearpath cr 
on september   we completed the sale of all significant assets  including licenses  trademarks and brand names  and selected liabilities of nomos corporation to best medical  inc for  we expect that the divestiture of nomos will allow us to better utilize financial resources to benefit the marketing and development of innovative brachytherapy products for the treatment of cancer 
the financial results of nomos are reported as a discontinued operation in accompanying financial statements 
we have incurred substantial net losses since fiscal year we expect the losses to continue for at least the next fiscal year as we continue to develop our clearpath product  and obtaining adequate financing is an important part of our business strategy

note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and long lived asset impairments  loss contingencies  and taxes 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
use of estimates in the normal course of preparing the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market as determined under the first in  first out method 
costs include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
the company s radiation sources products are subject to shelf life expiration periods  which are carefully monitored by the company 
provision is made for inventory items which may not be sold because of expiring dates 
the company routinely reviews other inventories for evidence of impairment of value and makes provision as such impairments are identified 
fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  receivables  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of their short maturities 
the company determines the fair value of its marketable securities based on quoted market prices 
marketable securities the company invests excess cash in marketable securities consisting primarily of commercial paper  corporate notes and bonds  us government securities and money market funds 
investments with maturities of less than one year are considered to be short term and are classified as current assets 
debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and reported at amortized cost 
debt securities not classified as held to maturity and marketable equity securities are classified as either trading or available for sale  and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings or stockholders equity  respectively 
all other equity securities are accounted for using either the cost method or the equity method 
the company continually reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
the company determines the allowance based on historical write off experience and customer economic data

past due balances over days and over a specified amount are reviewed individually for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes that it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 
equipment and leasehold improvements equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred  while improvements are capitalized 
gains or losses resulting from the disposition of assets are included in income 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives as follows furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements lesser of the useful life or term of lease intangible assets license agreements are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging up to fifteen years 
the amortization periods of patents are based on the lives of the license agreements to which they are associated or the approximate remaining lives of the patents  whichever is shorter 
purchased intangible assets with finite lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to twelve years 
the company reviews for impairment whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset are less than the carrying value  a write down is recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated

liquidity and capital resources to date  our short term liquidity needs have generally consisted of working capital to fund our ongoing operations and to finance growth in inventories  trade accounts receivable  new product research and development  capital expenditures  acquisitions and strategic investments in related businesses 
we have satisfied these needs primarily through a combination of cash generated by operations  lines of credit  public offerings and from private placements of our common stock 
we expect that we will be able to satisfy our longer term liquidity needs for research and development  capital expenditures  and acquisitions through a combination of cash generated by operations  issuance of our common stock  debt  and our anticipated available line of credit 
the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended october   and  respectively  and have used cash in operations of million  million and million for the years ended october   and  respectively 
as of october   we had an accumulated deficit of million  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  and million of interest bearing debt 
based on the company s current operating plans  management believes that the company s existing cash resources and cash forecasted by management to be generated by operations  funds to be raised by the company through an equity financing  as well as the company s anticipated available lines of credit  will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
in this regard  we raised additional equity financing in the gross amount of million in the first quarter of fiscal to fund our continuing operations  support the further development of clearpath and other activities 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be successful with its plans 
if events and circumstances occur such that the company does not meet its current operating plans  the company is unable to raise sufficient additional equity or debt financing  or the company s line of credit which presently expires on february  are insufficient or not available  the company may be required to further reduce expenses or take other steps which could have a material adverse effect on our future performance  including but not limited to  the premature sale of some or all of our assets or product lines on undesirable terms  merger with or acquisition by another company on unsatisfactory terms  or the cessation of operations 
management also expects that in future periods new products and services will provide additional cash flow  although no assurance can be given that such cash flow will be realized  and we are presently placing an emphasis on controlling expenses 
the following sections discuss the effects of changes in our balance sheets  cash flows  and commitments on our liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheet and cash flows cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
at october   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities aggregating approximately million  a decrease of approximately million from million at october  the decrease was primarily attributed to cash used in continuing operations of million  and cash used in discontinued operations of million  partially offset by proceeds from lines of credit of million and proceeds from exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares related to our employee stock purchase plan of million 
we raised additional equity financing in the gross amount of million in the first quarter of fiscal  and received approximately million in cash  net of offering expenses 
we expect that cash used in operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  research and development expenses  and the timing of payments 
during the year ended october   we received million from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of shares related to our employee stock purchase plan 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the employee stock purchase plan will vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options 
the primary objectives for our investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made to achieve the highest rate of return  consistent with these two objectives 
we invest excess cash in securities with varying maturities to meet projected cash needs 
equipment and leasehold improvements 
equipment and leasehold improvements fixed assets decreased approximately million to million at october   from million at october  the decrease in fixed assets reflects capital expenditures of million offset by million in depreciation expense 
accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased approximately million to million as of october   from million at october   primarily due to a reduction in accrued expenses 
liquidity and capital resource requirements we have operating lease obligations for facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
future minimum lease payments are subject to annual adjustment for increases in the consumer price index 
we also have purchase commitments to suppliers under blanket purchase orders 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases license fees purchase commitments based on our current operating plans  we believe that the existing cash resources  cash forecasted by our plans to be generated by operations  and our anticipated available bank lines of credit will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors including our future operating results  levels of sales and marketing that will be required to launch future products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace for both existing and new products  market acceptance of our products  levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  competitors responses to our products  level of capital expenditures  and acquisition or development of other businesses  technologies or products 
if we should require additional financing due to continued operating losses or other unanticipated developments  additional financing may not be available when needed or  if available  we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  dilution to existing stockholders would result 
insufficient funds may require us to further reduce expenses or take other steps which could have a material adverse effect on our future performance  including but not limited to  the premature sale of some or all of our assets or product lines on undesirable terms  merger with or acquisition by another company on unsatisfactory terms  or the cessation of operations

it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet
