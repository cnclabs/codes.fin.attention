item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included beginning on page f of this form k 
the discussion in this form k contains both historical information and forward looking statements 
a number of factors affect our operating results and could cause our actual future results to differ materially from any forward looking results discussed below 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as anticipates  appears  believes  continue  could  estimates  expects  feels  goal  hope  intends  may  our future success depends  plans  potential  predicts  projects  reasonably  seek to continue  should  thinks  will or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
actual events or results may differ materially 
in addition  historical information should not be considered an indicator of future performance 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  the risks discussed in part i  item a of this form k under the caption risk factors 
these factors may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance  or achievements 
moreover  we are under no duty to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this form k to conform these statements to actual results 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of overview we develop  market and support innovative broadband access products designed to enable telecom service providers to offer bundled voice  video and data  or triple play  services over both copper and fiber optic networks 
our broadband loop carrier  or blc  is an integrated hardware and software platform that uses internet protocol  or ip  and ethernet technologies to increase the capacity of local access networks  enabling our customers to deliver advanced services  including voice over ip  or voip  ip based television  or iptv  and high definition television  or hdtv 
our platform simultaneously supports traditional voice services  enabling our customers to leverage their existing networks and migrate to ip without disruption 
in addition to providing our customers with increased bandwidth  our products provide incremental value by offering software based features to improve the quality  resiliency and security of triple play services 
we market our products through a combination of direct and indirect channels 
our direct sales efforts are focused on the independent operating company  or ioc  segment of the telecom service provider market 
we also target larger telecom service providers through strategic reseller relationships 
as of december   we had shipped our blc platform to over customers 
from our inception through december   we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million 
we realized income from operations and were profitable on a net income basis during the quarters ended september  and december  and for the year ended december  previously  we had not been profitable on a quarterly or annual basis  excluding the quarter ended december   in which we realized modest operating income of  we experienced operating and net losses in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal and for fiscal as a whole 
in the second and third quarters of  we experienced a softening in our business 
we believe this softening was attributable in part to delays associated with our customers evaluations of strategic investment decisions concerning their movement from copper wire to fiber  in part to a shift in our customer base toward longer term loan projects funded by the us department of agriculture s rural utilities service  or rus program  and delays in our financial reporting 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced an improvement in our business  with both revenues and gross margin increasing significantly from the third quarter 
in particular  we benefited from strong seasonal spending from our customer base  a new customer in guam  and an apparent increase in customer confidence  which we attribute in part to the completion of our restatement and our sec filings 
while we expect the transition from copper wire to fiber to continue  we believe that the pace and impact of this transition will vary from quarter to quarter 
our outlook for was improved by our recent selection by fairpoint communications  inc as the lead access equipment provider for a major broadband upgrade of fairpoint s network in northern new england 
this planned upgrade is subject to regulatory approval and completion of the proposed acquisition by fairpoint of verizon s wireline business in vermont  new hampshire and maine  completion of an upgrade schedule by fairpoint  changes in fairpoint s order patterns and purchase decisions and other factors 
we have not yet received any product orders from fairpoint and fairpoint is not obligated to place any such orders with us 
as discussed below under the caption restatement of consolidated financial statements  in october we restated our previously released consolidated financial statements for the following fiscal periods i the fiscal years ended december  and december   ii each of the interim quarterly periods in the fiscal years ended december  and december   and iii each of the interim quarterly periods ended march  june  and september  prior to january   when we adopted a calendar year end for fiscal reporting purposes  we prepared our financial statements with the end of each quarter falling on the last sunday of each calendar quarter 
as a result  our accounting quarters did not necessarily coincide with the last day of the calendar month 
effective january   we adopted a calendar fiscal year end 
the quarter end dates for fiscal were march  june  september  and december critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  litigation  warranty reserve and valuation of deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales revenue when persuasive evidence of sales arrangements exist  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
we allow credit for products returned within our policy terms 
in addition to the aforementioned general policy  we enter into transactions that represent multiple element arrangements  which may include training and post sales technical support and maintenance to our customers as needed to assist them in installation or use of our products  and make provisions for these costs in the periods of sale 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
a multiple element arrangement is separated into more than one unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria are not met  then sales are deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
in certain circumstances  we enter into arrangements with customers who receive financing support in the form of long term low interest rate loans from the united states department of agriculture s rural utilities service  or rus 
the terms of the rus contracts provide that in certain instances transfer of title of our products does not occur until customer acceptance 
in these cases  we do not recognize revenue until final payment has been received  provided the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
we believe payment  which contractually occurs after written customer acceptance  provides superior assurance for revenue recognition purposes 
in certain circumstances  we enter into transactions with value added resellers where the resellers may not have the ability to pay us for these sales independent of payment to them by the end user 
in these cases  we do not recognize revenue until payment has been received  provided the remaining revenue recognition criteria are met 
we further warrant our products for periods up to five years and record an estimated warranty accrual when shipment occurs 
valuation of inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of acquisition cost or market value  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand and market conditions and compare them with current inventory levels 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax asset to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
for  and  our net deferred tax assets have been offset with a full valuation allowance 
loss contingencies we evaluate our estimated potential financial exposure for loss contingencies  particularly the pending litigation matters discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  we accrue an estimated loss related to a contingency if a it is probable that a liability had been incurred and future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss at the date of the consolidated financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a reasonable estimate of the loss is a range and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  we accrue the minimum amount in the range 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimated potential liability could materially impact our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we have not recorded an accrual for an estimated loss for the ipo allocation case because we believe the anticipated settlement amounts are covered by our insurance policies 
product warranties we provide a standard warranty with the sale of our products for up to five years from the date of shipment 
the estimated cost of providing the product warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we maintain product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual history  projected return and failure rates and current repair costs 
our estimates are based on the actual number of products returned for repairs  an estimate of products that may be returned for warranty repair and estimated costs of repair depending on the type of service required 
these estimates require us to examine past warranty issues and consider their continuing impact in the future 
our accrual is based on consideration of all these factors which are known as of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
to the extent that actual warranty repairs are higher than our estimates  our costs will increase 
the liability for warranty returns totaled  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
stock based compensation effective beginning the first fiscal quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation costs for all awards granted after the date of adoption and the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding at the date of adoption are measured at estimated fair value and included in cost of sales and operating expenses over the vesting period during which an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
prior period amounts presented herein have not been restated to reflect the adoption of sfas no 
r 
upon adoption of sfas r  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the use of the black scholes model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  forfeitures  and expected dividends 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we do not anticipate declaring dividends in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on the annualized weekly historical volatility of our stock price and we believe it is indicative of future volatility 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on historical exercise and post vesting cancellation patterns with consideration to our industry peers of similar size with similar option vesting periods 
our analysis of stock price volatility and option lives involves management s best estimates at the time of determination 
sfas r also requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options or stock units that are expected to vest 
therefore  we apply an estimated forfeiture rate that is derived from historical employee termination behavior 
if the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
we recognize stock based compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units 
fair value is determined by using the closing price of our common stock on the grant date 
the fair value of these awards is recognized to expense over the requisite service period of the awards 
during  stock based compensation expense associated with restricted stock units totaled  restatement of consolidated financial statements on october   we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors had completed its previously announced internal review of our revenue recognition practices 
as a result of the review  we determined that our previously filed consolidated financial statements for the following periods required restatement i our fiscal years ended december  and december   ii each of the interim quarterly periods in our fiscal years ended december  and december   and iii each of the interim quarterly periods ended march  june  and september  the adjustments resulting from the restatement relate solely to revenue recognition matters 
the restatement adjustments did not affect our reported cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as of the end of any fiscal period 
specifically  we determined that a restatement was required because we incorrectly accounted for the following categories of transactions i transactions involving commitments to certain customers in connection with sales for features or deliverables that were not available at the time revenue was originally recognized  including commitments to prospectively provide free product  software  training  and installation services  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal  ii sales to value added resellers where the resellers did not have the ability to pay us for these sales independent of payment to them by the end user  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal  and iii for certain quarters ending on weekends  transactions involving our use of a shipping vendor who picked up product for subsequent delivery to another shipping company where the terms and conditions of the shipments did not appropriately transfer title or risk of loss at the time of shipment  for which we prematurely recognized approximately million in revenue from fiscal to fiscal in addition  we prematurely recognized approximately million of revenue from fiscal through fiscal relating principally to errors in accounting for software and software maintenance  customer credits  and undelivered free product 
in determining that a restatement was required  we accounted for hardware sales and related cost of sales in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  or sab we accounted for software sales in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  or sop we accounted for sales with multiple deliverables in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf results of operations fiscal years ended december   december  and december  sales fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated sales    see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in sales in over was mainly due to continued expansion of our customer base  repeat orders from existing customers and increased sales of new and existing blc products  related accessories and cabinets 
in  these factors were partially offset by a softening in our business in the second and third quarters of that we believe was attributable to adverse trends affecting our target customer markets  delays associated with our customers evaluations of strategic investment decisions concerning their movement from copper wire to fiber and uncertainty concerning our delayed financial reporting 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced an improvement in our business  with both revenues and gross margin increasing significantly from the third quarter 
in particular  we benefited from strong seasonal spending from our customer base  a new customer in guam and an apparent increase in customer confidence  which we attribute in part to the completion of our restatement and our sec filings 
while we expect the transition from copper wire to fiber to continue  we believe that the pace and impact of this transition will vary from quarter to quarter 
we expect revenues to grow at a moderate pace throughout sales increased by million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in sales in over was mainly due to an expansion of our customer base  repeat orders from existing customers and increased sales of blc products  related accessories and cabinets 
the growth in blc system sales  and our sales in general  followed the release of the blc system product line during the third quarter of in and  several enhancements and new features were introduced to the blc system  which resulted in greater market penetration and sales 
cost of sales and gross margin fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated cost of sales    gross margin    gross margin see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
cost of sales includes the cost of products shipped for which sales were recognized  warranty costs  costs of any manufacturing yield problems  field replacements  rework costs  manufacturing overhead  provisions for obsolete inventory and the cost of post sale support 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million in compared to this increase in cost of sales in was primarily due to an increase in revenues 
our gross margin was stable at as compared to in cost of sales increased by million  or  to million in compared to this increase in cost of sales in was primarily due to an increase in revenues 
our gross margin increased from in to in the improvement in our gross margin from fiscal to was primarily due to reductions in product manufacturing costs and inventory carrying costs  partially offset by post sale customer service costs 
we expect that our gross margin will vary from quarter to quarter due in part to variations in product mix 
for example  our gross margin percentages were   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
the increase in gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal is principally attributable to a shift in product mix toward higher margin blades 
to the extent that we introduce new products into the market  we anticipate our gross margin will fluctuate primarily as a function of our product mix 
research and product development fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated research and product development    percentage of sales see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
research and product development consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  prototype component and assembly costs  third party design services and consulting costs  and other costs related to design  development  and testing of our products 
research and product development costs are expensed as incurred  except for capital expenditures  which are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  generally two to five years 
research and product development expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in research and product development increased primarily as a result of the expense of increased personnel related costs  stock based compensation charges  and third party design costs also contributed to the increase in our research and development costs in research and product development expenses increased million or to million in compared to the increase in research and product development from to was attributable to increased personnel related costs  stock based compensation charges  and third party design costs 
sales and marketing fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated sales and marketing    percentage of sales see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
sales and marketing consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  and other personnel related costs  development and distribution of promotional materials  and other costs related to generating sales and conducting corporate marketing activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in sales and marketing increased primarily due to increased headcount  increased commission and other sales and promotional costs incurred in an effort to increase sales and market penetration 
we expect sales and marketing costs to continue to increase in as we continue to make expenditures aimed at increasing sales and market penetration in our target markets as well as in adjacent and international markets 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in sales and marketing increased due primarily to increased headcount  stock based compensation expense  commissions  and customer trial equipment expenses incurred to support our sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated general and administrative    percentage of sales general and administrative consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs for executive  finance  human resources  and administrative personnel 
additionally  general and administrative include professional fees  liability insurance and other general corporate costs 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to general and administrative increased primarily due to million of professional fees and expenses related to the audit committee investigation 
we also incurred additional general and administrative costs related to sarbanes oxley compliance  the terawave communications  inc asset purchase  additional headcount and stock based compensation expense 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease substantially in  mostly as a result of having completed the audit committee investigation in we expect this reduction to be partially offset by increased headcount and consulting costs deemed necessary to improve our processes and controls  add new functions and improve our human resources capabilities 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in general and administrative increased as a result of increased salaries  stock based compensation expense  and nasdaq relisting fees 
purchase of in process research and development during  we recorded charges for purchased in process research and development of million in october associated with our purchase of certain assets of terawave communcations  inc in october we had no such costs in and stock based compensation fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated cost of sales research and product development sales and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation   see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements 
through december   we recorded total deferred stock compensation of approximately million  representing the difference between the deemed value of our common stock for accounting purposes and the exercise price of the options on their date of grant 
we amortized deferred stock based compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options  or repurchase periods for the exercised options  generally over four years 
in addition  through december   we had reversed deferred stock compensation of approximately million  resulting from stock option cancellations and repurchase of unvested common shares from employees 
effective as of the first quarter of fiscal  we began recording the fair value of our share based compensation in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment revised  or sfas no 
r 
we anticipate that the stock based compensation expense calculated under sfas no 
r will continue to have a material effect on our consolidated statement of operations 
interest income and expense fiscal year ended december  december  december  restated interest income  interest expense see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements

these non cash charges were calculated using the deemed value of common stock on date of issuance  subtracting the accounting conversion price and then multiplying the resulting amount by the number of shares of common stock into which the series a preferred stock was convertible 
liquidity and capital resources comparison of and as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  stockholders equity of million  and working capital of million  compared with cash and cash equivalents of million  stockholders equity of million  and working capital of million as of december  the reduction in our cash and cash equivalents from december  to december  was primarily related to our net loss from operations for  including the cost of our internal investigation  leasehold improvements  asset purchases and purchases of performance bonds

in october we purchased certain assets of terawave communications  inc for million in cash and million in assumed liabilities  the objective of which was to acquire terawave s gigabit passive optical networking technology 
also contributing to the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was the increase from million to million in restricted cash related to the purchases of performance bonds which we were required to post in connection with our rus contracts

offsetting our cash balances was the repayment of million in outstanding indebtedness in february as of december   we had restricted cash of million related to performance bonds we are required to post in connection with our rus contracts 
we generated million of cash from operating activities during the fiscal year ended december   compared to a use of million in operating activities during the fiscal year ended december  the increase was principally attributable to increases in net income  accounts payable and deferred sales  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
we used million of cash in investing activities during the fiscal year ended december   compared to a use of million during the fiscal year ended december  the decrease was attributable to a smaller increase of restricted cash related to the purchase of performance bonds for rus contracts

also contributing to the increase in working capital was cash provided by net income  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenue  extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  extent to which we make acquisitions  cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  cost and timing of market and selling activities  and availability of borrowing arrangements and the availability of other means of financing 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to finance our operations over the next months 
although we believe these funds will be sufficient to maintain and expand our operations in accordance with our business strategy  we may need additional funds in the future 
if we are unable to raise additional financing when and if needed  we may be required to reduce certain discretionary spending  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives

for tax positions considered effectively settled  an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit  even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statue of limitations remains open

under sfas  a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable  available for sale and held to maturity securities  equity method investments  accounts payable  guarantees and issued debt 
other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at inception and non cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide warranty goods or services 
if the use of fair value is elected  any upfront cost and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure at fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  changes to fair value are recognized in earnings
