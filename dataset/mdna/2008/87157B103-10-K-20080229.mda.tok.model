these customers use our platforms and technology and services to manage both consumer and business customers  including over of the fortune companies 
revenues we generate a substantial portion of our revenues on a per transaction basis  most of which is derived from contracts that extend up to months from execution 
we have increased our revenues rapidly  growing at a compound annual growth rate of from to for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenues from transactions processed 
the remainder of our revenues were generated by professional services and subscription revenues 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses consist of cost of services  research and development  selling  general and administrative and depreciation 
cost of services includes all direct materials  direct labor and those indirect costs related to revenues such as indirect labor  materials and supplies 
our primary cost of services is related to our information technology and systems department  including network costs  data center maintenance  database management and data processing costs  as well as personnel costs associated with service implementation  customer deployment and customer care 
also included in cost of services are costs associated with our exception handling centers and the maintenance of those centers 
currently  we utilize a combination of employees and third party providers to process transactions through these centers 

table of contents research and development costs are expensed as incurred  unless they meet gaap criteria for deferral and amortization 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility do not meet these criteria  and are expensed as incurred 
no costs were deferred during the years ended december   and research and development expense consists primarily of costs related to personnel  including salaries and other personnel related expenses  consulting fees and the cost of facilities  computer and support services used in service technology development 
we also expense costs relating to developing modifications and minor enhancements of its existing technology and services 
selling expense consists of personnel costs including salaries  sales commissions  sales operations and other personnel related expense  travel and related expense  trade shows  costs of communications equipment and support services  facilities costs  consulting fees and costs of marketing programs  such as internet and print

depreciation relates to our property and equipment and includes our network infrastructure and facilities 
current trends affecting our results of operations we have experienced increased demand for our services  which has been driven by market trends such as various forms of order provisioning  local number portability  the implementation of new technologies  subscriber growth  competitive churn  network changes and consolidations in the industry 
in particular  the emergence of wireless order provisioning of e commerce transactions as well as voip  local number portability and the convergence of bundled services has increased the need for our services and will continue to be a factor contributing to competitive churn 
in addition  the increasing demand for converged services has led to the growth and mainstream adoption of smart phones 
to support the growth driven by the favorable industry trends mentioned above  we continue to look for opportunities to improve our operating efficiencies  such as the utilization of offshore technical and non technical resources for our exception handling center management 
we believe that these opportunities will continue to provide future benefits and position us to support revenue growth 
in addition  we anticipate further automation of the transactions generated by our more mature customers and additional transaction types 
these development efforts are expected to reduce exception handling costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during a fiscal period 
the securities and exchange commission sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to a company s financial condition and results of operations  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we have discussed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures in this form k 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  correct and reasonable under the circumstances  actual results may differ from those estimates 
we believe the following to be our critical accounting policies because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are uncertain 
if actual results or events differ materially from those contemplated by us in making these estimates  our reported financial condition and results of operations for future periods could be materially affected 
see risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition and deferred revenue we provide services principally on a transactional basis or  at times  on a fixed fee basis and recognize the revenues as the services are performed or delivered as discussed below transactional service arrangements transaction revenues consist of revenues derived from the processing of transactions through our service platforms and represented approximately of our revenues for the years ended december  and transaction service arrangements include services such as equipment orders  new account set up  number port requests  credit checks and inventory management 
transaction revenues are principally based on a set price per transaction and are recognized based on the number of transactions processed during each reporting period 
revenues are recorded based on the total number of transactions processed at the applicable price established in the relevant contract 
the total amount of revenues recognized is based primarily on the volume of transactions 
as automation rates increase  transaction costs for the csp decrease 
many of our contracts guarantee minimum volume transactions from the customer 
in these instances  if the customer s total transaction volume for the period is less than the contractual amount  we record revenues at the minimum guaranteed amount 
at times  transaction revenues may also include billings to customers based on the number of individuals dedicated to processing transactions 
set up fees for transactional service arrangements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the contract since these amounts would not have been paid by the customer without the related transactional service arrangement 
revenues are presented net of discounts  which are volume level driven  or credits  which are performance driven  and are determined in the period in which the volume thresholds are met or the services are provided 
deferred revenues represent principally setup fees with revenues recognized over the life of the contract 
professional service arrangements professional service revenues represented approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
professional services  when sold with transactional service arrangements  are accounted for separately when these services have value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the professional services 
when accounted for separately  professional service revenues are recognized on a monthly basis  as services are performed and all other elements of revenue recognition have been satisfied 
in determining whether professional services can be accounted for separately from transaction service revenues  we consider the following factors for each professional services agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence for fair value exists of the undelivered elements  the nature of the consulting services  the timing of when the consulting contract was signed in comparison to the transaction service start date and the contractual independence of the transactional service from the professional services 
if a professional service arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting  we would recognize the professional service revenues ratably over the remaining term of the transaction contract 
there were no such arrangements for the years ended december   and subscription service arrangements subscription service arrangements represented approximately and of our revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  and relate principally to our activationnow platform service which the customer accesses through a graphical user interface 
we record revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract for our subscription service contracts 
service level standards pursuant to certain contracts  we are subject to service level standards and to corresponding penalties for failure to meet those standards 
all performance related penalties are reflected as a corresponding reduction of our revenues 
these penalties  if applicable  are recorded in the month incurred 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance account is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balance outstanding 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit losses that we have in the past or that our reserves will be adequate 
if the financial condition of one of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in its inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period that this determination was made 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse or be utilized 
the realization of deferred tax assets is contingent upon the generation of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin to create a single model to address accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin as of january   as required and determined that the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
as of december   we have total unrecognized tax benefits of which includes for interest related to uncertain positions during the year ended december  we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of january  components of the reserve are classified as either current or long term in the consolidated balance sheet based on when we expect each of the items to be settled 
accordingly  we recorded a long term liability of on our balance sheet at december  that would reduce the effective tax rate if recognized 
we record interest and penalties accrued in relation to uncertain income tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
we did not accrue for interest or penalties as of december  or any period prior to tax returns for all years and thereafter are subject to future examination by tax authorities 
while we believe we have identified all reasonably identified exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
it is also possible that changes in facts and circumstances could cause us to either materially increase or reduce the carrying amount of its tax reserve 
stock based compensation as of december   we maintain two stock based compensation plans 
prior to january   we were applying the disclosure only provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted subsequent to january  and is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
under sfas r  an equity instrument is not considered to be issued until the instrument vests 
as a result  compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid in capital 
compensation expense also includes the amortization on a straight line basis over the remaining vesting period of the intrinsic values of the stock options granted prior to calculated in accordance with accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
we classify benefits of tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized excess tax benefits as a financing cash inflow with a corresponding operating cash outflow 

table of contents we utilize the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility was calculated based on a blended weighted average of historical information of similar public entities for which historical information was available 
we will continue to use this approach using other similar public entity volatility information until our historical volatility is relevant to measure expected volatility for future option grants 
the average expected life was determined using the sec shortcut approach as described in staff accounting bulletin sab  disclosure about fair value of financial instruments  which is the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common or preferred equity and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
forfeitures are estimated based on voluntary termination behavior  as well as a historical analysis of actual option forfeitures 
the weighted average assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model are as follows year ended year ended december  december  expected stock price volatility risk free interest rate expected life of options in years expected dividend yield the weighted average fair value as of the date of grant of the options granted was and per share for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the total stock based compensation cost related to non vested equity awards not yet recognized as an expense as of december  was approximately million

accordingly  quarterly amounts do not add to the annual amount because of differences in the weighted average common shares outstanding during each period principally due to the effect of the company s issuing shares of its common stock and options during the year 
gross profit excludes depreciation 
net income for the quarter ended september  included a discrete tax credit that increased net income by million and basic and diluted earnings per share by 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity has been cash provided by operations and by cash provided from our initial public offering ipo which was completed on june  the net proceeds from our offering and the exercise of the over allotment option by our ipo underwriters were approximately million  which enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was million at december   an increase of million as compared to the end of we anticipate that our principal uses of cash in the future will be to fund the expansion of our business and to expand our customer base internationally 
uses of cash will include facility expansion  capital expenditures and working capital

these offering costs were offset against the gross proceeds of our ipo and the exercise of the over allotment option 
discussion of cash flows cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is primarily due to income derived from increased volume from transactions and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses balances partially offset by an increase to accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets as well as an increase to tax benefit from stock option exercises 
income and accounts receivable grew primarily due to increased volume from transactions and timing of collections of customer accounts 
the accounts 
table of contents payable and accrued expenses accounts grew partially due to increased expenses necessary to support higher revenues as well as capital expenditures necessary to continue to grow our business 
cash flows from investing 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used of million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due to the increased purchase of fixed assets of million and net maturities of marketable securities 
cash flows from financing 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash provided of million for the year ended december  the difference of million was primarily due to net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock sold in our initial public offering completed last year with no corresponding equity sale in we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  the cash generated from our initial public offering and cash generated from our operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
effect of inflation although inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor and equipment  we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during  and contractual obligations our commitments consist of obligations under leases for office space  automobiles  computer equipment and furniture and fixtures 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations other long term liabilities total amount represents unrecognized tax positions recorded in our balance sheet 
although the timing of the settlement is uncertain  we believe this amount will be settled within years 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurement statement 
statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and establishes a hierarchy that categorizes and prioritizes the sources to be used to estimate fair value 
statement also expands financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp b which delays the effective date of statement for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
statement and fsp b are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected a partial deferral of statement under the provisions of fsp b related to the measurement of fair value used when evaluating goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment and valuing asset retirement obligations and liabilities for exit or disposal activities 
the impact of partially adopting statement effective january  is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas statement  which permits but does not require us to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  as we have not elected to fair value any of our financial instruments under the provisions of statement  the adoption of this statement will not have any impact to our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following discussion about market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we deposit our excess cash in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds and  we may be exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations on our short term investments  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature of these investments 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short and long term investments in a variety of securities  which could include commercial paper  money market funds and corporate debt securities 
our cash and cash equivalents at december  and included liquid money market accounts 
all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
we do not expect the current rate of inflation to have a material impact on our business 
the recent decline in the market value of certain securities backed by residential mortgage loans has led to a large liquidity crisis effecting the broader us housing market  the financial services industry and global financial markets 
investors in many industry sectors have experienced substantial decreases in asset valuations and uncertain market liquidity 
furthermore  credit rating authorities have  in many cases  been slow to respond to the rapid changes in the underlying value of certain securities and pervasive market illiquidity  regarding these securities 
as a result  this credit crisis may have a potential impact on the determination of the fair value of financial instruments or possibly require impairments in the future should the value of certain investments suffer a decline in value which is determined to be other than temporary 
we currently do not believe that any change in the market value of our money market funds to be material or warrant a determination of an other than temporary write down
