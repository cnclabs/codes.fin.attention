f f  which is attached hereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk acxiom s earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates primarily as a result of its term loan agreement and its revolving credit agreement  which bear interest at a floating rate 
acxiom does not currently use derivative or other financial instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk 
risk can be estimated by measuring the impact of a near term adverse movement of one percentage point in short term market interest rates 
if short term market interest rates increase one percentage point during the next four quarters compared to the previous four quarters  there would be no material adverse impact on acxiom s results of operations 
acxiom has no material future earnings or cash flow expenses from changes in interest rates related to its other long term debt obligations  as substantially all of acxiom s remaining long term debt instruments have fixed rates 
at both march  and  the fair value of the company s fixed rate long term obligations approximated carrying value 
acxiom has a presence in the united kingdom  france  the netherlands  germany  portugal  poland  australia and china 
in general  each of the foreign locations is expected to fund its own operations and cash flows  although funds may be loaned or invested from the us to the foreign subsidiaries 
therefore  exchange rate movements of foreign currencies may have an impact on acxiom s future costs or on future cash flows from foreign investments 
acxiom has not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
