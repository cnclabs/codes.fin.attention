the inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make appropriate estimates and assumptions to enable us to fairly present  in all material respects  our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole 
as of february   we operated upscale  high volume  casual dining restaurants under the cheesecake factory mark 
we also operated upscale casual dining restaurants under the grand lux cafe mark  one self service  limited menu express foodservice operation under the cheesecake factory express mark inside the disneyquest family entertainment center in orlando  florida  and two bakery production facilities 
we also licensed two limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory bakery cafe mark to another foodservice operator 
our revenues consist of sales from our restaurant operations and sales from our bakery operations to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales 
revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenues from bakery sales are recognized on transfer of title to customers 
we recognize a liability upon the sale of our gift cards and recognize revenue when these gift cards are redeemed in our restaurants or on our website 
revenues from unredeemed gift cards are recognized over three years based on historical and expected redemption trends 
these adjustments are classified as revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
new restaurants become eligible to enter our comparable sales calculations in their th month of operation 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december st for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal consisted of weeks and ended january  fiscal consisted of weeks  fiscal consisted of weeks 
the cheesecake factory is an upscale casual dining concept that offers approximately menu items including appetizers  pizza  seafood  steaks  chicken  burgers  pasta  specialty items  salads  sandwiches  omelets and desserts  including approximately varieties of cheesecake and other baked desserts 
grand lux cafe is also an upscale casual dining concept offering approximately menu items 
in contrast to many chain restaurant operations  substantially all of our menu items except desserts manufactured at our bakery production facilities are prepared on the restaurant premises using high quality  fresh ingredients based on innovative and proprietary recipes 
we believe our restaurants are recognized by consumers for offering exceptional value with generous food portions at moderate prices 
our restaurants distinctive  contemporary design and decor create a high energy ambiance in a casual setting 
our restaurants currently range in size from  to  interior square feet  provide full liquor service and are generally open seven days a week for lunch and dinner  as well as sunday brunch 
total restaurant sales represented  and of our revenues for fiscal  and  respectively  with bakery sales accounting for the remainder 
overview in addition to being highly competitive  the restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns  changes in general economic conditions  public safety conditions  demographic trends  weather conditions  the cost and availability of raw materials  labor and energy  purchasing power  and government regulations 
accordingly  as part of our strategy we must constantly evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to protect their longer term competitiveness and to maintain and enhance the strength of our brand 
our business strategy is focused on a prudent allocation of capital intended to enhance overall earnings per share growth and increase returns on invested capital 
operationally  we strive to improve productivity and efficiency through the use of technology and a commitment to selecting  training and retaining high quality employees 
our overall value proposition is to continue to provide exceptional value through a broad menu of freshly prepared  high quality and large portion appetizers  entrees and desserts at moderate prices in an upscale casual setting 
in evaluating and assessing the performance of our business  we believe the following are key performance indicators that should be taken into consideration new restaurant openings 
we intend to continue developing the cheesecake factory and grand lux cafe restaurants in high quality  high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets 
we apply a disciplined approach to site selection  choosing only premier sites that can deliver high margins 
the majority of our revenue growth will continue to come from new restaurant openings 
comparable sales increases at existing restaurants and increased bakery sales will also contribute to overall revenue growth 
in fiscal  we opened new restaurants  including five grand lux cafes 
in fiscal  we expect to open between six and eight new cheesecake factory restaurants and the initial unit of our newest concept  rock sugar pan asian kitchen see new concepts in part i  item of this report  which we plan to open in the second quarter of fiscal general and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues 
efficiently scaling our restaurant and bakery support infrastructure will allow us to grow general and administrative expenses at a slower rate than revenue growth over the longer term 
income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenues operating margins 
operating margins are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs  labor  other operating costs and expenses  such as restaurant level occupancy expenses  and preopening expenses 
our objective is to gradually increase our operating margin by continuing our focus on superior guest service and by capturing economies of scale and fixed cost leverage  as well as maximizing our purchasing power as our business grows 
return on invested capital roic 
return on invested capital measures our ability to make the best decisions about how we allocate our capital 
roic is affected by the cost to build restaurants  the level of revenues that the restaurant can deliver and our ability to maximize the profitability of restaurants through strict cost management 
our objective is to deploy capital towards new restaurant openings and share repurchases in a manner that will maximize our roic 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of operations expressed as percentages of revenues 
fiscal years  and included million  million and million of stock based compensation expense  representing  and of revenues  respectively

in fiscal year  stock based compensation impacted labor expenses and general and administrative expenses by and  respectively 
in fiscal  stock based compensation impacted labor expenses and general and administrative expenses by and  respectively  and impacted other operating costs and expenses and preopening costs by on a combined basis 
for fiscal year  the impact of stock based compensation was on labor and general and administrative expenses on a combined basis 
fiscal year revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest expense interest income other income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior fiscal year 
the resulting sales increase of million consisted of million  or a  increase in comparable restaurant sales and million increase from restaurants not in the comparable sales base 
comparable restaurant sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants increased approximately from fiscal we implemented an approximate effective menu price increase during our winter menu update in january and february  and an approximate effective menu price increase during our summer menu update in july and august on a weighted basis  we estimate that we had an approximate effective menu price increase during fiscal the increase in comparable sales for fiscal was below our effective menu price increase for the year due to reduced traffic at our restaurants  due primarily to the macro economic factors affecting the restaurant industry in general 
comparable sales at the grand lux cafes increased approximately over fiscal year grand lux cafe sales benefited in part from an approximate effective menu price increase implemented in october and an approximate menu price increase implemented in april since grand lux cafe is a relatively newer concept and still building its customer base  we expect comparable sales growth to outpace menu price increases for the foreseeable future 
total restaurant operating weeks increased to  compared to  fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week decreased approximately in fiscal to  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in average weekly sales is due principally to the increased openings at grand lux cafes  which we expect to open with average sales per week lower than the existing grand lux cafe base  and decreased restaurant traffic in general 
during fiscal  our goal is to open between seven and nine new restaurants  consisting of six to eight cheesecake factory restaurants as well as the initial unit of our newest concept  rock sugar pan asian kitchen 
as in past years  most of our potential restaurant openings for fiscal will likely occur during the second half of the year 
although it is difficult for us to predict the timing of our new restaurant openings by quarter  due to the nature of our leased restaurant locations and our highly customized layouts  our current plan calls for three restaurants opening in the second quarter  with the remaining openings in the second half of the year 
we presently update and reprint the menus in our restaurants twice a year 
for cheesecake factory restaurants  these updates generally occur during january and february the winter menu change and during july and august the summer menu change 
for our winter menu change  we implemented an approximate effective menu price increase for the purpose of offsetting those operating cost and expense increases that were known or expected as of january we plan to review our operating cost and expense trends in the spring of and consider the need for additional menu pricing in connection with our summer menu change 
all potential menu price increases must be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily due to lower sales to the warehouse clubs  which accounted for approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal  partially offset by increased sales of the dream factory and private label products in other distribution channels 
we strive to develop and maintain long term  growing relationships with our bakery customers  based largely on our year reputation for producing high quality  creative baked desserts 
however  bakery sales volumes will always be less predictable than our restaurant sales 
it is difficult to predict the timing of bakery product shipments and contribution margins on a quarterly basis  as the purchasing plans of our large account customers may fluctuate 
due to the highly competitive nature of the bakery business  we are unable to enter into long term contracts with our large account bakery customers  who may discontinue purchasing our products without advance notice at any time for any reason 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of food  beverage  retail and bakery production supply costs incurred in conjunction with our restaurant and bakery revenues  and excludes depreciation  which is captured separately in depreciation and amortization expenses 
cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to favorable year over year pricing for produce  seafood and general grocery items 
these benefits were partially offset by cost pressures in dairy commodities 
the menus at our restaurants are among the most diversified in the foodservice industry and accordingly  are not overly dependent on a single commodity 
changes in costs for one commodity are often  but not always  counterbalanced by cost changes in other commodity categories 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include fresh produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other fresh dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
we are currently able to contract for the majority of the food commodities used in our operations for periods of up to one year 
with the exception of cream cheese used in our bakery operations  many of the fresh commodities  such as fish  dairy  and certain produce products are not currently contractible for periods longer than days in most cases 
as a result  these fresh commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due principally to weather and other general agricultural conditions 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products  with an expected requirement of as much as million to million pounds during fiscal we have contracted for a portion of our cream cheese requirements for fiscal we will also purchase cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our agreements 
as has been our past practice  we will carefully consider opportunities to introduce new menu items and implement selected menu price increases to help offset expected cost increases for key commodities and other goods and services utilized by our operations 
while we have been successful in the past in reacting to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for these commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher than normal during the first to days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
labor expenses labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor  including associated fringe benefits  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally in support of the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase in fiscal was primarily due to increased minimum wages in several states in which we operate as well as increased health insurance costs for our staff members 
in addition  while we manage our labor judiciously to adapt to revenue fluctuations  we expect to experience some de leveraging of labor costs at lower sales levels as we are committed to delivering the level of service our guests expect  while still achieving reasonable labor costs 
stock based compensation included in labor expenses was million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first to days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
labor expenses can be subject to unforeseen increases for reasons beyond our control such as government mandated increases in minimum wages and tip credit levels  paid or unpaid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits  or increased tax reporting  assessment or payment requirements 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  insurance  licenses  taxes  and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal higher janitorial and utility costs and the de leveraging of fixed cost maintenance contracts due to lower average weekly sales at our restaurants accounted for the majority of this increase 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  the restaurant field supervision organization  the bakery administrative organization and the corporate support organization 
g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal g a expenses included stock based compensation expense of million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in fiscal and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to increases in property and equipment associated with new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened cheesecake factory restaurants and grand lux cafe restaurants during fiscal compared to cheesecake factory restaurants and one grand lux cafe restaurants during fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress 
we also incurred preopening costs of million in fiscal in conjunction with our second bakery production facility  which opened in the first quarter of preopening costs include incremental out of pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants that are not otherwise capitalizable 
as a result of the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale  high volume concepts  the restaurant preopening process for our new restaurants is more extensive  time consuming and costly relative to that of most chain restaurant operations 
the preopening costs for one of our restaurants usually includes costs to relocate and compensate an average of to restaurant management employees prior to opening  costs to recruit and train an average of to hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  costs for practice service activities  and straight line base rent expense subsequent to the construction period but prior to restaurant opening 
preopening costs will vary from location to location depending on a number of factors  including the proximity of our existing restaurants  the size and physical layout of each location  the number of management and hourly employees required to open each restaurant  the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing process  the cost of travel to and lodging for different metropolitan areas  and the extent of unexpected delays  if any  in construction and or obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurants  which also may be caused by landlord delays 
our preopening cost for a typical single story cheesecake factory restaurant in an established market averages approximately million to million 
in addition to the direct costs noted above  there are also other preopening costs allocated to each restaurant opening  including costs for maintaining a roster of trained managers for pending openings  corporate travel and support activities 
preopening costs are usually higher for larger restaurants  our initial entry into new markets and for newer concepts 
we usually incur the most significant portion of direct preopening costs within the two month period immediately preceding and the month of a restaurant s opening 
preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant 
we expense preopening costs as incurred 
interest expense  interest income and other income interest expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to million of interest expense related to borrowings of million on our revolving credit facility initiated in fiscal in addition  we recorded interest expense of approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to lower investment balances driven by significant treasury stock purchases during other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to the fiscal contribution of land and a building for our north carolina bakery production facility by the local government  in exchange for commitments from us to create jobs and operate a manufacturing plant in the community 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase from the prior year was primarily attributable to state taxes and changes in our reserve for uncertain tax positions related to the adoption of fasb interpretation no

restaurant sales increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior fiscal year 
after adjusting for million of restaurant sales contributed by the additional operating week in fiscal  restaurant sales would have increased by when compared to sales of  million measured on a week basis 
the resulting sales increase of million on a comparable week basis consisted of million  or a  decrease in comparable restaurant sales and million increase from restaurants not in the comparable sales base 
by concept  comparable restaurant sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants decreased approximately and comparable sales at the grand lux cafes increased approximately 
sales in comparable cheesecake factory restaurants were impacted by a general reduction in dining occasions due to macro economic factors  as experienced by many in the restaurant industry  offset partially by an approximate effective menu price increase implemented during january and february we did not take an effective menu price increase during july and august sales in comparable grand lux cafes benefited from an approximate effective menu price increase implemented in october total restaurant operating weeks increased to  compared to  on a week basis for fiscal average sales per restaurant operating week at the cheesecake factory restaurants in fiscal decreased approximately to  compared to  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in average weekly sales in excess of the decrease in comparable sales is due principally to two factors 
first  the average productive square feet and seats at restaurants not in the comparable base are approximately less than restaurants opened in the comparable sales base 
second  the weekly sales volumes at several newer restaurants are gradually decreasing  as expected  from their initial grand opening or honeymoon sales levels to their sustainable and expected run rate levels 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
after adjusting for million of bakery sales contributed by the additional operating week in fiscal  bakery sales would have increased to million compared to million on a week basis 
this increase was primarily due to higher sales to our warehouse club customers  which accounted for approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal  as well as increased sales of the dream factory and private label products 
cost of sales cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales and the increase in bakery sales during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  these costs decreased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was primarily attributable to reduced costs compared to the prior year for a variety of commodities used in our restaurants  particularly poultry 
labor expenses labor expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally in support of the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal fiscal included million  or of revenues  of stock based compensation expense related to our fiscal adoption of sfas r 
the remaining increase in labor as a percent of revenues is attributable to the decrease in average sales per week 
while we manage our labor judiciously to adapt to revenue fluctuations  we expect to experience some de leveraging of labor costs at lower sales levels as we are committed to delivering the level of service our guests expect  while still achieving reasonable labor costs 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal higher utility costs and the de leveraging of fixed cost maintenance contracts due to lower average weekly sales at our restaurants accounted for the majority of this increase 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the addition of million in stock based compensation expense related to our fiscal adoption of sfas r and the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this percentage increase was principally due to the addition of of revenues  in stock based compensation expense  as compared to million  or less than of revenues  of stock based compensation expense in fiscal under apb opinion no 
in addition  we incurred million of professional fees in fiscal associated with the review of our historical stock option granting practices 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to increases in property and equipment associated with new restaurant openings and the second bakery production facility

income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease from the prior year was primarily attributable to the application of a manufacturing deduction  reversal of an accrual previously established for an uncertain tax position  and lower effective state taxes 
fiscal outlook in fiscal  we plan to open between seven and nine new restaurants  consisting of six to eight cheesecake factory restaurants  as well as the initial unit of our newest concept  rock sugar pan asian kitchen 
we expect revenue growth in the range of to and diluted earnings per share growth of between and 
the reduced number of openings in fiscal  associated reduction in cash capital expenditures and related lower preopening costs are expected to drive free cash flow of approximately million to million in fiscal we plan to utilize this free cash flow  as well as incremental leverage opportunities in the range of million to million  to support additional share repurchases throughout the year 
liquidity and capital resources our corporate finance strategy is to maintain a strong  conservative balance sheet in order to support our growth plan with financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and bakery operations  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations on a larger scale 
our ongoing capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plan  though we also intend to use a portion of our capital to fund the repurchase of shares pursuant to our repurchase authorization 
similar to many restaurant and retail chain store operations  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while most of our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet  the minimum base rents and related fixed obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants  further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures  and maintain and expand our bakery production capacity 
in the past  we have obtained capital from our ongoing operations  public stock offerings  employee stock option exercises and construction contributions from our landlords 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale  and we are able to sell many of our food inventory items before payment is due to the suppliers of such items 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key liquidity measurements dollar amounts in millions january  january  january  cash and marketable securities on hand net working capital adjusted net working capital current ratio adjusted current ratio long term debt and deemed landlord financing liability  including current portion includes all marketable securities classified as either current assets million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively or noncurrent assets million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal year cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures during fiscal  our total amount of cash and marketable securities on hand decreased by million to million as of january  this decrease was principally due to the purchase of treasury stock and property and equipment  partially offset by borrowing on our credit facility  cash provided by operating activities  landlord construction contributions and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
in the table above  we present adjusted net working capital and current ratio calculations that include all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
we believe these adjusted calculations provide investors with useful information regarding our overall liquidity position because all marketable securities are readily available to meet our liquidity requirements 
we continue to target a weighted average maturity for our marketable securities investment portfolio between one and two years 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our investments is classified as noncurrent assets  but remains available for our liquidity requirements 
on april   we entered into a five year revolving credit facility facility with a maximum available borrowing capacity of million 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the london interbank offering rate libor plus a spread ranging from to  depending on our ratio of debt to trailing month earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and noncash stock option expense ebitda  as defined in the agreement 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee ranging from to  also depending on our ratio of debt to ebitda  calculated on the average unused portion of the facility 
the outstanding borrowings under this facility were used to support the accelerated share repurchase we entered into on march   as well as subsequent treasury stock purchases 
availability under the facility is reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit  which are used to support our self insurance programs 
as of january   we had net availability for borrowings of million  based on outstanding debt of million and million in standby letters of credit 
the facility provides that we will maintain certain financial covenants  which include a debt to ebitda ratio below a specified threshold  as well as a minimum ebitdar ebitda plus rental expense  as defined in the agreement  to interest and rental expense ratio 
at january   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we are in discussions with our lenders to increase our revolving credit facility by approximately million to million 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain an increase in the desired amount or at terms acceptable to us 
the availability and terms of additional financing are subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including general economic conditions 
we plan to use any increase  together with expected free cash flows from operations  to fund the repurchase of shares pursuant to our repurchase authorization 
landlord construction allowances related to restaurant locations for which we are deemed  for accounting purposes only  to have an ownership interest are reflected in our balance sheets as deemed landlord financing 
this liability is amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
our new restaurant development model more closely resembles that of a retail business that occupies leased space in shopping malls  lifestyle centers  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers and other real estate developments 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary from lease to lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example  our prorata share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out our leased premises 
we may also disburse cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in the respective leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
we do not have any current plans to encumber our existing leasehold interests with secured financing 
we own substantially all of the equipment  furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
during fiscal  our capital expenditures were million 
new restaurant openings including several restaurants under development as of january  accounted for million of this amount 
approximately million of new restaurant capital expenditures were funded through deemed landlord financing 
of the remaining capital expenditures  million represented maintenance and capacity addition outlays for our existing restaurants  and approximately million was for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our cash outlays for capital expenditures to range between million and million  net of agreed upon up front cash landlord construction contributions and excluding million to million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
this amount also excludes approximately million of landlord construction contributions to be applied as reductions to minimum or percentage rent over the lease terms 
the amount reflected as additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows may vary from this estimate based on the accounting treatment of each operating lease see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
this estimate contemplates a net outlay of million to million for as many as nine restaurants to be opened during fiscal  including our newest concept  rock sugar pan asian kitchen  estimated construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings and estimated collections of up front cash landlord construction contributions 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include approximately million to million for maintenance and capacity addition expenditures to our existing restaurants and million to million for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
based on our current expansion objectives  we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  combined with expected cash flows provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through the foreseeable future 
we are in discussions with our lenders to increase our revolving credit facility by approximately million to million 
we plan to use any increase  together with expected free cash flows from operations  to fund the repurchase of shares pursuant to our repurchase authorization 
we may seek additional funds to finance our growth in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
our board of directors increased the share repurchase authorization of our common shares by million shares during fiscal and by million shares in february for a total authorization of million shares 
under these authorizations  we have cumulatively repurchased million shares at a total cost of million through january  during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
the share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and it does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares 
this authorization may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time 
the timing and number of shares repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase authorization will be subject to a number of factors  including current market conditions  legal constraints and available cash or other sources of funding 
shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
our share repurchase plan will be used to return excess capital to shareholders in years when new restaurant site availability does not meet our criteria  as well as to minimize the dilutive impact of our stock option programs 
as of february   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following schedules summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  amounts in millions payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations operating leases long term debt purchase obligations fin liability total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit represents aggregate minimum lease payments for our restaurant operations  automobiles and certain equipment  including amounts characterized as deemed landlord financing payments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction

we expect to fund our contractual obligations primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 
as discussed above  we are in discussions with our lenders to increase our revolving credit facility by approximately million to million see liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets or the primary lease terms of the respective leases plus any exercised extensions of those lease terms  whichever is shorter 
for leasehold improvements purchased after the inception of a lease  the amortization period is the lesser of the useful life or a period that reflects lease renewals that are reasonably assured upon purchase 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgment by management  which may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than if different assumptions were used 
impairment of long lived assets we assess potential impairments of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the recoverability is assessed in most cases by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
leases we currently lease all of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and subsequent amendments which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
minimum base rent for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the initial lease term and those renewal periods that are reasonably assured 
the initial rent term includes the build out  or rent holiday period  for our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
contingent rent expense  which is based on a percentage of revenue  is also recorded to the extent it exceeds minimum base rent per the lease agreement 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
depending on the specifics of the leased space  the lease agreement and in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  the amounts paid for structural components will be recorded during the construction period as either prepaid rent or construction in progress and the landlord construction contributions will be recorded as either an offset to prepaid rent or as a deemed landlord financing liability 
upon completion of construction for those leases that meet the criteria of eitf  the lease may qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
for these leases  the deemed landlord financing liability and the associated construction in progress will be removed and the difference will be reclassified to prepaid or deferred rent and amortized over the lease term as an increase or decrease to rent expense 
if the lease does not qualify for sale leaseback treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 the deemed landlord financing liability will be amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
self insurance liability we retain the financial responsibilty for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  employee health benefits and other insurable risks 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgment regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  case jurisdiction  applicable legislation and our claims settlement practices 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our individual claim exposure for each of our programs and for aggregate exposure on our employee health benefits program 
the estimated amounts receivable from our third party insurers under this coverage are recorded in other receivables 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr amounts as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
stock based compensation we maintain performance incentive plans under which incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted shares  deferred shares  performance shares and performance units may be granted to employees and consultants 
non employee directors may receive non qualified stock options only 
to date  we have only granted non qualified stock options and restricted shares under these plans 
stock options generally vest at per year or cliff vest in five years  expire ten years from the date of grant  and become exercisable provided that we or the grantee meet or exceed certain performance criteria approved by our board of directors 
restricted shares generally vest after three years and are not subject to performance criteria 
prior to the january  adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and therefore  recognized expense for certain grants of stock options that were issued at a discount to directors  officers and employees 
as permitted by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  stock based compensation based on grant date fair value was included as a pro forma disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and as a result  did not retroactively adjust results from prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation was recognized for expense related to the remaining unvested portion of all stock option awards granted prior to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and expense related to all stock option awards granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share based payments to employees  which is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time we prepare our income tax provision 
in making our estimates  we also consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we update our estimates  which  in turn  may result in adjustments to our effective tax rate 
we usually file our income tax returns within nine to ten months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which became effective for us beginning in fiscal fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
under fin  we must recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
the impact of our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
our estimates may change in the future due to new developments 
for additional information regarding the adoption of fin  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   except for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis  which have been deferred for one year 
we do not expect the impact of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the impact of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our profitability is dependent  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant and bakery customers 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for many of our fresh commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations for periods longer than days 
consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect the profitability of our restaurant and bakery operations 
many of our restaurant and bakery employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage 
in fiscal  congress enacted an increase in the federal minimum wage implemented in two phases  beginning in fiscal and concluding in fiscal in addition  numerous state and local governments increased the minimum wage within their jurisdictions  with further state minimum wage increases going into effect in fiscal additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  macro economic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues and net income for our established restaurants have occurred in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
approximately two thirds of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available productive seating for all restaurants open as of january  and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
holidays  severe weather  hurricanes  thunderstorms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
we are exposed to market risk from interest rate changes on funded debt 
this exposure relates to the portion of the interest rate on our million revolving credit facility facility that is indexed to three month libor 
on april   we entered into a five year  zero cost interest rate collar to hedge million of the facility 
the interest rate collar consists of a combination of a purchased cap option with a three month libor cap rate of and a sold floor option with a three month libor floor rate of 
on october   we entered into another zero cost interest rate collar to hedge interest rate variability on an additional million of our revolving credit facility 
this interest rate collar consists of a combination of a purchased cap option with a three month libor cap rate of and a sold floor option with a three month libor floor rate of 
at january   we had million in debt outstanding under the facility 
since a portion of this debt is hedged  a hypothetical interest rate increase would only have a million impact on our results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes us to market risk related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of january  and january   we held million and million in available for sale marketable securities  respectively 
a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in million and million of unrealized losses and a corresponding decline in their fair values at january  and january   respectively 
this hypothetical decline would not affect our cash flows unless the securities were disposed of 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based on market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
however  we are currently unable to contract for many of our fresh commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations for periods longer than days 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
in addition  we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
