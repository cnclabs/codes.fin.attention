overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states and the district of columbia as of december  we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations 
we also maintain an investment in national cinemedia  which has primarily concentrated its efforts on the expansion of in theatre advertising and the creation of complementary business lines that leverage the existing operating personnel  asset and customer bases of its theatrical exhibition partners  which includes us  amc and cinemark 
the company manages its business under one reportable segment theatre exhibition operations 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs and electronic video games located adjacent to the lobbies of certain of our theatres 
in addition  national cinemedia provides us with a theatre access fee associated with revenues generated from its sale of on screen advertising  rental of theatres for business meetings and concerts and other events 
film rental costs depend on a variety of factors including the prospects of a film and the popularity of a film and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs 
on february   we  along with amc and cinemark  formed a joint venture company known as digital cinema implementation partners  llc  a delaware limited liability company dcip  to explore the possibility of implementing digital cinema in our theatres and to create a financing model and establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the implementation of digital cinema 
travis reid  the former president and chief executive officer of loews theatres  serves as the chief executive officer of dcip and dcip has engaged jp morgan securities inc to assist with the review of a business plan for digital cinema and with identifying and evaluating potential financing and capital structure alternatives 
future digital cinema developments will be managed by dcip  subject to the approval of us  amc and cinemark 
each of regal  amc and cinemark has an equal ownership interest in dcip 
we expect to begin converting our existing theatres from mm film projection to digital projection during the second half of and intend to complete the conversion of our entire circuit in approximately three to four years 
dcip is continuing to work with film studios and financial institutions to negotiate and finalize the related financing plans that would provide for a studio financed conversion to digital projection 
on february   ncm  inc  a newly formed entity that serves as the sole manager of national cinemedia  completed an ipo of its common stock 
in connection with the series of transactions completed in connection with the ipo  regal received gross cash proceeds totaling approximately million and retained a interest in ncm  inc after the payment of current taxes  net cash proceeds from these transactions totaled approximately million

recent developments as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  on january   the company entered into an agreement to acquire consolidated theatres  llc consolidated theatres for a total cash purchase price of approximately million 
the proposed acquisition will add a total of theatres with screens in georgia  maryland  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee and virginia 
consummation of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to be completed by the end of regal s second fiscal quarter of results of operations the fiscal year was a success for both the industry and the company 
based on our review of industry sources  national box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to regal s fiscal year were estimated to have increased by approximately in comparison to the fiscal year 
the industry s success in was driven primarily by ticket price increases and also benefited from the success of top tier films including spider man  transformers  pirates of the caribbean at world s end  shrek the third  and harry potter the order of the phoenix 
our total revenues for the year ended december  fiscal period were  million and consisted of  million of admissions revenue  million of concessions revenues and million of other operating revenues  and increased from total revenues of  million for the year ended december  fiscal period 
our fiscal period admissions revenues increased over the fiscal period 
price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews which include analysis of various factors including general inflationary trends and local market conditions and a favorable mix of film product exhibited during the fiscal period were the primary drivers of a increase in our average ticket price and led to the increase in admissions revenue despite a decline in attendance 
we believe that the decline in attendance was primarily a result of a lack of breadth in the fiscal period film slate 
based on our review of certain industry sources  the increase in our admissions revenues was in line with the industry s results for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period 
in addition  during the fiscal period  we experienced growth in average concessions revenues per patron and a decline in other operating revenues 
the growth in average concessions revenues per patron was primarily attributable to price increases  concession friendly films exhibited during the fiscal period  such as spider man  transformers  pirates of the caribbean at world s end  shrek the third  harry potter the order of the phoenix and ratatouille and a favorable mix of concession products sold during the fiscal period 
the decrease in other operating revenues in the fiscal period was primarily attributable to a modification of the payment arrangement with national cinemedia effective upon consummation of the ipo of ncm  inc on february  described in further detail under note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
income from operations increased to million for the fiscal period compared to million in the fiscal period 
the net increase in income from operations during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to incremental admissions and concessions revenues described above  partially offset by lower other operating revenues and increases in various operating expense items described in further detail below 
net income increased to million in the fiscal period compared to net income of million in the fiscal period 
earnings per diluted share also increased to for the fiscal period compared to during the fiscal period 
the increases in net income and earnings per diluted share were primarily due to the increase in operating income as described above  a million gain million after related tax effects resulting from transactions completed in connection with the ipo of ncm  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion  a million gain million after related tax effects resulting from transactions completed in connection with the sale of our equity interest in fandango see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion  the impact of earnings recognized from ncm  a reduction of net interest expense  and the impact of a million loss million after related tax effects on debt extinguishment recorded in the fiscal period in connection with conversions of a portion of the company s convertible senior notes 
during the fiscal period  we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives on february   ncm  inc completed an ipo of its common stock 
in connection with the series of transactions completed in connection with the ipo  we received gross cash proceeds totaling million and retained a interest in ncm  inc after the payment of current taxes  net cash proceeds from these transactions totaled approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for additional discussion of these transactions 
the company used a portion of the net cash proceeds to fund an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of its class a and class b common stock  or approximately million in the aggregate 
stockholders of record at the close of business on march  were paid this million dividend on april  we expect to use the remaining net cash proceeds along with additional cash on hand for the acquisition of consolidated theatres described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
we continue to believe that our investment in national cinemedia will provide incremental value for our stockholders 
we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
total cash dividends distributed to our stockholders during the fiscal period totaled approximately million  including an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of its class a and class b common stock 
we opened new theatres with screens  added screens through expansion and closed underperforming theatres with screens  ending the fiscal period with theaters and  screens 
finally  we continued to embrace new technologies that enhance the movie going experience and generate incremental revenue for the company 
during the fiscal period  we opened our first two test theatres fully outfitted with digital projection systems  increased our d screen count to and increased our imax auditoriums to we remain optimistic regarding the benefits of digital cinema primarily as it relates to future growth potential associated with d film product and other d content and are pleased to see continued support of d and imax film product by the major studios 
we are optimistic regarding the breadth of the film slate and the timing of the release schedule and share the view of a number of film studio executives and analysts who believe the industry is poised to benefit from a year of solid box office performance 
evidenced by the film studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as chronicles of narnia prince caspian  indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull  iron man  kung fu panda  the incredible hulk  wall e  hancock  the dark knight  madagascar the crate escape  quantum of solace and harry potter and the half blood prince 
we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  subject to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and replacements 
overall for the fiscal year  we expect to benefit from the impact of a week fiscal year along with modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron 
in addition  we expect fiscal admission and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations 
we will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  selective upgrades and providing incremental returns to our stockholders

fiscal period net cash flows generated from operating activities were impacted by several factors including an increase in total revenues due primarily to increases in attendance coupled with increases in average ticket prices and average concessions per patron  offset by increases in certain expense items 
an approximate million increase in adjustments primarily losses on extinguishment of debt  equity in earnings of joint venture including former employee compensation  share based compensation and a greater loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities  offset by a million decrease in net income and a million reduction of changes in operating assets and liabilities  contributed to the net decrease in net cash provided by operating activities 
the net decrease in the changes in operating assets and liabilities and other working capital items was primarily related to the timing of income tax payments and to a lesser extent  the timing of certain vendor payments and a reclassification of excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements to cash flows used in financing activities discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in investing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period

net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million for the fiscal period compared to cash flows used in financing activities of approximately million for the fiscal period 
the net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period was primarily attributable to incremental borrowings under the senior credit facility and the reclassification of excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements from cash flows from operating activities discussed further in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  partially offset by net cash used to settle conversions of approximately million in principal amount of the company s convertible senior notes and the payment of debt acquisition costs 
liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  capital expenditures  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service  share repurchases and the company s quarterly dividend payments 
the principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and borrowings under the fifth amended and restated credit facility the amended senior credit facility with credit suisse  cayman island branch as successor to credit suisse first boston as administrative agent and other lenders party thereto  described below 
under the terms of the amended senior credit facility  regal cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to regal  its indirect parent 
since regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of subsidiaries  this restriction could impact regal s ability to effect future debt or dividend payments  pay corporate expenses or redeem or convert for cash its convertible senior notes 
our revenues are generally collected in cash through admissions and concessions revenues 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company s concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately days from purchase 
our current liabilities generally include items that will become due within twelve months 
in addition  from time to time  we use cash from operations and borrowings to fund dividends in excess of net income and cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing and financing activities 
as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit 
we fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows  cash on hand  proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities 
our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre construction  adding new screens to existing theatres  upgrading the company s theatre facilities including digital d and imax screens and replacing equipment 
should the conversion process to digital cinema rapidly accelerate and the major studios not cover the cost of the conversion as expected  we may have to incur additional capital expenditures associated with this potential change 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
the company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects  with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the company s internal rate of return targets 
we currently expect capital expenditures for theatre development  replacement  expansion  upgrading and replacements to be in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal year  exclusive of acquisitions 
such capital expenditures are expected to be partially funded through asset dispositions conducted during the normal course of our business 
during the fiscal period  we invested approximately million in capital expenditures 
on february   ncm  inc  a newly formed entity that serves as the sole manager of national cinemedia  completed an ipo of its common stock

the theatre access fee is composed of a fixed payment per patron which will increase by every five years starting at the end of fiscal and a fixed payment per digital screen each year  which will increase by annually starting at the end of fiscal in addition  from time to time  common units of national cinemedia held by the joint venture partners will be adjusted through a formula primarily based on theatre attendance generated by each joint venture partner

ebitda ebitda was approximately million  or of total revenues for the fiscal period  million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal period and million  or of total revenues  for the fiscal period 
the increase in ebitda for the fiscal period was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income described above  an approximate million gain recorded in the fiscal period resulting from transactions completed in connection with the ipo of ncm  inc see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion  the million gain received in connection with the sale of the company s equity interest in fandango during the fiscal period and the impact of a million loss on debt extinguishment recorded in the fiscal period in connection with conversions of a portion of the company s convertible senior notes 
the company uses ebitda as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity  excluding the impact of interest  taxes  and non cash depreciation and amortization charges  for servicing our debt  paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs  prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash  such as working capital items 
we believe that ebitda is useful to investors for these purposes as well 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net cash provided by operating activities  as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  since it omits the impact of interest  taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash such as receivables  payables and inventories as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items such as long term loss accruals and deferred items 
because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized  which assets will often have to be replaced in the future 
further  ebitda  because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service  income taxes  cash dividends  capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this annual report on form k  does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes 
nonetheless  ebitda is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors  rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe  and we concur  that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures  pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs  respectively 
we also evaluate ebitda because it is clear that movements in these non gaap measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends 
ebitda  as calculated  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows in millions fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period ebitda interest expense  net provision for income taxes deferred income taxes gain on sale of fandango interest changes in operating assets and liabilities loss on debt extinguishment other items  net net cash provided by operating activities contractual cash obligations and commitments the company has assumed long term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  primarily debt obligations and non cancelable operating leases

we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
such lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the leases at defined or then fair value rental rates for various periods 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements 
our operating lease obligations are further described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
these amounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and represent liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
the table does not include approximately million of recorded liabilities associated with unrecognized tax benefits for which we do not believe that the amount and timing of the payments are reasonably estimable 
under the terms of new incremental term loan  regal cinemas may request the establishment of an additional term loan in a principal amount of up to million 
the new incremental term loan is only available if regal is able to obtain the commitments of new or existing lenders that are willing to provide funding for such new incremental term loan and the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the amended senior credit facility

regal cinemas also maintains a sublimit within the revolving facility of million for short term loans and million for letters of credit

interest rate swaps on july   regal cinemas entered into four hedging relationships via four distinct interest rate swap agreements with final maturity terms ranging from three to five years each 
on september   regal cinemas entered into an additional hedging relationship via a distinct interest rate swap agreement with a maturity term of four years 
these interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately  million of its variable rate debt obligations 
on june   one of our interest rate swaps designated to hedge approximately million of variable rate debt obligations matured 
on august   regal cinemas entered into two additional hedging relationships via two distinct interest rate swap agreements with maturity terms of two years each 
these interest rate swaps were designated to hedge approximately million of variable rate debt obligations 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements  regal cinemas pays interest at various fixed rates ranging from to and will receive interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swaps for the following three month period 
the interest rate swaps settle any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swaps will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swaps  because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swaps represented prevailing rates for each counterparty at the time the interest rate swaps were entered into 
the interest rate swaps qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month libor on approximately  million of debt 
the change in the fair values of the interest rate swaps is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swaps gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instruments the six interest rate swaps will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of each swap 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps is based on dealer quotes  and represents an estimate of the amounts regal cinemas would receive or pay to terminate the agreements taking into consideration various factors  including current interest rates 
as of december   the aggregate fair value of the interest rate swaps was determined to be approximately million  which has been recorded as a component of other non current liabilities with a corresponding amount of million  net of tax  recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which include those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions 
under purchase accounting principles  we are required to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities  including i the acquired tangible and intangible assets  including property and equipment  ii the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition  and iii the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations  for significant acquisitions  we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to make these valuation estimates  which are made based on information available to us at the acquisition date 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
historically  the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and  as a result  we have not disclosed such changes 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management s best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film s opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
the ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a few weeks after the film is released based on the film s initial box office performance  which is determined by a film s initial box office receipts 
as a result  there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable  because we make such estimates based on each film s box office receipts through the end of the reporting period 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life to us of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than forty years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment  etc  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
the majority of our properties were appraised as part of the bankruptcy process described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
such appraisals supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended december   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
with the exception of valuation allowances recorded relative to pre acquisition periods  decreases in the valuation allowance generally result in a decrease in the provision for income taxes 
should we ultimately realize a benefit from tax assets in excess of the amount recorded that relates to pre acquisition periods  goodwill would be reduced to the extent of such excess or recorded goodwill  as appropriate 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation  require judgment by us and may be challenged by the tax authorities 
as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  effective december   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  in accordance with fin  we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position 
with respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate  the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
with the exception of tax benefits realized relative to changes in pre acquisition uncertain tax positions  any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made 
for the fiscal year ended december   our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained  the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate 
a one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million

inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
seasonality the company s revenues are usually seasonal  coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors 
generally  studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and the holiday seasons 
the unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern 
the timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the company s results of operations  and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other quarter 
the seasonality of motion picture exhibition  however  has become less pronounced as studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year
