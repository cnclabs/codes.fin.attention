recent events market dislocation during the second half of  extreme dislocations emerged in the financial markets  including the leveraged finance  subprime mortgage  and commercial paper markets 
these dislocations were further compounded by the decoupling of typical correlations in the various markets in which we do business 
furthermore  in the fourth quarter of  the credit ratings of certain structured securities eg  cdos were downgraded which among other things triggered further widening of credit spreads for these types of securities 
we have been an active participant in the cdo market and maintain ongoing exposure to these securities and have incurred losses associated with these exposures 
for more information regarding capital markets and advisory services cmas results including cdos  leveraged finance and related ongoing exposure  see the cmas discussion beginning on page in addition  the market dislocation impacted the credit ratings of structured investment vehicles sivs in the market place 
gwim manages certain cash funds which have invested in siv transactions 
we have entered into capital commitments to support these funds and have incurred losses associated with these commitments including losses on certain securities purchased earlier from these funds at fair value 
for more information on our cash fund support  see the gwim discussion beginning on page in  we continue to have exposure to those items noted above  and depending upon market conditions  we may experience additional losses 
current business environment the financial conditions mentioned above continue to negatively affect the economy and the financial services sector in the slowdown of the economy  significant decline in consumer real estate prices  and the continued and rapid deterioration in the housing sector have affected our home equity portfolio and will  in all likelihood  impact other areas of our consumer portfolio 
we expect that certain industry sectors  in particular those that are dependent on the housing sector  and certain geographic regions will experience further stress

for more information related to our monoline exposure  see the industry concentrations discussion on page the above conditions together with uncertainty in energy costs and the overall economic slowdown  which may ultimately lead to recessionary conditions  will affect other markets in which we do business and will adversely impact our results in the degree of the impact is dependent upon the duration and severity of the aforementioned conditions in this rapidly changing business and interest rate environment

economic overview in  notwithstanding significant declines in housing  soaring oil prices and tremendous turmoil in financial markets  real gross domestic product gdp grew percent 
growth softened significantly in the fourth quarter 
consumer spending remained resilient  as increases in employment and wages offset the negative influences of declining home prices 
fueled by another year of strong exports and a slowdown in imports  the us trade deficit fell sharply  lifting us domestic production 
however  declines in residential construction subtracted nearly a full percentage point from gdp growth  more than offsetting the boost provided by international trade 
corporate profits declined modestly in the second half of the year from all time record highs 
global economies recorded their fourth consecutive year of rapid expansion  driven by sustained robust growth in china  india and other emerging market economies 
growth in europe and japan moderated in the second half of the year 
higher energy prices pushed up inflation throughout the year 
however  excluding food and energy  core inflation receded in the second half of the year  in lagged response to the deceleration of nominal spending growth 
a sharp rise in defaults on subprime mortgages and worries about the potential fallout from the faltering housing and subprime mortgage markets triggered financial market turbulence beginning in the summer 
a dramatic repricing of credit risk and unprecedented capital losses stemming from sharp declines in the value of structured credit products based on subprime debt deepened the financial crisis 
in response  the frb eased short term interest rates  reduced the discount rate relative to its federal funds rate target and in december created a new facility for auctioning short term funds through the discount window of the federal reserve banks 
the fourth quarter ended on a weak note  as consumer spending moderated  businesses reduced production  employment slowed and the unemployment rate rose

table of contents deposits average deposits increased billion to billion in compared to due to a billion increase in average domestic interest bearing deposits and a billion increase in average foreign interest bearing deposits

core deposits exclude negotiable cds  public funds  other domestic time deposits and foreign interest bearing deposits 
average core deposits increased billion to billion in  a three percent increase from the prior year

table of contents supplemental financial data table provides a reconciliation of the supplemental financial data mentioned below with financial measures defined by gaap 
other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently 
operating basis presentation in managing our business  we may at times look at performance excluding certain nonrecurring items 
for example  as an alternative to net income  we view results on an operating basis  which represents net income excluding merger and restructuring charges 
the operating basis of presentation is not defined by gaap 
we believe that the exclusion of merger and restructuring charges  which represent events outside our normal operations  provides a meaningful year to year comparison and is more reflective of normalized operations 
net interest income fte basis in addition  we view net interest income and related ratios and analysis ie  efficiency ratio  net interest yield and operating leverage on a fte basis 
although this is a non gaap measure  we believe managing the business with net interest income on a fte basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes 
to derive the fte basis  net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax exempt income on an equivalent before tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
for purposes of this calculation  we use the federal statutory tax rate of percent 
this measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
performance measures as mentioned above  certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio  net interest yield and operating leverage utilize net interest income and thus total revenue on a fte basis 
the efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue  and net interest yield evaluates how many basis points we are earning over the cost of funds 
operating leverage measures the total percentage revenue growth minus the total percentage expense growth for the corresponding period 
during our annual integrated planning process  we set operating leverage and efficiency targets for the corporation and each line of business 
we believe the use of these non gaap measures provides additional clarity in assessing our results 
targets vary by year and by business  and are based on a variety of factors including maturity of the business  investment appetite  competitive environment  market factors  and other items eg  risk appetite 
the aforementioned performance measures and ratios  return on average assets and dividend payout ratio  as well as those measures discussed more fully below  are presented in table return on average common shareholders equity and return on average tangible shareholders equity we also evaluate our business based upon roe and rote measures 
roe and rote utilize non gaap allocation methodologies 
roe measures the earnings contribution of a unit as a percentage of the shareholders equity allocated to that unit 
rote measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of shareholders equity reduced by goodwill 
these measures are used to evaluate our use of equity ie  capital at the individual unit level and are integral components in the analytics for resource allocation 
in addition  profitability  relationship  and investment models all use roe as key measures to support our overall growth goal

core net interest income managed basis we manage core net interest income managed basis  which adjusts reported net interest income on a fte basis for the impact of market based activities and certain securitizations  net of retained securities 
as discussed in the gcib business segment section beginning on page  we evaluate our market based results and strategies on a total market based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for cmas 
we also adjust for loans that we originated and subsequently sold into certain securitizations 
these securitizations include off balance sheet loans and leases  primarily credit card securitizations where servicing is retained by the corporation  but excludes first mortgage securitizations 
noninterest income  rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses  is recorded for assets that have been securitized as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and record servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations  where appropriate 
we believe the use of this non gaap presentation provides additional clarity in managing our results 
an analysis of core net interest income managed basis  core average earning assets managed basis and core net interest yield on earning assets managed basis  which adjusts for the impact of these two non core items from reported net interest income on a fte basis  is shown in the table above 
core net interest income on a managed basis increased million in compared to the increase was driven by higher levels of consumer and commercial loans  the impact of the lasalle acquisition  and a one time tax benefit from restructuring our existing non us based commercial aircraft leasing business

certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation 
for more information on our basis of presentation  selected financial information for the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue  net income and period end total asset amounts  see note business segment information to the consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation we prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non gaap methodologies and performance measures  many of which are discussed in supplemental financial data beginning on page we begin by evaluating the operating results of the businesses which by definition excludes merger and restructuring charges 
the segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies which are utilized to determine net income 
the net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics 
the management accounting reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue  expense and capital 
the net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity based costing model  funds transfer pricing  and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business

table of contents our alm activities maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage fluctuations in earnings that are caused by interest rate volatility 
our goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect net interest income 
the results of the business segments will fluctuate based on the performance of corporate alm activities 
some alm activities are recorded in the businesses eg  deposits such as external product pricing decisions  including deposit pricing strategies  as well as the effects of our internal funds transfer pricing process 
the net effects of other alm activities are reported in each of our segments under alm other 
in addition  certain residual impacts of the funds transfer pricing process are retained in all other 
certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments based on pre determined means 
the most significant of these expenses include data processing costs  item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions 
data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage 
item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment 
the costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies which reflect utilization 
equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk adjusted methodology incorporating each unit s credit  market  interest rate and operational risk components 
the corporation as a whole benefits from risk diversification across the different businesses 
this benefit is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment and is recorded in alm other 
the nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page average equity is allocated to the business segments and related businesses  and is impacted by the portion of goodwill that is specifically assigned to the businesses and the unallocated portion of goodwill that resides in alm other

our products include traditional savings accounts  money market savings accounts  cds and iras  and noninterest and interest bearing checking accounts 
debit card results are also included in deposits 
deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity 
we earn net interest spread revenues from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client facing lending activity and our alm activities 
the revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits 
deposits also generate fees such as account service fees  non sufficient fund fees  overdraft charges and atm fees  while debit cards generate merchant interchange fees based on purchase volume

average deposits decreased billion  or one percent  largely due to the migration of customer relationships and related balances to gwim  partially offset by the acquisition of lasalle 
the increase in noninterest income was driven by higher service charges of million  or percent  primarily as a result of new demand deposit account growth and the addition of lasalle

table of contents the corporation reports its gcsbb results  specifically card services  on a managed basis  which is consistent with the way that management evaluates the results of gcsbb 
managed basis assumes that securitized loans were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold ie  held loans are presented 
loan securitization is an alternative funding process that is used by the corporation to diversify funding sources 
loan securitization removes loans from the consolidated balance sheet through the sale of loans to an off balance sheet qspe which is excluded from the corporation s consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
securitized loans continue to be serviced by the business and are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans 
in addition  excess servicing income is exposed to similar credit risk and repricing of interest rates as held loans 
net income decreased billion  or percent  to billion compared to as growth in noninterest income and net interest income was more than offset by higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense 
net interest income increased million  or one percent  to billion as an increase in managed average loans and leases of billion was partially offset by spread compression 
noninterest income increased million  or eight percent  to billion mainly due to higher cash advance fees related to organic loan growth in domestic credit card and unsecured lending 
all other income increased million primarily due to higher foreign revenues 
provision for credit losses increased billion  or percent  to billion compared to the increase was primarily driven by higher managed net losses from portfolio seasoning and increases from unusually low loss levels experienced in post bankruptcy reform 
the higher provision was also driven by reserve increases in our small business portfolio reflective of growth in the business and portfolio deterioration 
in addition  higher provision was due to seasoning of the unsecured lending portfolio 
these increases in provision were partially offset by a higher level of reserve reduction from the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the domestic credit card securitization trust

the increase in mortgage banking income of million  or percent  to billion was primarily due to the election under sfas to account for certain mortgage loans held for sale at fair value  favorable performance of the msrs and increased production income partially offset by widening of credit spreads during the year 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas on january   mortgage loan origination fees and costs are recognized in earnings when incurred

a variety of factors influence results including volume of activity  the degree in which we successfully anticipate market movements  and how our hedges perform in the various markets 
during the second half of  extreme dislocations emerged in the financial markets  including leveraged finance  subprime mortgage  and the commercial paper markets  and these dislocations were further compounded by the decoupling of typical correlations in the various markets in which we participate 
these conditions created less liquidity  a flight to quality  greater volatility  widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency 
furthermore  in the fourth quarter of  the credit ratings of certain structured securities eg  cdos were downgraded which among other things triggered further widening of credit spreads for this type of security 
we have been an active participant in the cdo market  maintain ongoing exposure to these securities and incurred losses associated with these exposures 
many of these conditions continued into and it is unclear how long these conditions and the overall economic slowdown may continue and what impact they will ultimately have on our results 
cmas recognized a net loss of billion in  a decrease of billion  compared to driven by a decrease in market based revenue of billion 
the decrease was driven by billion of losses resulting from our cdo exposure and other trading losses 
partially offsetting this decrease was a reduction in noninterest expense due to lower performance based incentive compensation 
investment banking income increased million to billion due to growth in advisory fees 
this growth was driven by increased market activity primarily in the first half of the year partially offset by reduced debt underwriting fees that were affected by the market disruptions during the second half of the year which included the utilization of fees to distribute leveraged loan commitments 
sales and trading revenue declined billion to a loss of billion in while structured products and credit products reported losses for  liquid products and equities compared reasonably well with given the market conditions 
liquid products revenue decreased million as the negative impact of spread widening and correlations breaking down eg  correlation between certain municipal market indices and bond market swap spreads were partially offset by the strength in interest rate products and foreign exchange contracts 
credit products losses were million  a decline in revenue of billion compared to losses resulted from positions taken in the market as a result of customer market making activities as the widening of spreads during the second half of the year had a negative impact on these positions 
in addition  certain indices became extremely volatile and diverged from other related indices and from single name credit risk bonds  loans or derivatives in our portfolio 
this negatively impacted our hedging of portfolios of single name credits with derivatives based on these indices 
one example of this divergence was the widening of the spread between the investment grade cash and the credit derivative markets 
in addition  losses also resulted from positions taken in the market as the widening of spreads during the second half of the year had a negative impact on these positions 
we also incurred losses of million  net of million of fees  on leveraged loans  loan commitments and the corporation s share of the leveraged forward calendar 
losses incurred on our leveraged exposure were not concentrated in any one type senior secured  covenant light or subordinated senior unsecured and were generally due to wider new issuance credit spreads 
since the negotiated spreads were lower than the then current new issuance spread  a fair value loss bank of america 
table of contents resulted 
in several instances  commitments were either terminated by the client or interest rate concessions eg  an increase in the stated coupon were obtained from the borrowers  thereby increasing the value of the loans  in each case negating the need for any writedown 
at december   the corporation s share of the leveraged finance forward calendar that consisted primarily of senior secured exposure was billion and our funded position held for distribution was billion 
in addition  we had limited investment grade exposure that was in line with our normal exposure levels 
structured products losses were billion  with a decline in revenue of billion in compared to the prior year 
the decrease was driven by billion of losses resulting from our cdo exposure  million of losses on cmbs funded debt and the forward calendar and million related to other structured products 
see the detailed cdo exposure discussion to follow 
other structured products  including residential mortgage backed securities and structured credit trading  were negatively impacted by spread widening due to the credit market disruptions during the second half of the year and by the breakdown of the expected hedge correlations 
for example  the divergence in valuation of agency based mortgage products  principally derivatives and forward sales contracts  used to economically hedge non agency mortgage exposure resulted in losses on our residential mortgage backed securities trading positions 
at the end of the year  we held billion of funded cmbs debt of which billion were floating rate acquisition related financings to major  well known operating companies 
in addition  we had a forward calendar of just over billion of which billion were floating rate acquisition related financings 
equity products revenue decreased million primarily due to lower client activity in equity capital markets and equity derivatives combined with reduced trading results

cdo vehicles issue multiple tranches of debt securities  including commercial paper  mezzanine and equity securities

during  we recorded losses of billion associated with our subprime super senior cdo exposure 
the losses reduced trading account profits losses by approximately billion and other income by approximately million 
in addition  we incurred approximately billion in losses related to subprime sales and trading positions  approximately million related to our cdo warehouse  and approximately million to cover counterparty risk on the insured cdos 
for more information on our super senior liquidity exposure  see the cdo discussion beginning on page our net subprime super senior liquidity commitments were billion where we have recorded losses of billion

the mezzanine exposure is collateralized with about percent of subprime assets of which approximately percent are of higher quality vintages from and prior 
the cdos squared exposure is supported by approximately percent of subprime collateral  the majority of which were later vintages 
our net other subprime super senior exposure was billion where we have recorded losses of billion 
other subprime super senior exposure consists primarily of our cash and derivative positions including the unfunded commitments 
the collateral underlying the high grade exposure is similar to our high grade collateral discussed above 
the mezzanine exposure underlying collateral was heavily weighted to subprime with approximately percent coming from later vintages while the cdos squared collateral was made up of approximately percent subprime assets comprised of later vintages 
we also had net non subprime super senior cdo exposure of billion which primarily included highly rated clo and cmbs super senior exposures 
the net non subprime super senior exposure is comprised of billion of super senior liquidity commitment exposure and million of high grade other super senior exposure 
we recorded losses of million associated with these exposures 
these losses were primarily driven by spread widening rather than impairment of principal 
in addition to the table above  we also had cdo exposure with a market value of approximately million in our cdo warehouse of which million was classified as subprime  and cdo exposure of approximately billion related to our sales and trading activities of which million was classified as subprime 
the subprime exposure related to our cdo warehouse and sales and trading activities is carried at approximately percent of par value 
as mentioned above  during the fourth quarter  the credit ratings of certain cdo structures were downgraded which among other things triggered widening of credit spreads for this type of security 
cdo related markets experienced significant liquidity constraints impacting the availability and reliability of transparent pricing 
we subsequently valued these cdo structures assuming they would terminate and looked through the structures to the underlying net asset values supported by the underlying securities 
we were able to obtain security values using external pricing services for approximately percent of the cdo exposure for which we used the average of all prices obtained by security 
the majority of the remaining positions where no pricing quotes were available were valued using matrix pricing by aligning the value to securities that had similar vintage of underlying assets and ratings  using the lowest rating between the rating services 
the remaining securities were valued using projected cash flows  similar to the valuation of an interest only strip  based on bank of america 
table of contents estimated average life  seniority level and vintage of underlying assets 
we assigned a zero value to the cdo positions for which an event of default had been triggered 
the value of cash held by the trustee for all cdo structures was also incorporated into the resulting net asset value 
at december   we held billion of purchased insurance on our cdo exposure of which percent was provided by monolines in the form of cds  total return swaps trs or financial guarantees 
the majority of this purchased insurance relates to the high grade super senior exposure

we provided support to certain cash funds managed within columbia 
the funds for which we provided support typically invest in high quality  short term securities with a weighted average maturity of days or less  including a limited number of securities issued by sivs 
due to market disruptions  certain siv investments were downgraded by the rating agencies and experienced a decline in fair value

for additional information on our liquidity risk  see liquidity risk and capital management beginning on page these activities utilize spes  typically in the form of corporations  limited liability companies  or trusts  which raise funds by issuing short term commercial paper or similar instruments to third party investors 
these spes typically hold various types of financial assets whose cash flows are the primary source of repayment for the liabilities of the spes 
investors have recourse to the assets in the spe and often benefit from other credit enhancements  such as overcollateralization in the form of excess assets in the spe  liquidity facilities  and other arrangements

prior to the second half of  we believed that the likelihood of our experiencing an economic loss as the result of our obligations under the written put options was remote 
however  due to severe market disruptions during the second half of  the cdos holding the put options began to experience difficulties in issuing commercial paper 
shortly thereafter  a significant portion of the assets held in these cdos were downgraded or threatened with downgrade by the rating agencies 
as a result of these factors  we began to purchase commercial paper that could not be issued to third parties at less than the contractual yield specified in our liquidity obligations 
see note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the written put options

the return on the assets held in the conduits  which consist principally of liquid exchange traded securities and some leveraged loans  is passed through to our customers through a series of derivative contracts 
we consolidate a third conduit which holds subordinated debt securities for our benefit 
these conduits obtain funding through the issuance of commercial paper and subordinated certificates to third party investors

we do not provide sblcs or other forms of credit enhancement to these conduits

table of contents managing risk overview our management governance structure enables us to manage all major aspects of our business through an integrated planning and review process that includes strategic  financial  associate  customer and risk planning 
we derive much of our revenue from managing risk from customer transactions for profit 
in addition to qualitative factors  we utilize quantitative measures to optimize risk and reward trade offs in order to achieve growth targets and financial objectives while reducing the variability of earnings and minimizing unexpected losses 
risk metrics that allow us to measure performance include economic capital targets and corporate risk limits 
by allocating economic capital to a line of business  we effectively manage that business s ability to take on risk 
review and approval of business plans incorporate approval of economic capital allocation  and economic capital usage is monitored through financial and risk reporting 
industry  country  trading  asset allocation and other limits supplement the allocation of economic capital 
these limits are based on an analysis of risk and reward in each line of business and management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits 
our risk management process continually evaluates risk and appropriate metrics needed to measure it 
our business exposes us to the following major risks strategic  liquidity  credit  market and operational risk 
strategic risk is the risk that adverse business decisions  ineffective or inappropriate business plans or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment  business cycles  customer preferences  product obsolescence  execution and or other intrinsic risks of business will impact our ability to meet our objectives 
liquidity risk is the inability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  fund asset growth and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates 
credit risk is the risk of loss arising from a borrower s or counterparty s inability to meet its obligations 
market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions  such as interest rate movements 
operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems or external events 
the following sections  strategic risk management on page  liquidity risk and capital management beginning on page  credit risk management beginning on page  market risk management beginning on page and operational risk management beginning on page  address in more detail the specific procedures  measures and analyses of the major categories of risk that we manage 
risk management processes and methods we have established and continually enhance control processes and use various methods to align risk taking and risk management throughout our organization 
these control processes and methods are designed around three lines of defense lines of business  enterprise functions and corporate audit 
the lines of business are the first line of defense and are responsible for identifying  quantifying  mitigating and monitoring all risks within their lines of business  while certain enterprise wide risks are managed centrally 
for example  except for trading related business activities  interest rate risk associated with our business activities is managed centrally as part of our alm activities 
line of business management makes and executes the business plan and is closest to the changing nature of risks and  therefore  we believe is best able to take actions to manage and mitigate those risks 
our lines of business prepare periodic self assessment reports to identify the status of risk issues  including mitigation plans  if appropriate 
these reports roll up to executive management to ensure appropriate risk management and oversight  and to identify enterprise wide issues 
our management processes  structures and policies aid us in complying with laws and regulations and provide clear lines for decision making and accountability 
wherever practical  we attempt to house decision making authority as close to the transaction as possible while retaining supervisory control functions from both in and outside of the lines of business 
the key elements of the second line of defense are risk management  compliance  finance  global technology and operations  human resources  and legal functions 
these groups are independent of the lines of businesses and are organized on both a line of business and enterprise wide basis 
for example  for risk management  a senior risk executive is assigned to each of the lines of business and is responsible for the oversight of all the risks associated with that line of business 
enterprise level risk executives have responsibility to develop and implement polices and practices to assess and manage enterprise wide credit  market and operational risks 
corporate audit  the third line of defense  provides an independent assessment of our management and internal control systems 
corporate audit activities are designed to provide reasonable assurance that resources are adequately protected  significant financial  managerial and operating information is materially complete  accurate and reliable  and employees actions are in compliance with corporate policies  standards  procedures  and applicable laws and regulations 
we use various methods to manage risks at the line of business levels and corporate wide 
examples of these methods include planning and forecasting  risk committees and forums  limits  models  and hedging strategies 
planning and forecasting facilitates analysis of actual versus planned results and provides an indication of unanticipated risk levels 
generally  risk committees and forums are composed of lines of business  risk management  treasury  compliance  legal and finance personnel  among others  who actively monitor performance against plan  limits  potential issues  and introduction of new products 
limits  the amount of exposure that may be taken in a product  relationship  region or industry  seek to align corporate wide risk goals with those of each line of business and are part of our overall risk management process to help reduce the volatility of market  credit and operational losses 
models are used to estimate market value and net interest income sensitivity  and to estimate expected and unexpected losses for each product and line of business  where appropriate 
hedging strategies are used to manage the risk of borrower or counterparty concentration risk and to manage market risk in the portfolio 
the formal processes used to manage risk represent only one portion of our overall risk management process 
corporate culture and the actions of our associates are also critical to effective risk management 
through our code of ethics  we set a high standard for our associates 
the code of ethics provides a framework for all of our associates to conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of our products or services to our customers 
we instill a risk conscious culture through communications  training  policies  procedures  and organizational roles and responsibilities 
additionally  we continue to strengthen the linkage between the associate performance management process and individual compensation to encourage associates to work toward corporate wide risk goals

strategic risk management strategic risk is the risk that adverse business decisions  ineffective or inappropriate business plans  or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment  business cycles  customer preferences  product obsolescence  execution and or other intrinsic risks of business will impact our ability to meet our objectives 
we use an integrated planning process to help manage strategic risk 
a key component of the planning process aligns strategies  goals  tactics and resources throughout the enterprise 
the process begins with the creation of a corporate wide business plan which incorporates an assessment of the strategic risks 
this business plan establishes the corporate strategic direction 
the planning process then cascades through the lines of business  creating business line plans that are aligned with the corporation s strategic direction 
at each level  tactics and metrics are identified to measure success in achieving goals and assure adherence to the plans 
as part of this process  the lines of business continuously evaluate the impact of changing market and business conditions  and the overall risk in meeting objectives 
see the operational risk management section beginning on page for a further description of this process 
corporate audit in turn monitors  and independently reviews and evaluates  the plans and measurement processes 
one of the key tools we use to manage strategic risk is economic capital allocation 
through the economic capital allocation process  we effectively manage each line of business s ability to take on risk 
review and approval of business plans incorporate approval of economic capital allocation  and economic capital usage is monitored through financial and risk reporting 
economic capital allocation plans for the lines of business are incorporated into the corporation s operating plan that is approved by the board on an annual basis 
liquidity risk and capital management liquidity risk liquidity is the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  fund asset growth and business operations  and meet contractual obligations through unconstrained access to funding at reasonable market rates 
liquidity management involves forecasting funding requirements and maintaining sufficient capacity to meet the needs and accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to changes in our business operations or unanticipated events 
sources of liquidity include deposits and other customer based funding  and wholesale market based funding 
we manage liquidity at two levels 
the first is the liquidity of the parent company  which is the holding company that owns the banking and nonbanking subsidiaries 
the second is the liquidity of the banking subsidiaries 
the management of liquidity at both levels is essential because the parent company and banking subsidiaries have different funding needs and sources  and are subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements 
through alco  the finance committee is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy as well as approving operating and contingency procedures  and monitoring liquidity on an ongoing basis 
corporate treasury is responsible for planning and executing our funding activities and strategy 
in order to ensure adequate liquidity through the full range of potential operating environments and market conditions  we conduct our liquidity management and business activities in a manner that will preserve and enhance funding stability  flexibility and diversity 
key components of this operating strategy include a strong focus on customer based funding  maintaining direct relationships with wholesale market funding providers  and maintaining the ability to liquefy certain assets when  and if  requirements warrant 
we develop and maintain contingency funding plans for both the parent company and bank liquidity positions 
these plans evaluate our liquidity position under various operating circumstances and allow us to ensure that we would be able to operate through a period of stress when access to normal sources of funding is constrained 
the plans project funding requirements during a potential period of stress  specify and quantify sources of liquidity  outline actions and procedures for effectively managing through the problem period  and define roles and responsibilities 
they are reviewed and approved annually by alco 
bank of america 
table of contents our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings 
the credit ratings of bank of america corporation and bank of america  na are reflected in the table below 
table credit ratings december  bank of america corporation bank of america  na senior debt subordinated debt commercial paper short term borrowings long term debt moody s investors service aa aa p p aaa standard poor s aa aa a a aa fitch ratings aa aa f f aa under normal business conditions  primary sources of funding for the parent company include dividends received from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries  and proceeds from the issuance of senior and subordinated debt  as well as commercial paper and equity 
primary uses of funds for the parent company include repayment of maturing debt and commercial paper  share repurchases  dividends paid to shareholders  and subsidiary funding through capital or debt 
the parent company maintains a cushion of excess liquidity that would be sufficient to fully fund the holding company and nonbank affiliate operations for an extended period during which funding from normal sources is disrupted 
the primary measure used to assess the parent company s liquidity is the time to required funding during such a period of liquidity disruption 
this measure assumes that the parent company is unable to generate funds from debt or equity issuance  receives no dividend income from subsidiaries  and no longer pays dividends to shareholders while continuing to meet nondiscretionary uses needed to maintain bank operations and repayment of contractual principal and interest payments owed by the parent company and affiliated companies 
under this scenario  the amount of time the parent company and its nonbank subsidiaries can operate and meet all obligations before the current liquid assets are exhausted is considered the time to required funding 
alco approves the target range set for this metric  in months  and monitors adherence to the target 
maintaining excess parent company cash ensures that time to required funding remains in the target range of to months and is the primary driver of the timing and amount of the corporation s debt issuances 
as of december  time to required funding was months compared to months at december  the reduction reflects the funding of the lasalle acquisition for billion in cash which closed on october  we had anticipated in the fourth quarter of that the time to required funding would decrease slightly below our target range as a result of the funding of the lasalle acquisition 
we anticipate returning to our target range in due in part to the issuance of preferred stock in the first quarter of for additional information on our recent preferred stock issuances  see the preferred stock discussion on page the primary sources of funding for our banking subsidiaries include customer deposits and wholesale market based funding 
primary uses of funds for the banking subsidiaries include growth in the core asset portfolios  including loan demand  and in the alm portfolio 
we use the alm portfolio primarily to manage interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
one ratio that can be used to monitor the stability of funding composition is the loan to domestic deposit ratio 
this ratio reflects the percent of loans and leases that are funded by domestic core deposits  a relatively stable funding source 
a ratio below percent indicates that our loan portfolio is completely funded by domestic core deposits 
the ratio was percent at december  compared to percent at december  the increase was primarily attributable to organic growth in the loan and lease portfolio  and a decision to retain a larger share of mortgage production on the corporation s balance sheet 
the strength of our balance sheet is a result of rigorous financial and risk discipline 
our core deposit base  which is a low cost funding source  is often used to fund the purchase of incremental assets primarily loans and securities  the composition of which impacts our loan to deposit ratio 
mortgage backed securities and mortgage loans have prepayment risk which must be managed 
repricing of deposits is a key variable in this process 
the capital generated in excess of capital adequacy targets and to support business growth  is available for the payment of dividends and share repurchases 
alco determines prudent parameters for wholesale market based borrowing and regularly reviews the funding plan for the bank subsidiaries to ensure compliance with these parameters 
the contingency funding plan for the banking subsidiaries evaluates liquidity over a month period in a variety of business environment scenarios assuming different levels of earnings performance and credit ratings as well as public and investor relations factors 
funding exposure related to our role as liquidity provider to certain off balance sheet financing entities is also measured under a stress scenario 
in this analysis  ratings are downgraded such that the off balance sheet financing entities are not able to issue commercial paper and backup facilities that we provide are drawn upon 
in addition  potential draws on credit facilities to issuers with ratings below a certain level are analyzed to assess potential funding exposure 
we originate loans for retention on our balance sheet and for distribution 
as part of our originate to distribute strategy  commercial loan originations are distributed through syndication structures  and residential mortgages originated by consumer real estate are frequently distributed in the secondary market 
in connection with our balance sheet management activities  we may retain mortgage loans originated as well as purchase and sell loans based on our assessment of market conditions 
regulatory capital at december   the corporation operated its banking activities primarily under three charters bank of america  na  fia card services  na and lasalle bank  na as a regulated financial services company  we are governed by certain regulatory capital requirements

basel ii in june  the basel ii accord was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks 
similar to economic capital measures  basel ii seeks to address credit risk  market risk and operational risk 
while economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses  the corporation also maintains a certain threshold in terms of regulatory capital to adhere to legal standards of capital adequacy 
these thresholds or leverage ratios will continue to be utilized for the foreseeable future 
on december   the us regulatory agencies published the final basel ii rules basel ii rules 
the basel ii rules establish requirements for the us implementation and provide detailed capital requirements for credit and operational risk under pillar  supervisory requirements under pillar and disclosure requirements under pillar we are still awaiting final rules for market risk requirements under basel ii 
the basel ii rules allow us financial institutions to begin parallel reporting as early as during the parallel period  the resulting capital calculations under both the current basel i rules and the basel ii rules should be reported to the financial institutions regulatory supervisors for examination and compliance for at least four consecutive quarterly periods 
once the parallel period and subsequent three year transition period are successfully completed  the financial institution will utilize basel ii as their means of capital adequacy assessment  measurement and reporting and discontinue use of basel i 
we continue execution efforts to ensure preparedness with all basel ii requirements 
the goal is to achieve full compliance by the end of the three year implementation period in further  internationally basel ii was implemented in several countries during the second half of  while others will begin implementation in and bank of america

credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations 
credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance  commitment or investment of funds 
we define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases  derivatives  trading account assets  assets held for sale  deposit overdrafts and unfunded lending commitments that include loan commitments  letters of credit and financial guarantees 
derivative positions  trading account assets and assets held for sale are recorded at fair value  or the lower of cost or fair value 
loans and unfunded commitments  which the corporation elected to account for at fair value in accordance with sfas  are also recorded at fair value 
credit risk for these categories of assets is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustment recorded in earnings in the period incurred 
for derivative positions  our credit risk is measured as the net replacement cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in a gain position to us fail to perform under the terms of those contracts 
we use the current mark to market value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark to market changes 
the credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral 
our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures take into account funded and unfunded credit exposures 
for additional information on derivatives and credit extension commitments  see note derivatives and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements 
for credit risk purposes  we evaluate our consumer businesses on both a held and managed basis 
managed basis assumes that loans that have been securitized were not sold and presents earnings on these loans in a manner similar to the way loans that have not been sold ie  held loans are presented 
we evaluate credit performance on a managed basis as the receivables that have been securitized are subject to the same underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring as held loans 
in addition to the discussion of credit quality statistics of both held and managed loans included in this section  refer to the card services discussion beginning on page for additional information on our managed portfolio and securitizations  see note securitizations to the consolidated financial statements 
we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty  repayment sources  the nature of underlying collateral  and other support given current events  conditions and expectations 
we classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below 
the financial market conditions that existed in the second half of have continued to affect the economy and the financial services sector in it remains unclear what impact the housing downturn  declines in real estate values and the overall economic slowdown will ultimately have and how long these conditions will exist 
we expect that certain industry sectors  in particular those that are dependent on the housing sector  and certain geographic regions  will experience further stress 
continued deterioration of the housing market  including recessionary conditions  will negatively impact the credit quality of our consumer portfolio as well as the credit quality of the consumer dependent sectors of our commercial portfolio and will result in a higher provision for credit losses in future periods 
the degree of the impact will be dependent upon the duration and severity of the housing downturn 
as part of our credit risk management culture  we continually evaluate our credit standards and adjust them to be consistent with changes in the environment 
for exam bank of america 
table of contents ple  we have adjusted our underwriting criteria  as well as enhanced our line management and collection strategies across the consumer businesses 
in the commercial businesses  we have increased the frequency of portfolio monitoring and are aggressively managing exposure when we begin to see signs of deterioration 
consumer portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower s credit cycle 
statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting  product pricing  risk appetite  setting credit limits  operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns 
in addition  credit decisions are statistically based with tolerances set to decrease the percentage of approvals as the risk profile increases 
statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and or internal historical experience 
these models are a critical component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in the determination of both new and existing credit decisions  portfolio management strategies including authorizations and line management  collection practices and strategies  determination of the allowance for credit losses  and economic capital allocations for credit risk 
for information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies  nonperforming status and charge offs for the consumer portfolio  see note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements 
management of consumer credit risk concentrations consumer credit risk is evaluated and managed with a goal that credit concentrations do not result in undesirable levels of risk 
we review  measure and manage credit exposure in numerous ways such as by product and geography in order to achieve the desired mix 
additionally  to enhance our overall risk management strategy credit protection is purchased on certain portions of our portfolio 
our consumer loan portfolio in the states of california  florida  new york and texas represented in aggregate percent and percent of total managed consumer loans at december  and our consumer loan portfolio in the state of california represented approximately percent and percent of total managed consumer loans at december  and  primarily driven by the consumer real estate portfolio 
our consumer loan portfolio in the state of florida is our second largest concentration and represented approximately eight percent of total managed consumer loans at both december  and  primarily driven by the consumer real estate portfolio 
new york and texas represented six percent and five percent of total managed consumer loans at both december  and no state other than california  and no single metropolitan statistical area msa within california represented more than percent of the total managed consumer portfolio 
no other single state represented over five percent of total managed consumer loans 
we have mitigated a portion of our credit risk in our residential mortgage loan portfolio by using synthetic securitizations 
these agreements are cash collateralized and will reimburse us in the event that losses exceed established loss levels 
as of december  and  approximately billion and billion of mortgage loans were protected by these agreements 
in addition  we have entered into credit protection agreements with government sponsored agencies on approximately billion and billion as of december  and  providing full protection on conforming residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent 
our regulatory risk weighted assets were reduced as a result of these transactions because we transferred a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties 
at december  and  these transactions had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk weighted assets by billion and billion  and resulted in increases of bps and bps in our tier capital ratio at december  and bank of america

due to current market conditions  members of the mortgage servicing industry are evaluating a number of programs for identifying subprime residential mortgage loan borrowers who are at risk of default and offering loss mitigation strategies  including repayment plans and loan modifications  to such borrowers 
generally these programs require that the borrower and subprime residential mortgage loan meet certain criteria in order to qualify for a modification 
the sec s office of the chief accountant oca noted that if certain loan modification requirements are met  the oca will not object to continued status of the transferee as a qspe under sfas we do not currently originate or service significant subprime residential mortgage loans  nor do we hold a significant amount of beneficial interests in qspe securitizations of subprime residential mortgage loans

table of contents sop sop addresses accounting for differences between contractual cash flows and cash flows expected to be collected from an investor s initial investment in loans acquired in a transfer if those differences are attributable  at least in part  to credit quality 
sop requires that impaired loans be recorded at fair value and prohibits carrying over or the creation of valuation allowances in the initial accounting of loans acquired in a transfer that are within the scope of this sop categories of loans for which it is probable  at the time of acquisition  that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement will not be collected 
the prohibition of the valuation allowance carryover applies to the purchase of an individual loan  a pool of loans  a group of loans  and loans acquired in a purchase business combination 
in accordance with sop  certain acquired loans of lasalle in and mbna in that were considered impaired were written down to fair value at the acquisition date 
therefore  reported net charge offs and managed net losses were lower since these impaired loans that would have been charged off during the period were reduced to fair value as of the acquisition date 
sop does not apply to the acquired loans that have been securitized as they are not held on the corporation s balance sheet

commercial portfolio credit risk management credit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of their financial position 
as part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower or counterparty  most of our commercial credit exposure or transactions are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition  cash flow or financial situation of a borrower or counterparty 
we use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios 
risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of assigned economic capital and the allowance for credit losses 
in making credit decisions  we consider risk rating  collateral  country  industry and single name concentration limits while also balancing the total borrower or counterparty relationship 
our lines of business and risk management personnel use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations 
for information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies  nonperforming status and charge offs for the commercial portfolio  see note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements 
management of commercial credit risk concentrations portfolio credit risk is evaluated and managed with a goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk 
we review  measure  and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry  product  geography and customer relationship 
distribution of loans and leases by loan size is an additional measure of the portfolio risk diversification 
we also review  measure  and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type 
in addition  within our international portfolio  we evaluate borrowings by region and by country 
tables   and summarize our concentrations 
additionally  we utilize syndication of exposure to third parties  loan sales  hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the loan portfolio 
bank of america 
table of contents from the perspective of portfolio risk management  customer concentration management is most relevant in gcib 
within that segment s business lending and cmas businesses  we facilitate bridge financing high grade debt  high yield debt  cmbs and equity to fund acquisitions  recapitalizations and other short term needs as well as provide syndicated financing for our clients 
these concentrations are managed in part through our established originate to distribute strategy 
these client transactions are sometimes large and leveraged 
they can also have a higher degree of risk as we are providing offers or commitments for various components of the clients capital structures  including lower rated unsecured and subordinated debt tranches and or equity 
in many cases  these offers to finance will not be accepted 
if accepted  these conditional commitments are often retired prior to or shortly following funding via the placement of securities  syndication or the client s decision to terminate 
where we have a binding commitment and there is a market disruption or other unexpected event  there may be heightened exposure in the portfolios and forward calendar  and a higher potential for writedown or loss unless the terms of the commitment can be modified and or an orderly disposition of the exposure can be made 
the corporation s share of the leveraged finance and cmbs forward calendars were billion and billion  respectively  at december  funded leveraged finance and cmbs exposure included in assets held for sale totaled billion and billion at december  the funded cmbs exposure includes amounts assumed with the acquisition of lasalle 
the funded cmbs debt consisted of billion of floating rate acquisition related financings to major  well known operating companies 
in addition  of the cmbs forward calendar  billion were floating rate acquisition related financings 
writedowns were taken on both funded and forward calendar commitments to reflect the current market prices  if available  or the estimated price at which the exposures could be distributed in the market 
in the first quarter of the leveraged finance markets began to experience disruptions similar to those experienced in the second half of and it is unclear what impact these conditions will have on our results 
prior to january   the corporation accounted for all loans in the held to maturity portfolio on a historical cost basis and incurred losses on this portfolio were charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
effective january   the corporation elected to account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes  which exceed the corporation s single name credit risk concentration guidelines at fair value in accordance with sfas the corporation initially adopted the fair value option for billion of outstanding commercial loans as of january  and recorded pre tax net losses of million net of adjustments related to the allowance for loan and lease losses and direct loan origination fees and costs representing the excess of carrying value over fair value of the funded loans  with the after tax amount recorded in retained earnings 
the corporation also initially adopted the fair value option for billion of unfunded commercial commitments  including letters of credit  as of january   and recorded pre tax net losses of million net of associated adjustments related to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments representing the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the unfunded lending commitments  with the after tax amount recorded in retained earnings 
after the initial application of sfas  any fair value adjustment upon origination and subsequent changes in the fair value of loans and unfunded commitments is recorded in other income 
by including the credit risk of the borrower in the fair value adjustments  any credit deterioration or improvement is recorded immediately as part of the fair value adjustment 
as a result  the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments are no longer used to capture credit losses inherent in these nonperforming or impaired loans and unfunded commitments 
the remaining commercial credit portfolio tables have been modified to exclude loans and unfunded commitments that are carried at fair value and to adjust certain ratios for this accounting change 
see note fair value disclosures to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption of sfas at december   outstanding commercial loans measured at fair value had an aggregate fair value of billion recorded in loans and leases and included commercial domestic loans of billion  commercial foreign loans of million and commercial real estate loans of million

the loans and leases net charge off ratio increased to percent from percent a year ago

since december   our net credit default protection purchased has been reduced by billion to billion as we continue to reposition the level of purchased protection based on our current view of the underlying credit risk in the portfolio 
at december  and  we had net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio of billion and billion 
the net mark to market impacts  including the cost of credit default protection  resulted in net gains of million in compared to net losses of million in the average var for these credit derivative hedges was million and million for the twelve months ended december  and the decrease in var was driven by a reduction in the average amount of credit protection outstanding during the year 
there is a diversification effect between the credit derivative hedges and the market based trading portfolio such that their combined average var was million and million for the twelve months ended december  and refer to the trading risk management discussion beginning on page for a description of our var calculation for the market based trading portfolio

provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses increased billion  or percent  to billion in compared to the consumer portion of the provision for credit losses increased billion to billion compared to higher net charge offs from portfolio seasoning  reflective of growth in the businesses and increases from the unusually low charge off levels experienced in post bankruptcy reform drove a portion of the increase 
additionally  reserve increases related to higher losses inherent in our home equity portfolio  reflecting growth in the business and the impact of the weak housing market  as well as seasoning of the card services consumer portfolios contributed to the increased provision expense 
the increases were partially offset by reserve reductions from the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the domestic credit card securitization trust and to a lesser extent  improved performance of the remaining portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we have previously exited 
the commercial portion of the provision for credit losses increased billion to billion compared to higher net charge offs from seasoning and deterioration in our small business portfolios within gcsbb as well as a lower level of commercial recoveries in gcib and gwim drove a portion of the increase 
reserve increases for seasoning of growth and deterioration in the small business portfolio within gcsbb  the absence of prior year reserve releases in gcib and portfolio deterioration reflecting the impact of the weak housing market  particularly on our homebuilder loan portfolio within gcib  also drove the year over year increase 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction of reserves in all other reflecting the sale of our argentina portfolio during the first quarter of the provision for credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments was million in compared to million in allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans measured at fair value in accordance with sfas as subsequent mark to market adjustments related to loans measured at fair value include a credit risk component 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is allocated based on two components 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the combined total of these two components 
the first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers those commercial loans measured at historical cost that are either nonperforming or impaired 
an allowance is allocated when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price are lower than the carrying value of that loan 
for purposes of computing the specific loss component of the allowance  larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical loss experience for the respective product type and risk rating of the loans 
the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers performing consumer and commercial loans and leases measured at historical cost 
the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience by internal risk rating  current economic conditions  industry performance trends  geographic or obligor concentrations within each portfolio segment  and any other pertinent information 
the commercial historical loss experience is updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflective of the current economic environment 
as of december   quarterly updating of historical loss experience did not have a material impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations  generally by product type 
loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including  but not limited to  historical loss experience  estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends  delinquencies  economic trends and credit scores 
these loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis in order to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment 
as of december   quarterly updating of the loss forecast models resulted in increases in the allowance for loan and lease losses primarily due to growth and seasoning of the consumer portfolios and higher inherent losses in the home equity and small business portfolios 
included within this second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses and determined separately from the procedures outlined above are reserves which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect our estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty and large single name defaults 
we monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses 
this monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio as presented in table was billion at december   an increase of billion from december  the increase was attributable to an increase in reserves during for higher losses inherent in our home equity portfolio reflective of the impact of the weak housing market as well as growth and seasoning of the card services consumer portfolios 
these increases were partially offset by reserve reductions from the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the domestic credit card securitizations trust  net new issuances of securitizations  and improved performance of the remaining portfolios from certain consumer finance businesses that we have previously exited 
the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses was billion at december   a billion increase from december  the lasalle acquisition increased the allowance for commercial loan and lease losses million 
in addition  the increase in commercial domestic allowance levels was primarily attributable to an increase in reserves for higher losses inherent in the small business portfolio within gcsbb 
commercial real estate allowance levels increased mainly due to the lasalle acquisition and portfolio deterioration reflecting the impact of the weak housing market  particularly on our homebuilder loan portfolio within gcib 
commercial foreign allowance levels decreased due to the sales of our latin american portfolios and operations 
bank of america 
table of contents the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was percent at december   compared to percent at december  the increase in the ratio was driven by reserve increases for higher inherent losses in the small business and home equity portfolios within gcsbb  reflecting growth of these businesses and deterioration in the portfolios  and seasoning of the card services unsecured lending portfolio as well as discontinuing sales of new receivables into the unsecured lending trust 
these increases were partially offset by growth in the residential mortgage portfolio  which has a low loss profile  as the corporation increased retention of residential mortgage loans for alm purposes 
also offsetting the increases were reserve reductions related to the addition of higher loss profile accounts to the domestic credit card securitization trust and the sales of our latin american portfolios and operations 
reserve for unfunded lending commitments in addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses  we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments measured at historical cost  such as letters of credit and financial guarantees  and binding unfunded loan commitments 
unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans  except utilization assumptions are considered 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet with changes to the reserve generally made through the provision for credit losses 
the reserve for unfunded lending commitments at december  was million  a million increase from december  primarily driven by the acquisition of lasalle

this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities including loans  deposits  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities  and derivatives 
market sensitive assets and liabilities are generated through loans and deposits associated with our traditional banking business  customer and proprietary trading operations  alm process  credit risk mitigation activities and mortgage banking activities 
in the event of market volatility  factors such as underlying market movements and liquidity have an impact on the results of the corporation 
our traditional banking loan and deposit products are nontrading positions and are reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities historical cost 
gaap requires a historical cost view of traditional banking assets and liabilities 
however  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions  primarily changes in the levels of interest rates 
the risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our nontrading positions is managed through our alm activities 
we have elected to fair value certain loan and deposit products in accordance with sfas for further information on fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities  see note fair value disclosures to the consolidated financial statements 
our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes currently reflected in income 
trading positions are subject to various risk factors  which include exposures to interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as well as mortgage  equity  commodity  issuer and market liquidity risk factors 
we seek to mitigate these risk exposures by using techniques that encompass a variety of financial instruments in both the cash and derivatives markets 
the following discusses the key risk components along with respective risk mitigation techniques 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates 
these instruments include  but are not limited to  loans  debt securities  certain trading related assets and liabilities  deposits  borrowings and derivative instruments 
hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include related derivatives such as options  futures  forwards and swaps 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies 
the types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries  foreign currency denominated loans and securities  future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions  foreign currency denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options  currency swaps  futures  forwards and deposits 
mortgage risk mortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the value of mortgage related instruments 
the values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates  mortgage rates  agency debt ratings  default  market liquidity  other interest rates and interest rate volatility 
our exposure to these instruments takes several forms 
first  we trade and engage in market making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans  pass through certificates  commercial mortgages  and collateralized mortgage obligations including cdos using mortgages as underlying collateral 
second  we originate a variety of mortgage backed securities which involves the accumulation of mortgage related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization 
third  we may hold positions in mortgage secu bank of america 
table of contents rities and residential mortgage loans as part of the alm portfolio 
fourth  we create msrs as part of our mortgage origination activities 
see note summary of significant accounting principles and note mortgage servicing rights to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on msrs 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options  futures  forwards  swaps  swaptions and securities 
equity market risk equity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity linked instruments 
instruments that would lead to this exposure include  but are not limited to  the following common stock  exchange traded funds  american depositary receipts adrs  convertible bonds  listed equity options puts and calls  over the counter equity options  equity total return swaps  equity index futures and other equity derivative products 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options  futures  swaps  convertible bonds and cash positions 
commodity risk commodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum  natural gas  power  and metals markets 
these instruments consist primarily of futures  forwards  swaps and options 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options  futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product  as well as cash positions 
issuer credit risk issuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers 
our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads  by credit migration  or by defaults 
hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds  cds and other credit fixed income instruments 
market liquidity risk market liquidity risk represents the risk that expected market activity changes dramatically and in certain cases may even cease to exist 
this exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact in an orderly manner and may impact our results 
this impact could further be exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are impacted by the disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments 
we utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in trading risk management 
trading risk management trading related revenues represent the amount earned from trading positions  including market based net interest income  which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets 
trading account assets and liabilities and derivative positions are reported at fair value 
for more information on fair value  see note fair value disclosures to the consolidated financial statements and complex accounting estimates beginning on page trading related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand 
trading related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions  the level of risk assumed  and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever changing market environment 
the grc  chaired by the global markets risk executive  has been designated by alco as the primary governance authority for global markets risk management including trading risk management 
the grc s focus is to take a forward looking view of the primary credit and market risks impacting cmas and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy 
at the grc meetings  the committee considers significant daily revenues and losses by business along with an explanation of the primary driver of the revenue or loss 
thresholds are established for each of our businesses in order to determine if the revenue or loss is considered to be significant for that business 
if any of the thresholds are exceeded  an explanation of the variance is made to the grc 
the thresholds are developed in coordination with the respective risk managers to highlight those revenues or losses which exceed what is considered to be normal daily income statement volatility 
bank of america 
table of contents logo the histogram of daily revenue or loss above is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading related revenue for the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   positive trading related revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days 
during the second half of  cdo related markets experienced significant liquidity constraints impacting the availability and reliability of transparent pricing resulting in the valuation of cdos becoming more complex and time consuming 
accordingly  it was not possible to mark these positions to market on a daily basis 
as a result  we recorded valuation adjustments in trading account profits losses of approximately billion on certain discrete dates relating to our super senior cdo exposure 
for further discussion of our super senior cdo exposure and related losses see page excluding the discrete writedowns on our super senior cdo exposure  percent of the total trading days had losses greater than million  and the largest loss was million 
this can be compared to the twelve months ended december   where positive trading related revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days and there were no losses greater than million  and the largest loss was million 
the increase in the total trading days with losses greater than million was due to the period of market disruption during the second half of to evaluate risk in our trading activities  we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios 
var is a key statistic used to measure market risk 
in order to manage day to day risks  var is subject to trading limits both for our overall trading portfolio and within individual businesses 
all limit excesses are communicated to management for review 
a var model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses 
the var represents the worst loss the portfolio is expected to experience based on historical trends with a given level of confidence 
var depends on the volatility of the positions in the portfolio and on how strongly their risks are correlated 
within any var model  there are sig nificant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company 
in addition  the accuracy of a var model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the positions in the portfolio 
a var model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products which do not have extensive historical price data  or for illiquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available 
our var model uses a historical simulation approach based on three years of historical data and assumes a percent confidence level 
statistically  this means that losses will exceed var  on average  one out of trading days  or two to three times each year 
a var model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios 
there are however many limitations inherent in a var model as it utilizes historical results over a defined time period to estimate future performance 
historical results may not always be indicative of future results and changes in market conditions or in the composition of the underlying portfolio could have a material impact on the accuracy of the var model 
this was of particular relevance in the last part of when markets experienced a period of extreme illiquidity resulting in losses that were far outside of the normal loss forecasts by var models 
due to these limitations  we have historically used the var model as only one of the components in managing our trading risk and also use other techniques such as stress testing and desk level limits 
periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to various degrees 
see discussion on stress testing on the following page 
on a quarterly basis  the accuracy of the var methodology is reviewed by backtesting ie  comparing actual results against expectations derived from historical data the var results against the daily profit and loss 
graphic representation of the backtesting results with additional explanation of backtesting excesses are reported to the grc 
backtesting excesses occur when trading losses exceed the var 
senior management reviews and evaluates the results of these tests

table of contents logo the graph above shows daily trading related revenue and var excluding the discrete writedowns on our super senior cdo exposure for the twelve months ended december  excluding these writedowns  actual losses exceeded daily trading var fourteen times in the twelve months ended december  and losses did not exceed daily trading var in the twelve months ended december  the losses that exceeded daily trading var for the twelve months ended december   occurred during the market disruption which took place during the second half of the sudden increase in market volatility during this period produced a large number of price changes that exceeded the th percentile of the three year history used for our var calculations 
table presents average  high and low daily trading var for the twelve months ended december  and the increase in average var from was driven by the increased market volatility during the second half of in particular  with the dislocation in structured and credit products  many credit spreads used in the calculation of var increased by unprecedented amounts 
in addition  many trading assets became extremely illiquid which required changes in assumptions to properly incorporate them in the var model as was the case with our cdo exposure for which we have updated our model at various times during the second half of in periods of stress  the grc members communicate daily to discuss losses  var limit excesses and the impact to regulatory capital 
as a result of this process  the lines of business may selectively reduce risk 
where economically feasible  positions are sold or macro economic hedges are executed to reduce the exposure 
stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates  we also stress test our portfolio 
stress testing estimates the value change in our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements 
various types of stress tests are run regularly against the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses 
historical scenarios simulate the impact of price changes which occurred during a set of extended historical market events 
the results of these scenarios are reported daily to management

table of contents hypothetical scenarios evaluate the potential impact of extreme but plausible events over periods as long as one month 
these scenarios are developed to address perceived vulnerabilities in the market and in our portfolios  and are periodically updated 
they are also reviewed and updated to reflect changing market conditions  such as were experienced during the second half of for example  many trading assets became extremely illiquid which required changes in assumptions to properly incorporate them in the stress models 
this was the case with our cdo related exposure for which we have updated our models at various times during the second half of management reviews and evaluates results of these scenarios monthly 
during the twelve months ended december   the largest daily losses among these scenarios ranged from million to billion 
worst case losses  which represent the most extreme losses in our daily var calculation  are reported daily 
finally  desk level stress tests are performed daily for individual businesses 
these stress tests evaluate the potential adverse impact of large moves in the market risk factors to which those businesses are most sensitive 
interest rate risk management for nontrading activities interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our nontrading exposures 
our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not adversely affect core net interest income managed basis 
interest rate risk is measured as the potential volatility in our core net interest income managed basis caused by changes in market interest rates 
client facing activities  primarily lending and deposit taking  create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet 
interest rate risk from these activities  as well as the impact of changing market conditions  is managed through our alm activities 
simulations are used to estimate the impact on core net interest income managed basis using numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations evaluate how the above mentioned scenarios impact core net interest income managed basis on short term financial instruments  debt securities  loans  deposits  borrowings  and derivative instruments 
in addition  these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
these simulations do not include the impact of hedge ineffectiveness 
management analyzes core net interest income managed basis forecasts utilizing different rate scenarios  with the base case utilizing the forward interest rates 
management frequently updates the core net interest income managed basis forecast for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends and market conditions 
thus  we continually monitor our balance sheet position in an effort to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes 
we prepare forward looking forecasts of core net interest income managed basis 
these baseline forecasts take into consideration expected future business growth  alm positioning  and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by forward interest rates 
we then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have to these static baseline forecasts in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions 
the spot and month forward monthly rates used in our respective baseline forecasts at december  and are shown in table table reflects the pre tax dollar impact to forecasted core net interest income managed basis over the next twelve months from december  and  resulting from a bp gradual parallel increase  a bp gradual parallel decrease  a bp gradual curve flattening increase in short term rates or decrease in long term rates and a bp gradual curve steepening decrease in short term rates or increase in long term rates from the forward market curve 
for further discussion of core net interest income managed basis see page the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shifts over the indicated years 
the estimated exposure is reported on a managed basis and reflects impacts that may be realized primarily in net interest income and card income 
this sensitivity analysis excludes any impact that could occur in the valuation of retained interests in the corporation s securitizations due to changes in interest rate levels

table of contents our core net interest income managed basis  was liability sensitive at both december  and at december   our core net interest income managed basis became more liability sensitive as we positioned ourselves for greater downside risk than was reflected in the forward curve 
we evaluate our balance sheet position on an ongoing basis 
since december   we have repositioned our balance sheet to a more modest level given changes in forward rates and we will continue to evaluate our balance sheet positioning going forward 
over a month horizon  we would benefit from falling rates or a steepening of the yield curve beyond what is already implied in the forward market curve 
as part of our alm activities  we use securities  residential mortgages  and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity 
securities the securities portfolio is an integral part of our alm position 
the securities portfolio is primarily comprised of debt securities and includes mortgage backed securities and to a lesser extent corporate  municipal and other investment grade debt securities 
during and  we purchased afs debt securities of billion and billion  sold billion and billion  and had maturities and received paydowns of billion and billion 
we realized million in gains and million in losses on sales of debt securities during and additionally  during  we acquired billion of afs debt securities as part of the lasalle and us trust corporation acquisitions and continue to evaluate the appropriate holding levels 
the value of our accumulated oci loss related to afs debt securities improved by a pre tax amount of billion during  driven by a decrease in interest rates 
for those securities that are in an unrealized loss position we have the intent and ability to hold these securities to recovery 
accumulated oci includes billion in after tax gains at december   related to unrealized gains associated with our afs securities portfolio  including billion of unrealized losses related to afs debt securities and billion of unrealized gains related to afs marketable equity securities 
total market value of the afs debt securities was billion at december  with a weighted average duration of years and primarily relates to our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
prospective changes to the accumulated oci amounts for the afs securities portfolio will be driven by further interest rate  credit or price fluctuations including market value fluctuations associated with our ccb investment  the collection of cash flows including prepayment and maturity activity  and the passage of time 
during the fourth quarter of  shares of the corporation s strategic investment in ccb are now accounted for as afs marketable equity securities and are carried at a fair value of billion 
the unrealized gain on this investment of billion net of tax is subject to currency and price fluctuation  and is recorded in accumulated oci 
in connection with adopting sfas  the corporation reclassified approximately billion from afs debt securities to trading account assets during the first quarter of there were no net unrealized gains or losses associated with these securities recorded in accumulated oci as these securities were hedged using sfas hedge accounting 
accordingly  there was no impact on the corporation s transition adjustment to beginning retained earnings upon adoption of sfas on january  residential mortgage portfolio during and  we purchased billion and billion of residential mortgages related to alm activities  and added billion and billion of originated residential mortgages 
we sold billion and billion of residential mortgages during and  which included billion and billion of originated residential mortgages  resulting in gains of million and million 
additionally  we received paydowns of billion and billion during and the ending balance at december  was billion compared to billion at december  interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our alm activities and serve as an efficient tool to mitigate our interest rate and foreign exchange risk 
we use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components 
for additional information on our hedging activities  see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements 
our interest rate contracts are generally non leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps  options  futures  and forwards 
in addition  we use foreign exchange contracts  including cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward contracts  to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  as well as certain equity investments in foreign subsidiaries

the decisions to reposition our derivative portfolio are based upon the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate environment  balance sheet composition and trends  and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions 
our interest rate swap positions including foreign exchange contracts changed to a net receive fixed position of billion on december  compared to a net receive fixed position of billion on december  changes in the notional levels of our interest rate swap position were driven by the net termination of billion in pay fixed swaps  the net termination of billion in us dollar denominated receive fixed swaps  and the addition of billion in foreign denominated receive fixed swaps 
the notional amount of our foreign exchange basis swaps increased billion to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the notional amount of our option position decreased billion to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the decrease in the notional amount of options was due to the net terminations and expirations of billion in caps and floors and terminations of billion of swaptions

the table above includes derivatives utilized in our alm activities  including those designated as sfas accounting hedges and economic hedges 
the fair value of net alm contracts increased billion from a gain of billion at december  to a gain of billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to gains from changes in the value of foreign exchange basis swaps of billion  and us dollar denominated receive fixed interest rate swaps of billion 
these gains were partially offset by losses from changes in the value of pay fixed interest rate swaps of million  option products of million  and foreign exchange contracts of million 
the increase in the value of foreign exchange basis swaps was due to the strengthening of most foreign currencies against the us dollar during the twelve months ended december  the increase in the value of us dollar denominated receive fixed interest rate swaps and the decrease in the value of the pay fixed interest rate swaps were due to decreases in interest rates during the decrease in the value of the option portfolio was primarily attributable to decreases in interest rates during  net terminations and expirations of caps and floors  and terminations of swaptions 
the decrease in the value of foreign exchange contracts was largely due to the increase in foreign interest rates during the corporation uses interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities  and other forecasted transactions cash flow hedges 
from time to time  the corporation also utilizes equity indexed derivatives accounted for as sfas cash flow hedges to minimize exposure to price fluctuations on the forecasted purchase or sale of certain equity investments 
the net losses on both open and terminated derivative instruments recorded in accumulated oci  net of tax  was billion at december  these net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period when the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows

mortgage banking risk management irlcs and the related residential first mortgage loans held for sale are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the irlc and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market 
to hedge interest rate risk  we utilize forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments including purchased options 
these instruments are used as economic hedges of irlcs and residential first mortgage loans held for sale 
at december   the notional amount of derivatives economically hedging the irlcs and residential first mortgage loans held for sale was billion 
the corporation adopted sfas as of january  and elected to account for certain originated mortgage loans held for sale at fair value 
subsequent to the adoption  mortgage loan origination costs are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred 
previously  mortgage loan origination costs would have been capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the loans and recognized as a reduction of mortgage banking income upon the sale of such loans 
at december   residential mortgage loans held for sale in connection with mortgage banking activities for which the fair value option was elected had an aggregate fair value of billion and an aggregate outstanding principal balance of billion 
net gains resulting from changes in fair value of loans held for sale that we originated  including realized gains and losses on sale of million  were recorded in mortgage banking income during the adoption of sfas resulted in an increase of million in mortgage banking income during  and in an increase of million in noninterest expense during we manage changes in the value of msrs by entering into derivative financial instruments 
msrs are a nonfinancial asset created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan 
we use certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps as economic hedges of msrs

operational risk management operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  including system conversions and integration  and external events 
successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature  volume and complexity of the financial services business 
we approach operational risk from two perspectives corporate wide and line of business specific 
the compliance and operational risk committee provides oversight of significant corporate wide operational and compliance issues 
within global risk management  enterprise operational risk management develops policies  practices  controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the corporation 
we also mitigate operational risk through a broad based approach to process management and process improvement 
improvement efforts are focused on reduction of variation in outputs 
we have a dedicated quality and productivity team to manage and certify the process management and improvement efforts 
for selected risks  we use specialized support groups  such as information security and supply chain management  to develop corporate wide risk management practices  such as an information security program and a supplier program to ensure that suppliers adopt appropriate policies and procedures when performing work on behalf of the corporation 
these specialized groups also assist the lines of business in the development and implementation of risk management practices specific to the needs of the individual businesses 
these groups also work with line of business executives and risk executives to develop appropriate policies  practices  controls and monitoring tools for each line of business 
through training and communication efforts  compliance and operational risk awareness is driven across the corporation 
the lines of business are responsible for all the risks within the business line  including operational risks 
operational and compliance risk executives  working in conjunction with senior line of business executives  have developed key tools to help identify  measure  mitigate and monitor operational risk in each business line 
examples of these include personnel management practices  data reconciliation processes  fraud management units  transaction processing monitoring and analysis  business recovery planning and new product introduction processes 
in addition  the lines of business are responsible for monitoring adherence to corporate practices 
line of business management uses a self assessment process  which helps to identify and evaluate the status of risk and control issues  including mitigation plans  as appropriate 
the goal of the self assessment process is to periodically assess changing market and business conditions  to evaluate key operational risks impacting each line of business  and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks 
in addition to information gathered from the self assessment process  key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to help identify trends and issues on both a corporate and a line of business level 
recent accounting and reporting developments see note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
complex accounting estimates our significant accounting principles  as described in note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements  are essential in understanding the md a 
many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate values of assets and liabilities 
we have procedures and processes to facilitate making these judgments 
the more judgmental estimates are summarized below 
we have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation process that  with the exception of accrued taxes  involve mathematical models to derive the estimates 
in many cases  there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the model 
where alternatives exist  we bank of america 
table of contents have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs 
actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact net income 
separate from the possible future impact to net income from input and model variables  the value of our lending portfolio and market sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet measurement  often significantly  due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions 
such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant  negative effect on future operating results 
these fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses  which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments  represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the corporation s lending activities that are carried at historical cost 
changes to the allowance for credit losses are reported in the consolidated statement of income in the provision for credit losses 
our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in the credit risk management section beginning on page and note summary of significant accounting principles to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions made in this process  estimates of the portfolio s inherent risks and overall collectibility change with changes in the economy  individual industries  countries and individual borrowers or counterparties ability and willingness to repay their obligations 
the degree to which any particular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses depends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the other assumptions 
key judgments used in determining the allowance for credit losses include i risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and leases  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii product type classifications for consumer and commercial loans and leases  iv loss rates used for consumer and commercial loans and leases  v adjustments made to assess current events and conditions  vi considerations regarding domestic and global economic uncertainty  and vii overall credit conditions 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk rating assigned to commercial loans and leases 
assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk rating for commercial loans and leases measured at historical cost and rated under the internal risk rating scale  except loans and leases already risk rated doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities  the allowance for loans and lease losses would increase by approximately billion at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases measured at historical cost at december  was percent and this hypothetical increase in the allowance would raise the ratio to approximately percent 
our allowance for loans and lease losses is also sensitive to the loss rates used for the consumer and commercial portfolios 
a percent increase in the loss rates used on the consumer and commercial loan and lease portfolios measured at historical cost would increase the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  by approximately million  of which million would relate to consumer and million to commercial 
these sensitivity analyses do not represent management s expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of a downgrade of one level of the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases within a short period of time is remote 
the process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment 
it is possible that others  given the same information  may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions 
fair value of financial instruments effective january   we determined the fair market values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
the standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
we carry certain corporate loans and loan commitments  loans held for sale  structured reverse repurchase agreements  and long term deposits at fair value in accordance with sfas we also carry trading account assets and liabilities  derivative assets and liabilities  afs debt and marketable equity securities  msrs  and certain other assets at fair value 
for more information  see note summary of significant accounting principles and note fair value disclosures to the consolidated financial statements 
trading account assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value  which is primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions 
liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair value of trading account assets or liabilities 
market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions  or positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased 
situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market s perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector 
in these instances  fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors  principally from reviewing the issuer s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies 
at december   billion  or two percent  of trading account assets were classified as level fair value assets 
no trading account liabilities were classified as level liabilities at december  the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity  counterparty credit quality and other deal specific factors  where appropriate 
to ensure the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities  various processes and controls have been adopted  which include a model validation policy that requires a review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing  financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification  a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations  and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products 
these processes and controls are performed independently of the business 
the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the over the counter market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates  prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors  which are used to value the position 
the predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources  including brokers  market transactions and third party pricing services 
estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available or are unobservable  in which case bank of america 
table of contents quantitative based extrapolations of rate  price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values 
at december   the level fair values of derivative assets and liabilities determined by these quantitative models were billion and billion 
these amounts reflect the full fair value of the derivatives and do not isolate the discrete value associated with the subjective valuation variable 
further  they represent two percent of both derivative assets and liabilities  before the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements 
for  there were no changes to the quantitative models  or uses of such models  that resulted in a material adjustment to the consolidated statement of income 
trading account profits losses  which represent the net amount earned from our trading positions  can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand 
trading account profits losses are dependent on the volume and type of transactions  the level of risk assumed  and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever changing market environment 
to evaluate risk in our trading activities  we focus on the actual and potential volatility of individual positions as well as portfolios 
at a portfolio and corporate level  we use trading limits  stress testing and tools such as var modeling  which estimates a potential daily loss which is not expected to be exceeded with a specified confidence level  to measure and manage market risk 
at december   the amount of our var was million based on a percent confidence level 
for more information on var  see trading risk management beginning on page afs debt and marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value  which is generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets 
principal investing principal investing is included within equity investments in all other and is discussed in more detail beginning on page principal investing is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies at all stages of their life cycle  from start up to buyout 
these investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund 
some of these companies may need access to additional cash to support their long term business models 
market conditions and company performance may impact whether funding is available from private investors or the capital markets 
for more information  see note summary of significant accounting principles and note fair value disclosures to the consolidated financial statements 
investments with active market quotes are carried at estimated fair value  however  the majority of our investments do not have publicly available price quotations and  therefore  the fair value is unobservable 
at december   we had nonpublic investments of billion  or approximately percent of the total portfolio 
valuation of these investments requires significant management judgment 
we value such investments initially at transaction price and adjust valuations when evidence is available to support such adjustments 
such evidence includes transactions in similar instruments  market comparables  completed or pending third party transactions in the underlying investment or comparable entities  subsequent rounds of financing  recapitalizations and other transactions across the capital structure  and changes in financial ratios or cash flows 
investments are adjusted to estimated fair values at the balance sheet date with changes being recorded in equity investment income in the consolidated statement of income 
accrued income taxes as more fully described in note summary of significant accounting principles and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements  we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas as interpreted by fin accrued income taxes  reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  represents the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date 
we currently file income tax returns in more than jurisdictions and consider many factors including statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction 
in applying the principles of sfas  we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities 
these revisions of our estimate of accrued income taxes  which also may result from our own income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax controversies  may be material to our operating results for any given period 
goodwill and intangible assets the nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets is discussed in detail in note summary of significant accounting principles and note goodwill and intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  or in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
the reporting units utilized for this test were those that are one level below the business segments identified on page the impairment test is performed in two steps 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step must be performed 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  as defined in sfas  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
an impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from it 
an intangible asset subject to amortization shall be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset  indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded to the extent the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
the fair values of the reporting units were determined using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the income approach and the market approach and the fair values of the intangible assets were determined using the income approach 
for purposes of the income approach  discounted cash flows were calculated by taking the net present value of estimated cash flows using a combination of historical results  estimated future cash flows and an appropriate price to earnings multiple 
we use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results 
cash flows were discounted using a discount rate based on expected equity return rates  which was percent for expected rates of equity returns were estimated based on historical market returns and risk return rates for similar industries of bank of america 
table of contents the reporting unit 
for purposes of the market approach  valuations of reporting units were based on actual comparable market transactions and market earnings multiples for similar industries of the reporting unit 
our evaluations for indicated there was no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets 
consolidation and accounting for variable interest entities under the provisions of fin r  a vie is consolidated by the entity that will absorb a majority of the variability created by the assets of the vie 
the calculation of variability is based on an analysis of projected probability weighted cash flows based on the design of the particular vie 
scenarios in which expected cash flows are less than or greater than the expected outcomes create expected losses or expected residual returns 
the entity that will absorb a majority of expected variability the sum of the absolute values of the expected losses and expected residual returns consolidates the vie and is referred to as the primary beneficiary 
a variety of qualitative and quantitative assumptions are used to estimate projected cash flows and the relative probability of each potential outcome  and to determine which parties will absorb expected losses and expected residual returns 
critical assumptions  which may include projected credit losses and interest rates  are independently verified against market observable data where possible 
where market observable data is not available  the results of the analysis become more subjective 
as certain events occur  we re evaluate which parties will absorb variability and whether we have become or are no longer the primary beneficiary 
reconsideration events may occur when vies acquire additional assets  issue new variable interests or enter into new or modified contractual arrangements 
a reconsideration event may also occur when we acquire new or additional interests in a vie 
in the unlikely event we were required to consolidate our unconsolidated vies  their consolidation would increase our assets and liabilities and could have an adverse impact on our tier capital  total capital and tier leverage capital ratios
