item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations in this report 

table of contents our net loss would be increased and our assets would be reduced if we are required to record impairment of our intangible assets 
intangible assets include the excess purchase price over the cost of net assets acquired  or goodwill 
goodwill arose from our september acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of our predecessor  leapfrog rbt  and our acquisition of substantially all the assets of explore technologies in july our intangible assets had a net balance of million  million december  and  respectively  which are allocated to our us consumer segment 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
in determining the existence of impairment  we consider changes in our strategy and in market conditions and this could result in adjustments to our recorded asset balances 
specifically  we would be required to record impairment if the carrying values of our intangible assets exceed their estimated fair values 
such impairment recognition would decrease the carrying value of intangible assets and increase our net loss 
at december  and  we had million of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we tested our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fourth quarter by comparing their carrying values to their estimated fair values 
as a result of this assessment  we determined that no adjustments were necessary to the stated values 
we are subject to international  federal  state and local laws and regulations that could impose additional costs or changes on the conduct of our business 
we operate in a highly regulated environment with international  federal  state and local governmental entities regulating many aspects of our business  including products and the importation of products 
regulations with which we must comply include accounting standards  taxation requirements including changes in applicable income tax rates  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations  trade restrictions  regulations regarding financial matters  environmental regulations  advertising directed toward children  safety and other administrative and regulatory restrictions 
compliance with these and other laws and regulations could impose additional costs on the conduct of our business 
while we take steps that we believe are necessary to comply with these laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that we have achieved compliance or that we will be in compliance in the future 
failure to comply with the relevant regulations could result in monetary liabilities and other sanctions  which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  changes in laws or regulations may lead to increased costs  changes in our effective tax rate  or the interruption of normal business operations that would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation  arbitration or regulatory matters where the outcome is uncertain and which could entail significant expense 
we are subject from time to time to regulatory investigations  litigation and arbitration disputes 
as the outcome of these matters is difficult to predict  it is possible that the outcomes of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on the business 
for more information regarding litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies legal proceedings in this report 
weak economic conditions  armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  labor strikes or public health issues could have a material adverse effect on our business 
weak economic conditions in the united states or abroad as a result of lower consumer spending  lower consumer confidence  higher inflation  higher commodity prices  such as the price of oil  higher costs of capital  restricted capital availability or constrained credit due to the subprime market distress  political conditions  natural disaster  labor strikes or other factors could negatively impact our sales or profitability 
in particular  if an economic recession were to occur  it would likely have a more pronounced impact on discretionary spending for products such as ours 
furthermore  armed hostilities  terrorism  natural disasters  or public health issues  whether in the united states or abroad could cause damage and disruption to our company  our suppliers  our 
table of contents manufacturers  or our customers or could create political or economic instability  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
although it is impossible to predict the consequences of any such events  they could result in a decrease in demand for our product or create delay or inefficiencies in our supply chain by making it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products to our customers  or for our manufacturers to deliver products to us  or suppliers to provide component parts 
notably  our us distribution centers  including our distribution center in fontana  california  and our corporate headquarters are located in california near major earthquake faults that have experienced earthquakes in the past 
in addition to the factors noted above  our existing earthquake insurance relating to our distribution center may be insufficient and does not cover any of our other operations 
if we are unable to maintain the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by the sarbanes oxley act 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december  and december  the assessment as of december  and  concluded that these controls were effective 
for more information  see item a controls and procedures in this report on our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
we received an unqualified opinion from our external auditors on our financial statements for the years ended december  and areas of our internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at any time in the future  or if our external auditors are unable to express an opinion that our internal control over financial reporting is effective  investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could result in the decrease of the market price of our class a common stock 
one stockholder controls a majority of our voting power as well as the composition of our board of directors 
holders of our class a common stock will not be able to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote 
our class a common stock entitles its holders to one vote per share  and our class b common stock entitles its holders to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders 
as of december   lawrence j 
ellison and entities controlled by him beneficially owned approximately million shares of our class b common stock  which represents approximately of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock 
as a result  mr 
ellison controls all stockholder voting power  including with respect to the composition of our board of directors and  through it  any determination with respect to our business direction and policies  including the appointment and removal of officers  any determinations with respect to mergers  other business combinations  or changes in control  our acquisition or disposition of assets  our financing activities  and payment of dividends on our capital stock  subject to the limitations imposed by our credit facility 
mr 
ellison could have interests that diverge from those of our other stockholders 
this control by mr 
ellison could depress the market price of our class a common stock  deter  delay or prevent a change in control of leapfrog  or affect other significant corporate transactions that otherwise might be viewed as beneficial for other stockholders 

table of contents the limited voting rights of our class a common stock could negatively affect its attractiveness to investors and its liquidity and  as a result  its market value 
the holders of our class a and class b common stock generally have identical rights  except that holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share on all matters to be voted on by stockholders 
the holders of our class b common stock have various additional voting rights  including the right to approve the issuance of any additional shares of class b common stock and any amendment of our certificate of incorporation that adversely affects the rights of our class b common stock 
the difference in the voting rights of our class a common stock and class b common stock could diminish the value of our class a common stock to the extent that investors or any potential future purchasers of our class a common stock attribute value to the superior voting or other rights of our class b common stock 
provisions in our charter documents  delaware law and our credit facility agreement may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the value of our class a common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include limitations on actions by our stockholders by written consent  requirements for advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations  and the voting power associated with our class b common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used by our board of directors to affect a rights plan or poison pill that could dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer and may have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of our company 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding voting stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if an offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  under the terms of our credit agreement  we may need to seek the written consent of our lenders of the acquisition of our company 
our stockholders may experience significant additional dilution upon the exercise of options or issuance of stock awards 
as of december   there were outstanding awards under our equity incentive plans that could result in the issuance of approximately million shares of class a common stock 
to the extent we issue shares upon the exercise of any options or vesting of any other equity incentive awards  investors in our class a common stock will experience additional dilution 
our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value 
all the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public markets regarding new products  product enhancements or product recalls by us or our competitors or any other material announcements could affect our stock price 
speculation in the media and analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock and market trends unrelated to our stock can cause the price of our stock to change 
a significant drop in the price of our stock could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business update our strategic review of our business  which began in july  has led to significant changes in our operations designed to reestablish us as a growing  profitable and innovative organization 
we believe our strategic plan will be achieved in three phases  which we describe as fix  reload and grow fix  reload  grow the fix portion of our strategy focused on addressing issues such as product cost  sku mix  product pipeline and leapfrog and retailer inventory 
we believe that the substantial portion of the fix phase is behind us 
our work in represented the majority of the reload portion of our strategy  which focused on strengthening our product pipeline 
our current product development initiatives are focused on developing successor products for the leappad line in preparation for the season  significant enhancements to our successful leapster product line  improvements to our learning toys  and new launches in the grade school arena 
in we developed extensive changes and additions to our product portfolio set for launch in this new product portfolio includes many introductions such as the tag reading system  leapster handheld  didj handheld and crammer handheld 
each of these products provides a better strategic fit with our plan to become more web connected  as well as providing key linkages in our new paradigm of the leapfrog learning path 
these new products are also expected to meet our financial hurdle rates  provide higher margins and contribute to our goal of an improved bottom line 
perhaps most importantly  these new products are intended to grow our sales and thus begins what we refer to as the growth phase of our strategy 
most notably  in we will be introducing the tag reading system  new educational gaming offerings with the leapster and didj handheld learning systems  a strong library of content for our platforms and the leapfrog learning path  all of which are described in item business in this report 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and reported disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for accounts receivable  inventory valuation  the valuation of deferred tax assets and tax liabilities  intangible assets and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on complex and subjective judgments often resulting from our evaluation of the impact of events and conditions that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies in this report 
certain accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are the most significant in affecting judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  product returns  defective products  discounts and promotions we principally derive revenue from sales of our technology based learning products and related proprietary content for education of infant through grade school children at home and in schools 
we evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue when products are shipped and title passes to the customer provided that there is evidence of a commercial arrangement evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products must be present in order to recognize revenue 
delivery has occurred delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped  the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer and no significant post delivery obligations exist 
for online downloads  delivery is considered to occur when the download occurs 
for professional training services  delivery is considered to occur when the training has been performed 
there is a fixed or determinable fee if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
for gift certificates  we recognize revenues when the certificates are redeemed 
collection is reasonably assured collection is reasonably assured if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we recognize revenue upon cash collection 
net sales represent gross sales less negotiated price allowances based primarily on volume purchasing levels  estimated returns  allowances for defective products  markdowns and other sales allowances for customer promotions 
a small portion of our revenue related to subscriptions is recognized as revenue over the period of the subscription 
we reduce accounts receivable by an allowance for amounts we believe may become uncollectible 
determining the amounts that may become uncollectible requires judgment that may have a significant effect on the amounts reported in accounts receivable 
this allowance is an estimate based primarily on our management s evaluation of the customer s financial condition in the context of current economic conditions  past collection history and aging of the accounts receivable balances 
if changes in the economic climate or the financial condition of any of our customers result in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we disclose accounts receivable net of our allowances for doubtful accounts on the face of the balance sheet 
we provide estimated allowances against revenues and accounts receivable for product returns  defective products  chargebacks  discounts and promotions on product sales  in the same period that we record the related revenue 
we estimate our allowances by utilizing historical information for existing products 
for new products  we estimate our allowances for product returns on specific terms for product returns and our experience with similar products 
we also take into account current inventory levels of our retailers  sell through of our retailers and distributors  current trends in retail for our products  changes in customer demand for our products and other related factors 
we continually evaluate our historical experience and adjust our allowances as appropriate 
these adjustments result in changes in our net sales and accounts receivable 
if actual product returns or defective products were significantly greater than our estimated allowances  additional allowances would be required  thereby reducing reported net sales and accounts receivable 
if actual product returns or defective products were significantly less than our estimated allowances  an adjustment increasing reported net sales and accounts receivable would be required 
allowances for product returns  defective products  chargebacks  discounts and promotions on product sales as a reduction of accounts receivable totaled million  million and million at december  
table of contents  and  respectively 
the company engaged in reduced promotional activities in the fourth quarter of as compared to prior years 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market value 
inventory valuation primarily requires estimation of slow moving  obsolete or excess products 
accordingly  inventories included write downs for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories of million and million at december   and  respectively 
our estimate of the write down for slow moving  excess and obsolete inventories is based on our management s review of on hand inventories compared to their estimated future usage  our product demand forecast  anticipated product selling prices  the expected product lifecycle  and products planned for discontinuation 
if actual future usage  demand for our products and anticipated product selling prices were less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs would be required resulting in a negative impact on our gross margin 
we monitor the estimates of inventory write downs on a quarterly basis 
when considered necessary  we make additional adjustments to reduce inventory to its net realizable value  with corresponding increases to cost of goods sold 
the lower write down for excess and obsolescence in as compared to reflects the progress we have made in reducing inventories of older products  especially the leappad line of products and other legacy products that are being replaced or phased out 
intangible assets intangible assets principally include the excess purchase price over the cost of net assets acquired  or goodwill 
goodwill arose from our acquisition of substantially all the assets and business of our predecessor  leapfrog rbt  and our acquisition of substantially all the assets of explore technologies in our intangible assets had a net balance of million and million at december  and  respectively  and are allocated to our us reporting unit  or us consumer segment  pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
a two step approach is required to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit 
the first step tests for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology  which requires significant judgment to estimate the future cash flows  determine the appropriate discount rates  growth rates and other assumptions 
we tested our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment during the fourth quarter and determined that no adjustments were necessary to the stated values 
at december  and  we had million of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets with other than indefinite lives include patents  trademarks and licenses  one of which is a ten year technology license agreement entered into in january to jointly develop and customize our optical scanning technology 
at december  and  we had million of intangible assets with other than indefinite lives 
we recognized an insignificant amount of impairment in the years ended december   and for intangible assets with other than indefinite lives 
the determination of estimated useful lives and whether the intangible assets are impaired involves assumptions and significant judgment 
management makes various assumptions about the future value of intangible assets by evaluating future business forecasts and estimated cash flows 
future net cash flows primarily depend on the sale of our products 

table of contents the sales of our products are affected by our ability to accurately predict the level of demand for them 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product launch schedules 
if we have sales shortfalls  we may not realize the future net cash flows essential to recover the carrying value of our intangible assets 
accordingly  future impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 
therefore  the potential for a write down of intangible assets in connection with the annual impairment test exists 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the measurement and recognition provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas effective january   we adopted the recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based compensation sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost in included the portion vesting in the period for all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested  as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the total grant date fair value is recognized over the vesting period of the options on a straight line basis 
the weighted average assumptions for the expected life and the expected stock price volatility used in the model require the exercise of judgment 
the expected life of the options represent the period of time the options are expected to be outstanding and is currently based on the guidance provided in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
on share based payment as we do not have sufficient historical data on exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on a consideration of our stock s historical and implied volatilities as well as consideration volatilities of other public entities within our industry 
the risk free interest rate used in the model is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant and has a term equal to the expected life 
restricted stock awards and restricted stock units are payable in shares of our class a common stock 
the fair value of each restricted stock or unit is equal to the closing market price of our stock on the trading day immediately prior to the date of grant 
the grant date fair value is recognized in income over the vesting period of these stock based awards  which is generally four years 
stock based compensation arrangements to non employees are accounted for using a fair value approach 
the compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to re measurement over the vesting terms 
we calculate employee stock based compensation expense based on awards ultimately expected to vest and accordingly  the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we review forfeitures periodically and we adjust compensation expense  if considered necessary 
stock based compensation expense may be significantly affected by changes in our stock price  our assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rates as well as the extent of future grants of equity awards 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
in determining our income tax assets  liabilities and expense  we make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax benefits  tax credits and deductions 
significant changes in these estimates may result in increases or decreases in the tax provision or benefit in subsequent periods 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 

table of contents valuation allowances are provided when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  we take into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
our financial statements also include accruals for the estimated amounts of probable future assessments that may result from the examination of federal  state or international tax returns 
our tax accruals  tax provision  deferred tax assets or income tax liabilities may be adjusted if there are changes in circumstances  such as changes in tax law  tax audits or other factors  which may cause management to revise its estimates 
the amounts ultimately paid on any future assessments may differ from the amounts accrued and may result in an increase or reduction to the effective tax rate in the year of resolution

factors driving this decline were a significant sales reduction in our markets managed by distributors  driven primarily by high retailer and distributor inventory levels at the end of  which reduced the demand for products in the sales decline in the united kingdom was driven primarily by a significant decline in sales of our leappad products 
sales fell in our canadian market due to lower sales of fly fusion products in compared to sales of earlier generation fly products in and  to a lesser extent  leappad products 
these factors were partially offset by higher sales in france in compared to  due primarily to strong sales of leapster products

net interest income interest expense plus interest income declined by million from million in to million in this decline was primarily due to the recognition of million of impairment in our short term investment holdings 
as of december   we had available for sale investments in auction rate securities ars with a carrying value of million 
due to the uncertainty and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets  the auctions of our ars holdings have failed and the fair value of these investments has fallen 
as a result  we recorded a million other than temporary impairment charge on million of original cost ars against earnings and a million temporary impairment charge on million of original cost ars against other comprehensive income to reduce the carrying value of the ars to their estimated fair value 
the recent uncertainties in the credit markets have prevented us and other investors from liquidating the holdings of auction rate securities in recent auctions for these securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
accordingly  we still hold these auction rate securities and are receiving interest at a higher rate than similar securities for which auctions have cleared 
these investments are insured against loss of principal and interest and have credit ratings of aaa to aa 
we are uncertain as to when the liquidity issues relating to these investments will improve 
the carrying value of our investments in ars as of december  represents our best estimate of the fair value of these investments based on currently available information 
we evaluated the estimated fair value at january  and concluded that the estimated fair value at that date was indicative of circumstances that existed at the balance sheet date 
as a result  the estimated fair value calculated at january  was determined to be the carrying value as of december  the estimation process included consideration of such factors as issuer and insurer credit rating  comparable market data  if available  credit enhancement structures  projected yields  discount rates and terminal periods 
due to the uncertainty in the credit markets  it is reasonably possible the fair value of these investments may change in the near term 
if the credit markets recover and successful auctions resume  we may be able to recover an amount greater than the carrying value of the ars as of december   which would result in a gain 
however  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to further adjust the carrying value of its investment in ars through additional impairment charges 
we cannot estimate these future losses or gains at this time 
other income expense  net  includes losses on fixed asset sales and various intercompany charges 
tax rate our effective tax rate for was  compared to in the negative tax rate for both years was due to a non cash valuation allowance recorded against our domestic deferred tax assets

seasonality and quarterly results of operations our business is highly seasonal  with our retail customers making a large percentage of all purchases in preparation for the traditional holiday season 
our business  being subject to these significant seasonal fluctuations  generally realizes the majority of our net sales and all of our net income  if any  during the third and fourth calendar quarters 
these seasonal purchasing patterns and production lead times cause risk to our business associated with the under production of popular items and over production of items that do not match consumer demand 
in addition  we have seen our customers managing their inventories more stringently  requiring us to ship products closer to the time they expect to sell to consumers  increasing our risk to meet the demand for specific products at peak demand times  or adversely impacting our own inventory levels as a result of the need to pre build products to meet the demand 
for more information  see item a 
risk factors our business is seasonal  and therefore our annual operating results depend  in large part  on sales relating to the brief holiday season and if we do not maintain sufficient inventory levels or if we are unable to deliver our product to our customers in sufficient quantities  or on a timely basis  or if our retailer s inventory levels are too high  our operating results will be adversely affected
