item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this document contains forward looking statements and information that are based on the beliefs of management as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to level communications  inc and its subsidiaries level or the company 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  believe  plan  estimate and expect and similar expressions  as they relate to the company or its management  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements reflect the current views of the company with respect to future events and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those described in this document 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
level communications  inc  through its operating subsidiaries  is primarily engaged in the communications business  with additional operations in coal mining 
communication services the company is a facilities based provider of a broad range of communications services 
revenue for communications services is recognized on a monthly basis as these services are provided 
for contracts involving private line  wavelengths and dark fiber services  level may receive up front payments for services to be delivered for a period of up to years 
in these situations  level defers the revenue and amortizes it on a straight line basis to earnings over the term of the contract 
at december   for contracts where up front payments were received for services to be delivered in the future  the company s weighted average remaining contract period was approximately years 
the company separates its communications services into three separate categories core communications services  other communications services  and sbc contract services 
each category of revenue is in a different phase of the service life cycle  requiring different levels of investment and focus and providing different contributions to the company s communications adjusted ebitda 
management of level believes that growth in revenue from its core communications services is critical to the long term success of its communications business 
at the same time  the company believes it must continue to manage effectively the positive cash flows from its sbc contract services and its other communications services  including the company s mature managed modem business and its related reciprocal compensation 
for  the core communications services category included revenue from transport and infrastructure  ip and data services  voice and level vyvx video and advertising distribution services 
the other communications services category includes revenue from managed modem and related reciprocal compensation and the legacy managed ip service business 
the sbc contract services category includes all the revenue related to the sbc master services agreement  which was included in the acquisition of wiltel communications group  llc wiltel 
the company s transport and infrastructure services include metropolitan and intercity wavelengths  private line  ethernet private line  dark fiber  colocation services  professional services and transoceanic services 
growth in transport and infrastructure revenue is largely dependent on increased demand for bandwidth services and available capital of companies requiring communications capacity for their own use or in providing capacity as a service provider to their customers 
these expenditures may be in the form of up front payments or monthly payments for primarily private line  wavelength or dark fiber services 
an increase in demand may be partially offset by declines in unit pricing 
ip and data services primarily include the company s high speed internet access service  dedicated internet access dia service  atm and frame relay services  ip and ethernet virtual private network vpn services  and content delivery network cdn services  which includes streaming services 
level s high speed internet access service is a high quality and high speed internet access service offered in a variety of capacities 
the company s vpn services permit businesses of any size to replace multiple networks with a single  cost effective solution that greatly simplifies the converged transmission of voice  video  and data 
this convergence to a single platform can be obtained without sacrificing the quality of service or security levels of traditional atm and frame relay offerings 
vpn services also permit customers to prioritize network application traffic so that high priority applications  such as voice and video  are not compromised in performance by the flow of low priority applications such as email 
the company believes that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for the company s core communications services will be from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet 
revenue growth in this area is dependent on the continued increase in usage by both enterprises and consumers and the pricing environment 
an increase in the reliability and security of information transmitted over the internet and declines in the cost to transmit data have resulted in increased utilization of e commerce or web based services by businesses 
this market is currently characterized by significant price compression and very high levels of unit growth rates  resulting in growth in absolute revenue 
the company experienced price compression in the high speed ip market of over in and expects that its pricing for high speed ip services will continue to decline in at similar rates 
the company continues to experience pricing pressure for those transport and infrastructure customers that require simple  low quality  point to point services  as certain competitors aggressively pursued this business 
however  level believes that competitors are less willing to discount these services if it requires investment in incremental capacity to meet the customer s requirements 
for those customers that provide high quality content or require a combination of transport  ip and voice solutions on a regional or national platform  level is seeing moderate price compression and  in some cases  prices are increasing 
the company offers voice services that target large and existing markets 
the revenue potential for voice services is large  however  the revenue and margins are expected to continue to decline over time as a result of the new low cost ip and optical based technologies 
in addition  the market for voice services is being targeted by many competitors  several of which are larger and have more financial resources than the company 
the company  through its level vyvx business  provides audio and video programming for its customers over the company s fiber optic network and via satellite 
it uses the company s fiber optic network to carry live traditional broadcast and cable television events from the site of the event to the network control centers of the broadcasters of the event 
for live events where the location is not known in advance  such as breaking news stories in remote locations  the company provides an integrated satellite and fiber optic network based service to transmit the content to its customers 
most of level s vyvx s customers for these services contract for the service on an event by event basis  however  there are some customers who have purchased a dedicated point to point service which enables these customers to transmit programming at any time 
level vyvx also distributes advertising spots to radio and television stations throughout the us  both electronically and in physical form 
customers for these services can utilize a network based method for aggregating  managing  storing and distributing content for content owners and rights holders 
on december   level announced that it had reached a definitive agreement to sell the advertising distribution business of vyvx  llc vyvx ads to dg fastchannel  inc for million in cash 
the sale is expected to close in the second quarter of revenue from the vyvx ads business totaled approximately million  million and less than million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the results of operations for the vyvx ads business are included in continuing operations from when it was acquired as part of the wiltel transaction in december the pending disposal of the vyvx ads business does not meet the criteria under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
for presentation as discontinued operations since the business is not considered an asset group as defined in sfas no 
the company expects to continue to develop its content distribution services through the acquisition of the content delivery network cdn services business the cdn business which it purchased on january  from savvis  inc for approximately million in cash including transaction costs and the acquisition of dublin  ireland based servecast limited  which it purchased on july   for approximately million in cash including transaction costs 
the company believes that the addition of the cdn business with its strong  broad portfolio of patents will help the company secure its commercial efforts in the heavily patented cdn market in which a number of competitors have significant  patented intellectual property 
in early we embarked on a strategy to refine our capabilities to address the communications needs of those organizations that produce the content that individuals want to view over the internet 
this service offering includes high speed ip services  colocation services and services that cost effectively distribute the content that is produced for consumption over the internet 
we believe that one of the largest sources of future incremental demand for communications services will be derived from customers that are seeking to distribute their feature rich content or video over the internet 
the company s other communications services are mature services that are not areas of emphasis for the company 
other communications services currently include managed modem  related reciprocal compensation and legacy managed ip services 
the company and its customers continue to see consumers migrate from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services as the narrow band market matures 
additionally  america online  a primary consumer of the company s dial up services  has been implementing a strategic change in its approach to its dial up internet access business over the past months that has accelerated the loss of its dial up subscribers 
during  america online s strategy accelerated the decline in level managed modem revenue and is expected to contribute to further declines in managed modem revenue in the company recognized approximately million of managed modem revenue in  an approximate decline from the million of managed modem revenue recognized in the declines in managed modem revenue from america online in have been offset to some extent by an increase in market share as a result of certain competitors exiting segments of this business in the second half of and the full year level believes that the low cost structure of its network will enable it to compete aggressively for new business in the declining  but still significant  managed modem market 
level receives compensation from other carriers when it terminates traffic originating on those carriers networks 
this reciprocal compensation is based on interconnection agreements with the respective carriers or rates mandated by the fcc 
the company earns the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from providing managed modem services 
the company also began to receive increasing amounts of reciprocal compensation from its voice services during legacy managed ip services primarily include low speed services over atm technology and frame technology  as well as managed security services 
the company s legacy internet access business consists primarily of a business that was acquired in the genuity transaction in to date  the company has elected not to pursue additional customers and to limit the capital invested in this component of its business 
the sbc master services agreement was an agreement between sbc services inc and wiltel sbc contract services agreement and was obtained in the wiltel acquisition 
sbc services inc became a subsidiary of at t inc  together sbc 
wiltel and sbc amended their agreement in june to run through the company recognized million of revenue under the sbc contract services agreement during the agreement provides a gross margin purchase commitment of million from december through the end of  and million from january through the end of and stipulates that originating and terminating access charges paid to local phone companies get passed through to sbc in accordance with a formula that approximates costs and do not count against the gross margin purchase commitment 
sbc fully satisfied the million gross margin purchase commitment during the third quarter of as a result of satisfying the initial gross margin purchase commitment  sbc s purchases of services that exceed the original million gross margin purchase commitment now count toward the million gross margin purchase commitment for the period from january through the end of as of december   sbc had satisfied million of the million gross margin purchase commitment 
level expects that based on sbc s current level of spending  sbc will satisfy the remaining million of gross margin purchase commitment in the first half of additionally  the sbc contract services agreement provides for the payment of million from sbc if certain performance criteria are met by level the company met the required performance criteria and recorded annual revenue of million in both and under the agreement 
of the annual amounts  was based on monthly performance criteria and the remaining was based on performance criteria for the full years 
the performance based incentive provisions of the agreement ended on december  level will not earn performance based incentives in under the sbc contract services agreement 
as a result of the reductions in sbc contract services revenue and the overall increase in revenue from acquisition activity  concentration of revenue among a limited number of customers has decreased compared to previous periods 
level s top ten customers  including the sbc contract services revenue  represented of total communications revenue in the first quarter of  dropping to of total communications revenue in the fourth quarter of excluding the sbc contract services revenue  level s top ten customers represented of total communications revenue in the first quarter of  dropping to of total communications revenue in the fourth quarter of the company expects the concentration of revenue from its top ten customers to continue to decline moderately in as the sbc contract services revenue continues to decline 
however  if level would lose one or more major customers  or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for level services  the company s communications business would be materially and adversely affected 
level s management continues to review all of the company s existing lines of business and service offerings to determine how those lines of business and service offerings assist with the company s focus on the delivery of communications services and meeting its financial objectives 
to the extent that certain lines of business  business segments or service offerings are not considered to be compatible with the delivery of the company s services or with obtaining financial objectives  level may exit those lines of business segments or stop offering those services 
the company is focusing its attention on the following operational objectives growing revenue in core communications services  continuing to show improvements in adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenue  achieving sustainable generation of free cash flow  completing the integration of acquired businesses  growing its content delivery network services  continuing to implement its metro network strategy  and managing cash flows provided by its other communications services and sbc contract services 
management of level believes the introduction of new services or technologies  as well as the further development of existing technologies  may reduce the cost or increase the supply of certain services similar to those provided by level the ability of the company to anticipate  adapt and invest in these technology changes in a timely manner may affect the company s future success 
the company completed the initial planned deployment of the next generation of optical transport technology in its north american and european networks in the fourth quarter of and early in the first quarter of  respectively 
the company decided to deploy the technology for additional routes in north america and europe and completed the deployments on these routes in the company completed an upgrade of its ip backbone technology in the fourth quarter of level believes that this deployment of new equipment to the existing network equipment will allow the company to optimize the amount of traffic it carries over the network and lower its cost of providing its services 
to expand its service offerings in europe  the company invested approximately million for a dark fiber based expansion in europe 
during  the company obtained dark fiber primarily in those cities currently served by leased wavelength capacity and additionally in the company completed an expansion of our european operations to nine additional cities 
during  the company obtained dark fiber in three cities that had been served by leased wavelength capacity and additionally in the company completed an expansion of its european operations to nine additional cities 
in  the company expects to continue its european expansion to one additional city using leased wavelength capacity 
the company expects to use the dark fiber with appropriate transmission equipment to sell a full suite of transport and ip services 
the communications industry continues to consolidate 
level has participated in this process with the acquisitions of wiltel in  progress telecom  llc progress telecom  icg communications  inc icg communications  telcove  inc 
telcove and looking glass networks holding co  inc looking glass in  and broadwing corporation broadwing  the cdn business and servecast in level will continue to evaluate consolidation opportunities and could make additional acquisitions in the future 
the successful integration of acquired businesses into level is important to the success of level the company must integrate the networks and support organizations  while maintaining the service quality levels expected by customers in order to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions 
successful integration of these acquired businesses will depend on the company s ability to manage these operations  realize opportunities for revenue growth presented by strengthened service offerings and expanded geographic market coverage 
if the company is not able to efficiently and effectively integrate the acquired businesses or operations  the company may experience material negative consequences to its business  financial condition or results of operations 
during the second and third quarters of  the company s service activation times increased as a result of the following issues 
continuing to use the multiple order entry and provisioning systems and processes that were operated by the acquired companies to provision end to end services 
insufficient training on the multiple systems for employees performing service activation functions 
lack of sufficient staffing levels in some service activation areas 
identifying and fixing service activation throughput issues was challenging as a result of decentralizing service activation functions across the customer facing groups 
this increase in service activation cycle time had a negative effect on the company s service installation intervals and the rate of core communications services revenue growth during the second  third and fourth quarters of during this same period  the company also experienced challenges in its service management processes that resulted in longer response times to resolve customers network service issues 
as a result of consolidating key operational functions and organizations as part of the integration effort  the company s operating environment became more complex in the first half of during the second and third quarters  the company implemented certain process and organizational changes that were expected to improve service activation times and allow it to achieve its previously forecasted revenue and adjusted ebitda growth 
however these changes were not adequate to address the breadth of the problems encountered during the third quarter 
as a result of these service activation and service management issues  the growth in communications services revenue and adjusted ebitda was lower than expected for the full year and is expected to be lower than originally forecasted in for the full year the company has ongoing process and system development work that is being implemented as part of the integration efforts that is expected to address the service activation and service management issues described above as well as provide significant overall improvements to operations 
the processes and systems under development remain largely on track with certain components deployed beginning in october and additional deployments scheduled through the end of while the operational benefits vary by each project  the company expects to realize meaningful improvements in its operating environment during the second half of in addition  the company is taking steps to improve its existing processes and systems to address the increase in service activation times and improve its service management 
during the fourth quarter of  the company improved its provisioning capability by both increasing resources and through process improvement 
the company believes that its customers experiences with level have improved and the company continues to make process and organizational changes to improve its capabilities in level has embarked on a strategy to expand its current metro presence 
the strategy allows the company to increasingly terminate traffic over its owned metro facilities rather than paying third parties to terminate the traffic 
level s ability to provide high speed bandwidth directly to customer facilities is expected to be a competitive advantage 
the company intends to offer a broad range of services in these markets and concentrate its sales efforts on the bandwidth intensive businesses 
the expansion into new metro markets should also provide additional opportunities to sell services on the company s national and international networks 
this metro strategy included the acquisitions of progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass 
as part of its metro strategy and as a result of the acquisition of telcove in and broadwing in  the company is also targeting enterprise customers directly through its business markets group described in more detail below 
with the acquisition of the cdn business and servecast in  level embarked on a strategy to expand its content delivery network services in both the united states and europe 
the change in the composition of the company s revenue requires the company to manage operating expenses carefully and concentrate its capital expenditures on those technologies and assets that enable the company to develop its core communications services further and replace the decline in revenue and earnings from other communications services and sbc contract services 
in the third quarter of  level announced the formation of four customer facing groups to better serve the changing needs of customers in growing markets and drive growth across the organization the wholesale markets group services the communications needs of the largest national and global service providers  including carriers  cable companies  wireless companies  and voice service providers 
these customers typically integrate level services into their own products and services to offer to their end user customers 
revenue from the wholesale markets group represented of core communications services revenue for the business markets group targets enterprise customers and regional carriers who value a local  professional sales force 
specific customer markets include small  medium  and large businesses  local and regional carriers  state and local government entities  and higher education institutions and consortia 
revenue from the business markets group represented of core communications services revenue for the content markets group focuses on serving media and content companies with large and growing bandwidth needs 
customers in this market include video distribution companies  providers of gaming  mega portals  software service providers  social networking providers  as well as more traditional media distribution companies such as broadcasters  television networks and sports leagues 
revenue from the content markets group represented of core communications service revenue for the european markets group serves large european consumers of bandwidth  including the european and international carriers  large system integrators  voice service providers  cable operators  internet service providers  content providers  and government and education sectors 
revenue from the european markets group represented of core communications services revenue for the company believes that the alignment around customer markets should allow it to drive growth while enabling it to better focus on the needs of its customers 
beginning in  the company will disclose core communications services revenue in dollars and as a percentage of total core communications services revenue for each of its market groups  wholesale  business  content and europe 
in addition to the operational objectives mentioned above  the company has also been focused on improving its liquidity and financial condition  including efforts to extend the maturity dates of certain debt and lowering the effective interest rate on its outstanding debt 
in january  in two separate transactions  the company completed the exchange of million of outstanding principal of its convertible senior notes due for a total of million shares of level s common stock 
the company recognized a million loss on the exchanges in the first quarter of in february  level financing  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of level level financing issued million of its senior notes due and million of its floating rate senior notes due and received net proceeds of million 
the proceeds from these private offerings were used to refinance certain level financing debt and to fund the cost of construction  installation  acquisition  lease  development or improvement of other assets to be used in level s communications business 
in march  level financing refinanced its senior secured credit agreement and received net proceeds of billion 
the proceeds from this transaction were used to repay the existing million senior secured credit agreement and other debt 
the effect of this transaction was to increase the amount of senior secured debt from million to billion  reduce the interest rate on that debt from the london interbank offering rate libor plus to libor plus and extend the final maturity from to the company recognized a million loss on the extinguishment of the existing million senior secured term loan due due to recognition of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs 
during the first quarter of  the company redeemed the entire outstanding principal of the following debt issuances totaling million million of senior notes due at a price equal to of the principal amount  million of senior notes due at a price equal to of the principal amount  and million million of senior euro notes due at a price equal to of the principal amount 
also during the first quarter of  the respective issuers repurchased  through tender offers  million of the outstanding principal amounts of the following debt issuances million of its outstanding floating rate senior notes due at a price equal to  per  principal amount of the notes  which included  as the tender offer consideration and as a consent payment  million of its outstanding senior notes due at a price equal to  per  principal amount of the notes  which included  as the tender offer consideration and as a consent payment  million of its outstanding senior notes due at a price equal to  per  principal amount of the notes  which included  as the tender offer consideration and as a consent payment  and million million of its outstanding senior euro notes due at a price equal to  per  principal amount of the notes  which included  as the tender offer consideration and as a consent payment 
the company recognized a million loss associated with the redemptions and repurchases in the first quarter of the cash portion of the loss on redemptions and tenders totaled million and the remaining million consisted of unamortized debt issuance costs and unamortized discounts 
in the first quarter of  for total cash consideration of million and equity consideration of million shares of common stock valued at million all of broadwing s outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due were retired 
these debentures were issued by broadwing prior to level s acquisition of broadwing on january  there was no gain or loss recognized due to the fact that  under purchase accounting  the liability for the notes was valued at the total cost to retire the obligation 
the company will continue to look for opportunities to improve its financial position and focus its resources on growing revenue and managing costs for the communications business 
coal mining level  through its two owned joint venture surface mines in montana and wyoming  sells coal primarily through long term contracts with public utilities 
the long term contracts for the delivery of coal establish the price  volume  and quality requirements of the coal to be delivered 
revenue under these and other contracts is recognized when coal is shipped to the customer 
information services on november   the company sold its wholly owned subsidiary  i structure  llc  which provided computer outsourcing services primarily to small and medium sized businesses 
the company also completed the disposition of its remaining subsidiary in the information services business  software spectrum  inc on september  the results of operations and financial position for i structure and software spectrum are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report 
critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the effect of any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where these policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
revenue revenue for communications services  including voice  private line  wavelengths  colocation  internet access  managed modem  data services  video and dark fiber revenue is recognized monthly as the services are provided 
communications services are provided either on a usage basis  which can vary period to period  or at a contractually committed amount 
reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized when an interconnection agreement is in place with another carrier  or if an agreement has expired  when the parties have agreed to continue operating under the previous agreement until a new agreement is negotiated and executed  or at rates mandated by the fcc 
periodically  the company will receive payment for reciprocal compensation services in excess of fcc rates and before an agreement is in place 
these amounts are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet until a final agreement has been reached and the necessary regulatory approvals have been received at which time the reciprocal compensation revenue is recognized 
these amounts were insignificant to the company in and revenue attributable to leases of dark fiber pursuant to indefeasible rights of use agreements irus that qualify for sales type lease accounting  and were entered into prior to june   was recognized at the time of delivery and acceptance of the fiber by the customer 
certain sale and long term iru agreements of dark fiber and capacity entered into after june   are required to be accounted for in the same manner as sales of real estate with property improvements or integral equipment 
this accounting treatment results in the deferral of revenue for the cash that has been received and the recognition of revenue ratably over the term of the agreement currently up to years 
termination revenue is recognized when a customer disconnects service prior to the end of the contract period  for which level had previously received consideration and for which revenue recognition was deferred 
termination revenue is also recognized when customers make termination penalty payments to level to settle contractually committed purchase amounts that the customer no longer expects to meet or when a customer and level renegotiate a contract under which level is no longer obligated to provide product or services for consideration previously received and for which revenue recognition has been deferred 
termination revenue is reported in the same manner as the original product or service provided 
accounting practice and guidance with respect to the accounting treatment of revenue continues to evolve 
any changes in the accounting treatment could affect the manner in which the company accounts for revenue within its communications and coal businesses 
non cash compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r effective january  sfas no 
r requires that compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of equity or liability instruments issued 
the company adopted the expense recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 in therefore  the effect of applying the change from the original provisions of sfas no 
on the company s financial position or results of operations was insignificant 
although the recognition of the value of the instruments results in compensation or professional expenses in an entity s financial statements  the expense differs from other compensation and professional expenses in that these charges  though generally permitted to be settled in cash  are typically settled through the issuance of common stock  which would have a dilutive effect upon earnings per share  if and when such options are exercised 
the determination of the estimated fair value used to record the compensation or professional expenses associated with the equity or liability instruments issued requires management to make a number of assumptions and estimates that can change or fluctuate over time 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment is stated at cost  reduced by provisions to recognize economic impairment in value when management determines that events have occurred that require an analysis of potential impairment 
costs associated directly with network expansions and the development of business support systems  primarily employee related costs  are capitalized 
the company capitalized million  million and million of cost  primarily direct labor and related employee benefits  in  and  respectively 
intercity network segments  gateway facilities  local networks and operating equipment that have been placed in service are being depreciated over their estimated useful lives  primarily ranging from years 
the total cost of a business support system is amortized over a useful life of three years 
the useful lives of the company s assets are estimates and actual in service periods for specific assets could differ significantly from these estimates 
due to changes in technology and the competitive environment  these estimates require a significant amount of judgment 
management monitors and evaluates these estimates on an annual basis or as circumstances change that may indicate a change in estimate is required 
during the company extended the useful lives of its existing fiber assets from seven to years  its existing transmission equipment from five to seven years and its existing ip equipment from three to four years 
the company at least annually  or as events or circumstances change that could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  conducts a comprehensive review of the carrying value of its assets to determine if the carrying amount of the assets are recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
this review requires the identification of the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for purposes of grouping assets subject to review 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows includes long term forecasts of revenue growth  gross margins and capital expenditures 
all of these items require significant judgment and assumptions 
an impairment loss may exist when the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the long lived asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
the company assessed its communications long lived assets for impairment in the fourth quarter of  and determined that an impairment charge was not required 
the communications network includes network equipment  fiber  multiple conduits  customer premise equipment and colocation facilities 
the impairment analysis is based on a long term cash flow forecast to assess the recovery of the communications assets over their estimated useful lives 
level also assesses the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 

the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
the company also evaluates intangible assets with indefinite lives individually on an annual basis  or as events or circumstances change that could affect the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset  in accordance with sfas no 
the company did not record charges for the impairment of long lived assets or goodwill in  or management s estimate of the future cash flows attributable to its long lived assets and the fair value of its businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management s assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
the impairment analysis of long lived assets also requires management to make certain subjective assumptions and estimates regarding the expected future use of certain additional conduits evaluated for impairment separately from the network asset group 
management will continue to assess the company s assets for impairment as events occur or as industry conditions warrant 
given the significant uncertainty  judgment and assumptions involved in developing the estimates of future cash flows and the number of years of remaining useful life of certain of the company s assets  it is possible that the company may determine that an impairment charge is required in the future due to changes in these assumptions and estimates 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the most critical estimates and assumptions are made in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue reserves  recovery of long lived assets  useful lives of long lived assets  accruals for estimated tax and legal liabilities  cost of revenue disputes for communications services  unfavorable contracts recognized in purchase accounting and asset retirement obligations 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions

the company purchased progress telecom in march  icg communications in may  telcove in july and looking glass in august the company purchased broadwing and the cdn business in january and servecast in july from a financial reporting perspective  the company integrated into the level business the operations of wiltel  progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass in  and broadwing and the cdn business in the first half of as a result  separate revenue information by revenue category for these acquired companies is no longer reported other than for the sbc contract services revenue acquired from wiltel 
as described earlier  the growth in core communications services revenue was lower than expected during the second  third and fourth quarters of as a result of an increase in service activation times and challenges in service management processes 
service activation times increased during the second and third quarters as a result of the following issues 
continuing to use the multiple order entry and provisioning systems and processes that were operated by the acquired companies to provision end to end services 
insufficient training on the multiple systems for employees performing service activation functions 
lack of sufficient staffing levels in some service activation areas 
identifying and fixing service activation throughput issues was challenging as a result of decentralizing service activation functions across the customer facing groups in the third quarter of the company has ongoing process and systems development work that is being implemented as part of the integration efforts that is expected to address the service activation and service management issues described above and provide significant overall improvements to operations 
the processes and systems under development remain largely on track with certain components deployed beginning in october and additional deployments scheduled through the end of while the operational benefits vary by each project  the company expects to realize meaningful improvements in its operating environment during the second half of in addition  the company is taking steps to improve its existing processes and systems to address the increase in service activation times and improve its service management 
with respect to the latter  the company has seen improvements in its service response times in the fourth quarter of and expects to see further improvements in the future 
transport and infrastructure revenue increased for compared to the increase was the result of growth in existing services and the recognition of a full year of revenue in for progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass acquisitions completed in  as well as the revenue from the broadwing acquisition completed in january increased demand in the cable and wireless market segments for complex nationwide solutions and colocation capacity in large markets contributed to the revenue growth in existing services in as compared to ip and data revenue increased for compared to the increase was the result of growth in existing services and the recognition of a full year of revenue in for progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass acquisitions completed in  as well as a full year of revenue from the broadwing acquisition completed in early january ip and data revenue also increased in as a result of the cdn business acquisition completed in january and the servecast acquisition completed in july ip and data revenue also increased due to traffic growth in north america from new and existing customers that exceeded the rate of price compression experienced in during the second quarter of  the company also implemented new  reduced pricing under the terms of a contract renewal for its largest ip and data customer which partially offset the overall growth of ip and data revenue in the last half of continued revenue growth in the company s vpn service also contributed to the increase in ip and data revenue during level s voice revenue increased for compared to the increase is primarily attributable to the operations acquired in the telcove and broadwing acquisitions  particularly domestic and international voice termination services  and growth in level s existing wholesale and voip related services including voice termination  local inbound  enhanced local and toll free services 
level vyvx revenue increased for compared to the increase was a result of an increase in advertising distribution revenue and the continued demand for high definition broadcast services in sports  news and entertainment 
core communications services revenue for and includes million and million of termination revenue  respectively 
the company expects to recognize termination revenue in the future if customers desire to renegotiate contracts or are required to terminate service 
the company is not able to estimate the specific value of these types of transactions until they occur  but does not currently expect to recognize significant termination revenue for the foreseeable future 
managed modem revenue declined to million for compared to as a result of the continued migration from narrow band dial up services to higher speed broadband services by end user customers  especially in large metropolitan areas 
this change has resulted in a decline in the demand for managed modem ports 
in addition to the port cancellation provisions  the contracts with america online contain market pricing provisions that have the effect of lowering revenue as level is obligated to provide america online a reduced per port rate if level offers another customer better pricing for a lower volume of comparable services 
the declines in managed modem revenue from america online have been partially offset by increases in market share as a result of certain competitors exiting segments of the managed modem business in the first half of the company expects managed modem revenue to continue to decline in the future primarily due to an increase in the number of subscribers migrating to broadband services and potential pricing concessions as contracts are renewed 
reciprocal compensation revenue from managed modem services declined to million for compared to as a result of the continuing decline in demand for managed modem services 
the company has historically earned the majority of its reciprocal compensation revenue from managed modem services 
level has interconnection agreements in place for the majority of traffic subject to reciprocal compensation 
the majority of the company s interconnection agreements provided rate structures through level continues to negotiate new interconnection agreements or amendments to its existing interconnection agreements with local carriers 
as a result of the company s acquisitions of wiltel  telcove and broadwing  the company has started to generate a portion of its reciprocal compensation revenue from voice services 
for the full year ending december   the company recognized million of reciprocal compensation revenue earned from voice services  which are included in core communications services revenue 
to the extent that the company is unable to sign new interconnection agreements or signs new agreements containing lower rates  or there is a significant decline in the company s managed modem dial up business  or fcc or state regulations change such that carriers are not required to compensate other carriers for terminating isp bound traffic  reciprocal compensation revenue may decline significantly over time 
managed ip services revenue declined to million for compared to as discussed earlier  to date the company has not invested in this service and the decline in revenue is attributable to the disconnection of service by existing customers 
the company s legacy managed ip services business consists primarily of a business that was acquired in the company expects this trend to continue in sbc contract services revenue decreased to million for compared to as expected due to the migration of the sbc traffic to the at t network 
the sbc contract services agreement was obtained in december as part of the wiltel acquisition 
under the terms of the agreement  sbc has gross margin purchase commitments through sbc fully satisfied the million gross margin purchase commitment for the period from december through december during the third quarter of as a result of satisfying the initial gross margin purchase commitment  sbc s purchases of services that exceed the original million gross margin purchase commitment now count toward the million gross margin purchase commitment for the period from january through the end of as of december   sbc had satisfied million of the million gross margin purchase commitment 
level expects that  based on sbc s current level of spending  the remaining million of gross margin purchase commitment will be satisfied by sbc in the first half of additionally  the sbc contract services agreement provided for the payment of million from sbc if certain performance criteria were met by level the company met the required performance criteria and recorded annual revenue of million in both and under the agreement 
of the annual amounts  was based on monthly performance criteria and the remaining was based on performance criteria for the full year 
the company is no longer eligible for performance bonuses under the sbc contract services agreement after december  the company expects sbc revenue to continue to decline in however  sbc must still comply with the minimum gross margin commitments under the terms of the contract unless satisfied sooner 
beginning in the first quarter of  the company will change the way it reports core communications services revenue and will aggregate revenue from transport and infrastructure  ip and data  non wholesale voice and level vyvx services and report those results as core network services revenue 
domestic voice termination  international voice termination and toll free services will be totaled and reported as wholesale voice services revenue 
using this categorization  quarterly and full year communications services revenue would have been reported as shown in the table below quarter ended dollars in millions march  june  september  december  year ended december  communications services revenue core network services  wholesale voice services total core communications services other communications services sbc contract services total communications services revenue core network services revenue represents higher margin services and wholesale voice services represents lower margin services 
the company believes that given the increasing substitutability between transport and infrastructure services and ip and data services  trends in the communications business are best gauged looking at revenue trends in core network services 
coal mining revenue increased to million in compared to the increase was attributable to an increase in the tons of coal sold from the black butte mine  partially offset by a decrease in the tons of coal sold from the decker mine 
overall  the price per ton for coal from both mines was up slightly in compared to cost of revenue for the communications business  as a percentage of revenue  for and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  is primarily attributable to the continued decrease in sbc contract services revenue from to the margins for sbc contract services revenue are lower than the margins earned on other components included in core and other communications services revenue 
also contributing to the decrease in cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  are cost of revenue synergy savings that have been achieved as a result of acquisition integration efforts 
the company believes that cost of revenue synergy savings of million on an annualized basis have been achieved through integration efforts in the company expects cost of revenue for the communications business  as a percentage of revenue  to decrease slightly in as compared to coal mining cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  increased to for compared to in the increase in cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue  in as compared to was due to planned equipment maintenance costs at one mine and higher costs related to overburden removal at another mine 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for compared to the increase is primarily attributable to the increased depreciation and amortization expense recognized on communications tangible and intangible assets that were acquired through acquisitions completed in and  as well as depreciation expense on the approximately million increase in capital expenditures for compared to in addition  during the second quarter of  the company reviewed and adjusted the estimated useful lives used for amortization of customer related intangible assets for the icg communications  telcove and looking glass acquisitions effective june  this resulted in increased amortization expense of million during the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  the company finalized the purchase price allocation for the broadwing acquisition which resulted in reduced amortization expense related to intangible assets for the broadwing acquisition from the date of acquisition totaling approximately million  as compared to the total amortization expense that would have been recognized for prior to the change in the valuation of the intangible assets 
the increase in depreciation expense for was partially offset by a million decrease in depreciation expense compared to the same period in attributable to the increase in estimated useful lives for network fiber and ip and transmission equipment implemented in the second and third quarters of the company expects depreciation and amortization expense to decrease in to a range of million to million compared to due to the offsetting effects of increased depreciation expense on incremental capital expenditures  overall reduced amortization expense on intangible assets as a result of the useful lives changes and valuation changes described above and reduced depreciation and amortization expense associated with shorter lived tangible and intangible communications assets that were placed in service in prior years that are expected to become fully depreciated or amortized in selling  general and administrative expenses increased to billion in compared to this increase is primarily attributable to the expenses associated with the operations acquired in the progress telecom  icg communications  telcove and looking glass transactions during  the broadwing and cdn business transactions in january  and the servecast transaction in july specifically  increases in compensation  bonus and employee related costs  network related costs and facility based expenses all contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in offsetting the increases discussed above were selling  general and administrative expense synergy savings that have been achieved as a result of acquisition integration efforts 
as of the end of  the company believes that it has achieved annualized run rate synergies in selling  general and administrative expenses totaling approximately million 
also offsetting the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was a reduction in incentive based compensation expense of million as a result of lower than expected financial performance in selling  general and administrative expenses for included a million property tax benefit related to the company s facilities in the united kingdom 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for and were million and million  respectively  of non cash stock based compensation expense related to grants of outperform stock options and restricted stock units and restricted stock shares 
the increase in non cash compensation expense in compared to  is due to an increase in the number of restricted stock units and restricted stock shares issued to employees as a result of an increase in the number of employees eligible in compared to  an increase in the k employee match and annual discretionary grant made to the k plan and an increase in non cash compensation expense for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting of stock awards at retirement  with the overall increase partially offset by a reduction in the number of outperform stock options and units issued in compared to the number of employees eligible to participate in the company s stock based long term incentive plan increased significantly from to as a result of the employees of acquired companies becoming eligible to participate in the long term incentive plan at the beginning of in  the company recognized additional non cash stock based compensation expense totaling approximately million for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting of stock awards at retirement 
the company provides accelerated vesting of stock awards at the date an employee retires if the employee meets certain age and years of service requirements and certain other requirements 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of stock based employee awards are expensed over the minimum service period  which is from the grant date to the earliest vesting date 
therefore  the company is required to fully expense at the grant date the value of stock awards made to those employees that already meet both the age and years of service requirements for accelerated vesting at retirement at the date of grant 
if the employee will meet the age and years of service requirements for accelerated vesting at retirement sooner than the normal vesting period for the stock awards  then the company is required to use that shorter period for recognition of the non cash compensation expense associated with the grant 
included in the non cash compensation expense of million was million related to the revaluation of the october and january grants using may  as the revised grant date  in accordance with sfas no 
r 
as stated in the company s proxy materials for its annual meeting of stockholders  over the course of the years since april   the compensation committee of the company s board of directors had administered the stock plan under the belief that the action of the company s board of directors to amend and restate that plan effective april  had the effect of extending the original term of the plan to april  after a further review of the terms of the plan  however  the compensation committee determined that an ambiguity could exist as to the date of the expiration of the plan 
to remove any ambiguity  the board of directors sought the approval of the company s stockholders to amend the plan to extend the term of the plan by five years to september  this approval was obtained at the annual meeting of stockholders held on may  after taking into account the million increase in non cash compensation expense for the grants revalued using a may  grant date and the million increase in non cash compensation expense for the employees that are eligible for accelerated vesting at retirement as discussed above  non cash compensation increased million for compared to as part of a comprehensive review of its long term compensation program completed in the first quarter of  beginning with awards made on or after april   outperform stock options oso units are awarded monthly to employees in mid management level and higher positions  have a three year life  will vest on the third anniversary of the date of the award and will fully settle in net shares on that date 
oso units awarded beginning april  have exercise prices and are valued for non cash compensation purposes based on the closing price of level common stock on the last day of each month 
recipients have no discretion on the timing to exercise oso units granted on or after april   thus the expected life of all such oso units is three years 
the company expects selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in on an overall basis compared to the expected reduction in overall selling  general and administrative expenses is a result of reduced selling  general and administrative expenses for integration activities  reductions in headcount related to continuing integration activities and the deployment of improved business processes and systems during  offset by an increase in incentive based compensation compared to restructuring and non cash impairment charges declined to million in compared to the company recognized severance charges of million in and million in  related to workforce reductions in the communications business in north america 
the workforce reductions completed in were primarily related to the integration of companies acquired by level in and january as of december   the company had remaining obligations of approximately million 
the company recognized non cash impairment charges of million and million in and  respectively 
the non cash impairment charge of million in and million of the charge were primarily related to previously capitalized costs of certain information technology development projects no longer used by the company 
the costs incurred for these projects  including capitalized labor  were impaired as the company did not expect to utilize the assets in the future 
the remaining million non cash impairment charge in was related to excess land of the communications business deemed available for sale in germany 
this charge resulted from the difference between the recorded carrying value and the estimated market value of the land 
during the third quarter of  the company reclassified the excess land in germany to property  plant and equipment due to the fact the land had not been sold and was no longer being actively marketed for sale 
the company expects to continue to record restructuring charges in in connection with the continued integration of businesses acquired in and and as a result of the deployment of improved business processes and systems during that should result in reduced headcount 
the company continues to periodically conduct comprehensive reviews of the long lived assets of its businesses  specifically communication assets deployed along its intercity and metro networks and in its gateway facilities 
it is possible that assets may be identified as impaired and impairment charges may be recorded to reflect the realizable value of these assets in future periods 
adjusted ebitda  as defined by the company  is net income loss from the consolidated statements of operations before gain loss from discontinued operations  income taxes  total other income expense  non cash impairment charges included within restructuring and impairment charges as reported in the consolidated statements of operations  depreciation and amortization and non cash stock compensation expense included within selling  general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and may not be used by other companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is an important part of the company s internal reporting and is a key measure used by management to evaluate profitability and operating performance of the company and to make resource allocation decisions 
management believes such measures are especially important in a capital intensive industry such as telecommunications 
management also uses adjusted ebitda to compare the company s performance to that of its competitors 
management uses adjusted ebitda to eliminate certain non cash and non operating items in order to consistently measure from period to period its ability to fund capital expenditures  fund growth  service debt and determine bonuses 
adjusted ebitda excludes non cash impairment charges and non cash stock compensation expense because of the non cash nature of these items 
adjusted ebitda also excludes interest income  interest expense  income taxes and gain loss on extinguishment of debt because these items are associated with the company s capitalization and tax structures 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non cash expenses reflect the impact of capital investments which management believes should be evaluated through consolidated free cash flow 
adjusted ebitda excludes total other income expense because these items are not related to the primary operations of the company 
there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures  including the difficulty associated with comparing companies that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from the company s calculations 
additionally  this financial measure does not include certain significant items such as interest income  interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash impairment charges  non cash stock compensation expense  gain loss on early extinguishment of debt and total other income expense 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides a reconciliation of net income loss to adjusted ebitda for each of the company s operating segments 
adjusted ebitda for the communications business was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable to the adjusted ebitda contribution from the operations acquired in the progress telecom  icg communications  telcove  looking glass  broadwing  cdn business and servecast acquisitions  growth in the company s core communications services revenue and the benefits of cost of revenue and operating expense synergies realized in from integration activities  partially offset by declines in other communications services revenue  sbc contract services revenue and costs of integration incurred during as compared to adjusted ebitda for the coal mining business decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of coal sold from the black butte mine which has higher stripping ratios that result in higher overall costs and a planned increase in maintenance costs for mining equipment in the company expects adjusted ebitda to increase in compared to to a range of million to billion 
the expected increase in adjusted ebitda is based on continued growth in core communications services revenue  expected improvements in service delivery times  and the benefit of integration synergies in cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses realized from the broadwing acquisition 
interest income decreased to million in compared to the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a decrease in the average invested balance partially offset by an increase in the average return on the portfolio 
the company s average return on its portfolio increased to in compared to in the average portfolio balance decreased to billion in compared to billion in pending the utilization of cash and cash equivalents  the company invests its funds primarily in government and government agency securities  money market funds and commercial paper 
the investment strategy generally provides lower yields on the funds than would be obtained on alternative investments  but reduces the risk to principal in the short term prior to these funds being used in the company s business 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to interest expense decreased primarily as a result of the refinancing activities that were completed by the company in the first quarter of the overall reduction in interest expense is a result of the offsetting interest expense effects attributable to the following debt issuances  debt for equity exchanges  debt redemptions and debt repurchase transactions 
interest expense increased as a result of the following debt issuances billion of senior notes due issued in october and december  billion of senior notes issued in february consisting of million of senior notes due and million of floating rate senior notes due  and billion senior secured term loan due entered into in march to refinance the previously existing million senior secured term loan due the increase in interest expense from debt issuances described above was more than offset by the following debt for equity exchanges  debt redemptions and debt repurchases completed during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of million of senior notes due repurchased in december  million of convertible senior notes due exchanged in january for million shares of common stock  million of senior notes due redeemed in march  million of senior notes due redeemed in march  million million of senior euro notes due redeemed in march  million of floating rate notes due repurchased in march  million of senior notes due repurchased in march million of senior notes due repurchased in march  and million million of senior euro notes due repurchased in march level expects quarterly interest expense in to be consistent with the level of interest expense in the second and third quarters of of million per quarter based on outstanding debt balances as of december  loss on extinguishment of debt was million in compared to million in the loss on extinguishment of debt for was primarily the result of a million loss from the repurchase of certain debt and a million loss on the amendment and restatement of level financing s senior secured term loan due  partially offset by a million gain realized on a debt exchange 
the loss on extinguishment of debt for resulted from the following transactions 
million loss recognized for the january exchange of million of convertible senior notes due for approximately million shares of the company s common stock

these state tax nols were converted to a state tax credit carry forward associated with a change in the state tax law that replaced the tax on net income with a tax on gross margin 
the company now expects it will be able to use this state tax credit carry forward against current and future state taxable gross margin 
the company incurs income tax expense attributable to income in various level subsidiaries  including the coal business  that are required to file state or foreign income tax returns on a separate legal entity basis 
the company also recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to contingent tax benefits that have not been recognized in income tax expense  but have been recognized in the company s tax returns

if certain transactions occur with respect to level s capital stock that result in a cumulative ownership change of more than percentage points by percent stockholders over a three year period as determined under rules prescribed by the us internal revenue code irc and applicable regulations  annual limitations would be imposed with respect to the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss carry forwards and certain current deductions against any taxable income level achieves in future periods 
level has entered into transactions over the last three years resulting in significant cumulative changes in the ownership of its capital stock 
additional transactions could cause the company to incur a percentage point ownership change by percent stockholders and  if the company triggers the above noted irc imposed limitations  could prevent it from fully utilizing net operating loss carry forwards and certain current deductions to reduce income taxes
