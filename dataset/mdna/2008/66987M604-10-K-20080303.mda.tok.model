for a discussion of the important risks related to our business and future operating performance  see the discussion under the caption item a 
risk factors and under the caption factors which may influence future results of operations below 
in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
overview and background we are a provider of wireless broadband access solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market 
our broad range of products includes g wireless pc card and expresscard modems  embedded modems  fmc solutions and communications software for wireless network operators  infrastructure providers  distributors  oems and vertical markets worldwide 
through the integration of our hardware and software  our products are designed to operate on a majority of global wireless networks and provide mobile subscribers with secure and convenient high speed access to corporate  public and personal information through the internet and enterprise networks 
we also offer software engineering  integration and design services to our customers to facilitate the use of our products 
our strong customer relationships provide us with the opportunity to expand our market reach and sales 
most of our sales to wireless operators and oems are sold directly through our sales force 
to a lesser degree  we also use an indirect sales distribution model through the use of select distributors 
we are continuing to drive widespread adoption of our products through increased global marketing activities  expansion of our sales team and distribution networks and continued leverage of our strategic relationships with wireless industry leaders 
we intend to continue to identify and respond to our customers needs by introducing new product designs with an emphasis on supporting cutting edge wan technology  ease of use  performance  size  weight  cost and power consumption 
we manage our products through a structured life cycle process  from identifying initial customer requirements through development and commercial introduction to eventual phase out 
during product development  emphasis is placed on time to market  meeting industry standards and customer product specifications  ease of integration  cost reduction  manufacturability  quality and reliability 
we have agreements with lg innotek and iac for the outsourced manufacturing of our products 
under our manufacturing agreements  lg innotek and iac provide us with services including component procurement  product manufacturing  final assembly  testing  quality control  fulfillment and delivery 
in addition  we have an agreement with mobiltron for certain distribution  fulfillment and repair services related to our business in emea 
factors which may influence future results of operations we have entered into and expect to continue to enter into new customer contracts for the development and supply of our products and this may place significant demands on our resources 
revenue 
we believe that our revenue growth will be influenced largely by the speed and breadth of the increase in demand for wireless access to data through the use of next generation networks including demand for g products and g data access services  particularly in europe  north america and asia  customer acceptance 
table of contents for our new products that address these markets  and our ability to meet customer demand 
factors that could potentially affect customer demand for our products include the following demand for broadband access services and networks  use of the internet  rate of change to new products  loss of significant customers  increase in competition  timing of deployment of g networks by carriers  drop in demand for ev do  hsdpa and hsupa products  and changes in technologies 
we began shipping our first g products in december and anticipate introducing additional g products during we continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships with wireless and computing industry leaders like dell  qualcomm  sony  sprint pcs  verizon wireless and vodafone and major software vendors 
through strategic relationships  we have been able to increase market penetration by leveraging the resources of our channel partners  including their access to distribution resources  increased sales opportunities and market opportunities 
our strategic relationships include technology and marketing relationships with wireless operators  oem partners that integrate our products into other devices  distributors and leading hardware and software technology providers 
cost of revenue 
we currently outsource our manufacturing operations to lg innotek and iac 
in addition  we currently outsource certain distribution  fulfillment and repair services related to our business in emea to mobiltron 
all costs associated with these manufacturers and mobiltron are included in our cost of revenue 
cost of revenue also includes warranty costs  amortization of intangible licenses  royalties based on a percentage of revenue  operations group expenses  costs related to development services and costs related to inventory adjustments  including write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventory adjustments are impacted primarily by demand for our products  which is influenced by the factors discussed above 
during  and  we recorded inventory write downs of million  million and million  respectively  primarily due to the decrease in demand for the affected products 
we expect to continue to outsource our manufacturing operations  and as our business grows we expect our manufacturing activity to increase 
operating costs and expenses 
many of our products target wireless operators and other customers in europe  north america and asia 
if these markets continue to grow  we will likely develop new products to serve these markets  resulting in increased research and development expenses associated with such new product development 
we have in the past and expect to continue to incur these expenses in future periods prior to recognizing revenue from sales of these products 
the accounting for stock options began in the first quarter of and required us to use the fair value method to account for all stock based compensation pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  which significantly increased our operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies and significant 
table of contents estimates include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  provision for excess and obsolete inventory  valuation of intangible and long lived assets  provision for warranty costs  royalty costs  income taxes  foreign exchange forward contracts  and share based compensation expense 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is generated from the sale of wireless modems to wireless operators  oems and distributors 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the later of transfer of title or shipment of the product to the customer 
for product sales with acceptance conditions based upon the passage of contractually specified time periods  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of such time that the acceptance period expires or is waived by our customers upon request 
we grant price protection provisions to certain customers and track pricing and other terms offered to customers buying similar products to assess compliance with these provisions 
we establish allowances for estimated product returns and price protection in the period in which revenue is recognized 
in estimating future product returns  we consider various relevant factors  including our stated return policies and practices  and historical trends 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 which provides guidance on the application of us generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for our accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the allowance by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical losses  and changes in customer payment cycles and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this allowance 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  we review our customers credit worthiness periodically based on credit scores generated by independent credit reporting services  our experience with our customers and the economic condition of our customers industries 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of expense for any period if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual allowance for doubtful accounts and anticipate that we will be able to continue to make reasonable estimates in the future 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we review the components of our inventory and our inventory purchase commitments on a regular basis for excess and obsolete inventory based on estimated future usage and sales 
write downs in inventory value depend on various items  including factors related to customer demand  economic and competitive conditions  technological advances or new product introductions by us or our customers that vary from our current expectations 
whenever inventory is written down  a new cost basis is established and the inventory is not subsequently written up if market conditions improve 
we believe that  when made  the estimates we use in calculating the inventory provision are reasonable and properly reflect the risk of excess and obsolete inventory 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual inventory write downs 
if customer demand for our inventory is substantially less than our estimates  inventory write downs may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we periodically assess the valuation of intangible and long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we consider assets to be impaired if the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset  or significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents our assessment includes comparing the carrying amounts of intangible and long lived assets to their fair values  which are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
this model requires estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital and other relevant factors 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating our historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and other industry data 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
the timing and frequency of our impairment test is based on an ongoing assessment of triggering events that could reduce the fair value of our long lived assets below their carrying value 
we monitor our intangible and long lived asset balances and conduct formal tests on at least an annual basis or earlier when impairment indicators are present 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates we used to value intangible and long lived assets were appropriate based on the information available to management 
the majority of our long lived assets are being amortized or depreciated over relatively short periods  typically three to five years 
this reduces the risk of large impairment charges in any given period 
however  most of these assets are associated with technology that changes rapidly and such changes could have an immediate impact on our impairment analysis 
provision for warranty costs 
we accrue warranty costs based on estimates of future warranty related replacement  repairs or rework of products 
our warranty policy generally provides one to three years of coverage for products following the date of purchase 
our policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage as a component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations at the time revenue is recognized 
in estimating our future warranty obligations we consider various relevant factors  including the historical frequency and volume of claims  and the cost to replace or repair products under warranty 
the warranty provision for our products is determined by using a financial model to estimate future warranty costs 
our financial model takes into consideration actual product failure rates  estimated replacement over the contractual warranty period  repair or rework expenses  and potential risks associated with our different products 
the risk levels  warranty cost information  and failure rates used within this model are reviewed throughout the year and updated  if and when  these inputs change 
we actively engage in product improvement programs and processes to limit our warranty costs  but our warranty obligation is affected by the complexity of our product  product failure rates and costs incurred to correct those product failures 
the industry in which we operate is subject to rapid technological change  and as a result  we periodically introduce newer  more complex products 
we have not experienced significant variances in the past between our estimated and actual warranty costs 
depending on the quality of our product design and manufacturing  actual product failure rates or actual warranty costs could be materially greater than our estimates  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
royalty costs 
we have intellectual property license agreements which generally require us to make royalty payments based on a percentage of the revenue generated by sales of products incorporating the licensed technology 
we recognize royalty obligations in accordance with the terms of the respective royalty agreements 
we have also accrued for estimated royalty costs in situations where we do not have agreements based upon our current best estimate of the royalty obligation 
these estimates are based on various market data information and other relevant information 
if we enter into such agreements  or when additional market data becomes available  we will revise our estimates if necessary 
income taxes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or 
table of contents expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable to or refundable by tax authorities in the current fiscal year 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry forwards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and assess the valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
during  and  we recorded a non cash deferred income tax benefit of million  million and million respectively  for the change in the valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets 
we will continue to evaluate the necessity of the valuation allowance based on the remaining deferred tax assets 
foreign exchange forward contracts 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the economic exposure associated with accounts receivable balances denominated in euros 
our forward contracts do not qualify as accounting hedges 
we mark to market the forward contracts and include unrealized gains and losses in the current period as a component of other income expense 
during   and  we recorded unrealized losses of approximately  million and million  respectively  on our forward contracts 
these unrealized losses were offset by realized foreign currency gains on euro denominated transactions of approximately  and million during and  respectively 
the company realized foreign currency losses of approximately million during realized gains and losses on foreign exchange transactions are recorded in other income and expense 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding forward contracts amounted to million euros 
share based compensation expense 
we grant stock options and restricted stock to our employees and non employee directors under our current stock plan 
the benefits provided under this plan are share based payments subject to the provisions of sfas no 
r 
effective january   we adopted the requirements of sfas no 
r which addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
as a result of implementation of this accounting requirement  our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and include compensation expense as calculated per the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in adopting sfas no 
r  we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  thus our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to january  do not include any impact of sfas no 
r 
share based compensation expense related to stock options  our espp and restricted stock was million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r on january   we elected to value our share based payment option awards using the black scholes option pricing model as we had under the pro forma provisions of sfas no 
the determination of fair value of share based awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these significant assumptions include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards and the expected term of stock options 

table of contents we determined our expected volatility by using a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  to derive our expected volatility assumption as allowed under sfas no 
r and sab no 
implied volatility was based on three month traded options of our common stock 
we determined that the volatility calculated using a blend of implied volatility and our historical volatility was more reflective of expected volatility than using only historical volatility 
the expected term of stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term of options granted is estimated using the average of the vesting date  the contractual term and historical experience 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value under the black scholes option pricing model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of our stock 
our risk free interest rate assumption is based upon currently available rates on zero coupon us government issues for the expected term of our stock options 
the expected dividend rate is not applicable to us as we have not historically declared or paid dividends nor do we currently anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
sfas no 
r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and we have estimated our forfeitures based on historical experience 
we will revise this estimate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeiture rates differ from our estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas no 
for periods prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
if we change any of the critical assumptions that we use in the black scholes option pricing model such as expected volatility or expected term or if we decide to use a different valuation model in the future  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly in the future from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  as the guidance by regulators for sfas no 
r is relatively new  the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value using generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures related to fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively and is effective for all financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and for interim periods within those years 
however  the effective date of sfas as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis is expected to be deferred to fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
most of the provisions in sfas are elective  however the amendment to sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale securities 
the fair value option established by sfas permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a business entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
the company is assessing the impact of this standard to its financial statements to determine whether it will adopt the elective fair value provisions 
the amendment to sfas is not considered to have a significant impact to the company s financial statements 

table of contents in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
fas r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  if the company were to engage in any business combinations  the combinations would be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap until january  the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements of sfas no 
r  when effective  will depend on whether it engages in such activity  and also upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions it may consummate after the effective date 
the company will continue to assess the impact of this standard on our future consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated

general and administrative expenses in fiscal included share based compensation of million  compared to million in fiscal interest income and expense 
interest income  net increased by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily due to the increase in our average cash and marketable securities balances in  as well as an increase in the average yields realized on our marketable securities and cash balances  which resulted in higher income as compared to the same period in other income expense 
other income expense for the year ended december  decreased by approximately  or  to approximately  compared to million for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in our foreign exchange gains on our euro denominated receivable and cash balances 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax expense of approximately million for the year ended december   which represents an effective tax rate of 
the difference between the federal and state statutory combined rate of and our effective tax rate for is primarily due to the impact of accounting for share based compensation  for which certain share based awards are treated as permanent differences and the impact of tax credits for increased research and development expenses 
during  management evaluated the deferred tax valuation allowance and determined that the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets should not be significantly revised 
approximately  of deferred tax valuation allowance relating to the company s canadian subsidiary was released based on capital gains realized during  and due to higher future taxable income projections 
this determination was based on  and operating results and in anticipation of using net operating losses due to current projections of future taxable income 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately  excluding the valuation allowance revision 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was approximately negative  excluding the valuation allowance revision of the income tax benefit was approximately million  which was primarily due to a revision of our valuation allowance on specific canadian and us deferred tax assets of approximately million 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize a tax benefit upon expensing certain share based awards associated with our share based compensation plans  including nonqualified stock options and restricted stock  but under current accounting standards we cannot recognize a tax benefit currently for those share based compensation expenses associated with incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares qualified stock options 
for qualified stock options that vested after our adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognize a tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur  and for qualified stock options that vested prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  the tax benefit is recorded directly to additional paid in capital 
during  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million associated with total share based compensation 
the impact of share based compensation permanent items resulted in an increase of percentage points to the annual effective tax rate 
because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock and because a portion of that tax benefit may be recorded directly to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to reasonably estimate our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is diminished 
net income 
for the year ended december   we reported net income of million  as compared to net income of approximately  for the same period in the increase in net income was due to the growth in revenue and overall profitability of the company as discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue

the impact of share based compensation permanent items resulted in an increase of percentage points to the annual effective tax rate 
because we cannot recognize the tax benefit for share based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock and because a portion of that tax benefit may be recorded directly to additional paid in capital  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to reasonably estimate our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is diminished

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy that defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits our credit exposure to any single issuer 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to change as a result of changes in market interest rates and investment risk related to the issuers credit worthiness 
we do not utilize financial contracts to manage our exposure in our investment portfolio to changes in interest rates 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  all of which are stated at fair value 
changes in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the fair value of million of our cash and cash equivalents at december   as these consisted of securities with maturities of less than three months 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would  however  decrease or increase  respectively  the remaining million of our investments by approximately  while changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our investment portfolio  any gains or losses will not be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations until the investment is sold or if the reduction in fair value was determined to be other than temporary 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  approximately million of our sales transactions were denominated in euros 
in order to hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our accounts receivable balances we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts 
the effect of exchange rate changes on forward foreign exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items 
we believe these financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
if foreign currency rates were to fluctuate by from rates at december   our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all of our outstanding foreign currency contracts are marked to market  with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of other income and expense 
as of december  the total amount of outstanding forward contracts amounted to million euros 
during  we recorded unrealized losses of approximately  on our forward contracts 
these unrealized losses were offset by foreign currency gains of approximately million recorded in other income and expense related primarily to our foreign currency receivable and cash balances denominated in euros during revenues generated outside the united states  as a percentage of total revenues were approximately for the fiscal year ended december  and for significant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could impact future operating results
