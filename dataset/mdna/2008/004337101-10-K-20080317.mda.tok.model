our strategy historical and prospective we consider our business to be a young and emerging enterprise that is well positioned to be an effective competitor in the financial services industry over the long term 
our view of the financial services market place is that community banks must be effective in select market niches that are under served and stay clear of competing with large national competitors on a head to head basis for broad based consumer business 
we started by organizing a de novo national bank in the focus of the bank was and is serving the small to middle market businesses and their associated professionals in the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
we find that large national competitors are ineffective at addressing this market as it is difficult to distinguish where a business s financial needs stop and the personal financial needs of that business s professionals start 
emerging businesses and the finances of their owners are best served hand in hand 
our core competency is judgmental discipline of commercial lending based upon personnel and practices that help our clients strategize and grow their businesses from a financial perspective 
as financial success takes hold in the business  personal goals and wealth objectives of the business owners become increasingly important 
our second competency is a derivative of the first 
we have the personnel and know how to provide private banking services  the skills and strategy that assist our individual clients to acquire assets  build wealth and manage their resources 
mortgage banking and the related activities in our model goes hand in hand with supplying effective private banking services 
unlike most banking companies  the heart of our mortgage corporation is ingrained into our commercial bank  serving the same clients side by side in a coordinated and seamless fashion 
lending is not enough in today s environment 
the credit services must be backed up by competitive deposit and cash management products and operational excellence 
we have made significant investments in skilled personnel and the latest technology to ensure we can deliver on these promises 
we generally expect to have fewer branch locations compared to similar size banking companies 
we do not view our branch network as a significant determinant of our growth 
our marketing strategies focus on benefits other than branch location convenience 
the acquisition of the mortgage corporation in provided two key benefits to our strategy it solidified our second competency from a personnel and operational perspective that would have taken years to replicate with organic growth alone  and it provided a fee income and overhead base from which to launch a new banking business 
strong profits and cash flow from the mortgage corporation in the early years subsidized the growth and development of the bank and allowed for the acceleration of its growth plans and  in time  its profitability 
the long term goal was and is to generate of the corporation s earnings from the core business bank  with the rest of our consolidated earnings to be generated from related fee income activities 
at the present time  the sole related fee income activity remains our mortgage corporation 
we will consider entering other related fee income businesses that serve our target market as opportunities  market conditions and our capacity dictate 
the percentage contribution from our banking segment has grown steadily 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on segment performance 
we expect to grow our commercial bank by continuing to hire skilled personnel  train our own and provide a sound infrastructure that facilitates the success of businesses  their owners and key personnel  not only today but tomorrow and on into the ensuing decades 
lending activities the bank s lending activities involve commercial loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial and residential real estate construction loans  residential mortgage loans  home equity loans  and consumer loans 
these lending activities provide access to credit to small businesses  professionals and consumers in the greater washington  dc metropolitan area 
loans originated by the bank are classified as loans held for investment 
the mortgage corporation originates residential mortgages and home equity loans that are only held temporarily pending their sale to third parties and in some cases the bank 
the mortgage corporation also brokers loans that do not conform to existing products offered 
each of our principal loan types are described below 
at december  loans held for investment totaled million compared to million at year end the increase in loans is attributable to our customer base  referrals and new business 
the bank is predominantly a secured lender 
secured loans comprise over of the total loan portfolio 
the bank s lending activities are subject to a variety of lending limits imposed by federal law 
while differing limits apply in certain circumstances based on the type of loan  in general  the bank s lending limit to any one borrower on loans that are not fully secured by readily marketable or other permissible collateral is equal to of the bank s capital and surplus 
the bank has established relationships with correspondent banks to participate in loans when loan amounts exceed the bank s legal lending limits or internal lending policies 
we have an established credit policy that includes procedures for underwriting each type of loan and lending personnel have been assigned specific authorities based upon their experience 
loans in excess of an individual loan officer s authority are presented to our loan committee for approval 
the loan committee meets weekly to facilitate a timely approval process for our clients 
loans are approved based on the borrower s capacity for credit  collateral and sources of repayment 
loans are actively monitored to detect any potential performance issues 
we manage our loans within the context of a risk grading system developed by management based upon extensive experience in administering loan portfolios in our market 
payment performance is carefully monitored for all loans 
when loan repayment is dependent upon an operating business or investment real estate  periodic financial reports  site visits and select asset verification procedures are used to ensure that we accurately rate the relative risk of our assets 
based upon criteria that are established by management and the board of directors  the degree of monitoring is escalated or relaxed for any given borrower based upon our assessment of the future repayment risk 
loan portfolio loans held for investment 
the following outlines the composition of loans held for investment 
commercial loans commercial loans represent of our held for investment portfolio as of december  these loans are to businesses or individuals within our target market for business purposes 
typically the loan proceeds are used to support working capital and the acquisition of fixed assets of an operating business 
these loans are underwritten based upon our assessment of the obligor s ability to generate operating cash flow in the future necessary to repay the loan 
to address the risks associated with the uncertainties of future cash flow  these loans are generally well secured by assets owned by the business or its principal shareholders and the principal shareholders are typically required to guarantee the loan 
real estate construction loans real estate construction loans  also known as construction and land development loans  comprise of our held for investment loan portfolio  as of december  these loans generally fall into one of four circumstances first  loans to construct owner occupied commercial buildings  second  loans to individuals that are ultimately used to acquire property and construct an owner occupied residence  third  loans to builders for the purpose of acquiring property and constructing homes for sale to consumers  and fourth  loans to developers for the purpose of acquiring land that is developed into finished lots for the ultimate construction of residential or commercial buildings 
loans of these types are generally secured by the subject property within limits established by the board of directors based upon an assessment of market conditions and up dated from time to time 
the loans typically carry recourse to principal borrowers 
in addition to the repayment risk associated with loans to individuals and businesses  loans in this category carry construction completion risk 
to address this additional risk  loans of this type are subject to additional administrative procedures designed to verify and ensure progress of the project in accordance with allocated funding  project specifications and time frames 
commercial real estate loans also known as commercial mortgages  loans in this category represent of our loan portfolio held for investment  as of december  these loans generally fall into one of three situations in order of magnitude first  loans supporting an owner occupied commercial property  second  properties used by non profit organizations such as churches or schools where repayment is dependent upon the cash flow of the non profit organizations  and third  loans supporting a commercial property leased to third parties for investment 
commercial real estate loans are secured by the subject property and underwritten to policy standards 
policy standards approved by the board of directors from time to time set forth  among other considerations  loan to value limits  cash flow coverage ratios  and the general creditworthiness of the obligors 
residential real estate loans this category includes loans secured by first or second mortgages on one to four family residential properties  generally extended to bank clients  and represents of the portfolio  as of december  of this amount  the following sub categories exist as a percentage of the whole residential real estate loan portfolio home equity lines of credit  first trust mortgage loans  loans secured by a junior trust  multi family loans and loans secured by farmland 
home equity loans are extended to borrowers in our target market 
real estate equity is the largest component of consumer wealth in our marketplace 
once approved  this consumer finance tool allows the borrower to access the equity in their home or investment property and use the proceeds for virtually any purpose 
home equity loans are most frequently secured by a second lien on residential property 
one to four family residential first trust loan  or first mortgage loan  proceeds are used to acquire or refinance the primary financing on owner occupied and residential investment properties 
junior trust loans  or loans secured by a second trust loans  are to consumers wherein the proceeds have been used for a stated consumer purpose 
examples of consumer purposes are education  refinancing debt  or purchasing consumer goods 
the loans are generally extended in a single disbursement and repaid over a specified period of time 
loans in the residential real estate portfolio are underwritten to standards within a traditional consumer framework that is periodically reviewed and up dated by our management and board of directors repayment source and capacity  value of the underlying property  credit history  savings pattern and stability 
consumer loans consumer loans make up less than 
of our loan portfolio 
most loans are well secured with assets other than real estate  such as marketable securities or automobiles 
very few loans are unsecured 
as a matter of operation  management discourages unsecured lending 
loans in this category are underwritten to standards within a traditional consumer framework that is periodically reviewed and up dated by our management and board of directors repayment source and capacity  collateral value  credit history  savings pattern  and stability 
loans held for sale lhfs 
loans in this category are originated by the mortgage corporation and comprised of residential mortgage loans extended to consumers and underwritten in accordance with standards set forth by an institutional investor to whom we expect to sell the loan 
loan proceeds are used for the purchase or refinance of the property securing the loan 
loans are sold with the servicing released to the investor 
the lhfs loans are closed in our name and carried on our books until the loan is delivered to and purchased by an investor 
in  we originated million of loans processed in this manner 
at december  loans held for sale totaled million compared to million at year end the decrease in loans held for sale at year end is due to the reduced volume of loans closed during the month reflecting the decline in mortgage industry volumes 
during  a combination of rising interest rates and a decline in real estate values resulted in an increase in early payment defaults during the customary warranty period 
as a result  the mortgage corporation incurred approximately million in expenses related to loans repurchased and subsequent liquidation of the properties 
in order to mitigate the loss exposure due to early payment defaults  contracts with our two largest correspondent lenders  representing of volume  were modified in november to eliminate early payment default warranties on future production 
brokered loans brokered loans are underwritten and closed by a third party lender 
we are paid a fee for procuring and packaging brokered loans 
in  we originated a total volume of million in residential mortgage loans under these types of delivery methods 
brokered loans accounted for of the total loan volume of the corporation 
the risks associated with this activity are limited to losses or claims arising from fraud 
deposits deposits are the primary source of funding loan growth 
average deposits totaled million up from million  a million increase over at december  deposits totaled million compared to million on december   an increase of million 
market area the corporation  the bank  and the mortgage corporation are headquartered in fairfax county and serve the northern virginia region 
fairfax county is a diverse and thriving urban county 
as the most populous jurisdiction in both virginia and the greater washington dc metropolitan area  the county s population exceeds that of seven states 
the median household income of fairfax county is one of the highest in the nation 
northern virginia had a population of million according to the census 
the proximity to washington  dc and the influence of the federal government and its spending provides somewhat of a recession shelter 
competition the bank competes with virtually all banks and financial institutions which offer services in its market area 
much of this competition comes from large financial institutions headquartered outside the state of virginia  each of which has greater financial and other resources to conduct large advertising campaigns and offer incentives 
to attract business in this competitive environment  the bank relies on personal contact by its officers and directors  local promotional activities  and the ability to provide personalized custom services to small businesses and professionals 
in addition to providing full service banking  the bank offers and promotes alternative and modern conveniences such as internet banking  automated clearinghouse transactions  remote deposit capture  and offers courier services for commercial clients 
employees at december  the corporation had employees  of whom were employed by the bank and of whom were employed by the mortgage corporation 
none of the employees within the corporation is subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
management considers employee relations to be good 
supervision and regulation set forth below is a brief description of the material laws and regulations that affect the corporation 
the description of these statutes and regulations is only a summary and does not purport to be complete 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations summarized below 
no assurance can be given that these statutes or regulations will not change in the future 
general 
the corporation is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities and exchange act of  as amended the exchange act  which include  but are not limited to  the filing of annual  quarterly and other reports with the securities and exchange commission the sec 
as an exchange act reporting company  the corporation is directly affected by the sarbanes oxley act of the sox  which aimed at improving corporate governance and reporting procedures and requires expanded disclosure of the corporation s corporate operations and internal controls 
the corporation is already complying with new sec and other rules and regulations implemented pursuant to the sox and intends to comply with any applicable rules and regulations implemented in the future 
although the corporation has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  additional expense in complying with the provisions of the sox and the resulting regulations  such compliance has not had a material impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations and the management does not expect it to in the future 
the corporation is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  and is registered as such with  and subject to the supervision of  the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the federal reserve bank of richmond the frb 
generally  a bank holding company is required to obtain the approval of the frb before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  and before it may acquire ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if  after giving effect to the acquisition  the bank holding company would own or control more than of the voting shares of such bank 
the frb s approval is also required for the merger or consolidation of bank holding companies 
the corporation is required to file periodic reports with the frb and provide any additional information as the frb may require 
the frb also has the authority to examine the corporation and the bank  as well as any arrangements between the corporation and the bank  with the cost of any such examinations to be borne by the corporation 
banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law in dealings with their holding companies and other affiliates 
subject to certain restrictions set forth in the federal reserve act  a bank can loan or extend credit to an affiliate  purchase or invest in the securities of an affiliate  purchase assets from an affiliate or issue a guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate  as long as the aggregate amount of such transactions of a bank and its subsidiaries with its affiliates does not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of the bank on a per affiliate basis or of the capital stock and surplus of the bank on an aggregate affiliate basis 
in addition  such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
in particular  a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low quality asset  as defined in the federal reserve act 
these restrictions also prevent a bank holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts 
additionally  the corporation and its subsidiary are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
a bank holding company is prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company engaged in non banking activities 
a bank holding company may  however  engage in or acquire an interest in a company that engages in activities which the frb has determined by regulation or order are so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to banking 
in making these determinations  the frb considers whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company would offer advantages to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects 
as a national bank  the bank is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the office of the comptroller of the currency the comptroller 
each depositor s account with the bank is insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic to the maximum amount permitted by law 
the bank is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the frb and applicable provisions of virginia law  insofar as they do not conflict with or are not preempted by federal banking law 
the regulations of the fdic  the comptroller and frb govern most aspects of the corporation s business  including deposit reserve requirements  investments  loans  certain check clearing activities  issuance of securities  payment of dividends  branching  deposit interest rate ceilings and numerous other matters 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in the united states  the corporation s business is particularly susceptible to changes in state and federal legislation and regulations  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting permissible activities or increasing competition 
governmental policies and legislation 
banking is a business that depends primarily on interest rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rates paid by the bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest rates received by the bank on loans extended to its customers and securities held in its portfolio comprise the major portion of the corporation s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the corporation s control 
accordingly  the corporation s growth and earnings are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including inflation  recession and unemployment 
the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions  but is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of its regulatory agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of bank holding companies  banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the virginia legislature and brought before various bank holding company and bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood of any major changes and the impact such changes might have are impossible to predict 
dividends 
there are both federal and state regulatory restrictions on dividend payments by both the bank and the corporation that may affect the corporation s ability to pay dividends on its common stock 
as a bank holding company  the corporation is a separate legal entity from the bank 
virtually all of the corporation s income results from dividends paid to the corporation by the bank 
the amount of dividends that may be paid by the bank depends upon the bank s earnings and capital position and is limited by federal and state law  regulations and policies 
in addition to specific regulations governing the permissibility of dividends  both the frb and the virginia bureau of financial institutions are generally authorized to prohibit payment of dividends if they determine that the payment of dividends by the bank would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice 
the corporation meets all regulatory requirements and began paying dividends in february the corporation paid dividends totaling thousand in see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities 
capital requirements 
the frb  the comptroller and the fdic have adopted risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and banks 
these capital adequacy regulations are based upon a risk based capital determination  whereby a bank holding company s capital adequacy is determined in light of the risk  both on and off balance sheet  contained in the company s assets 
different categories of assets are assigned risk weightings and are counted at a percentage of their book value 
the regulations divide capital between tier capital core capital and tier capital 
for a bank holding company  tier capital consists primarily of common stock  related surplus  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries and a limited amount of qualifying cumulative preferred securities 
goodwill and certain other intangibles are excluded from tier capital 
tier capital consists of an amount equal to the allowance for loan and lease losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  limited other types of preferred stock not included in tier capital  hybrid capital instruments and term subordinated debt 
investments in and loans to unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries that constitute capital of those subsidiaries are excluded from capital 
the sum of tier and tier capital constitutes qualifying total capital 
the guidelines generally require banks to maintain a total qualifying capital to weighted risk assets level of the risk based capital ratio 
of the total  at least of the total qualifying capital to weighted risk assets the tier risk based capital ratio must be tier capital 
the frb  the comptroller and the fdic have adopted leverage requirements that apply in addition to the risk based capital requirements 
banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to average total consolidated assets the leverage ratio of at least for the most highly rated  financially sound banks and bank holding companies and a minimum leverage ratio of at least for all other banks 
the fdic and the frb define tier capital for banks in the same manner for both the leverage ratio and the risk based capital ratio 
however  the frb defines tier capital for bank holding companies in a slightly different manner 
an institution may be required to maintain tier capital of at least or  or possibly higher  depending upon the activities  risks  rate of growth  and other factors deemed material by regulatory authorities 
as of december   the corporation and bank both met all applicable capital requirements imposed by regulation 
federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia 
there are five capital categories applicable to insured institutions  each with specific regulatory consequences 
if the appropriate federal banking agency determines  after notice and an opportunity for hearing  that an insured institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition  it may reclassify the institution to the next lower capital category other than critically undercapitalized and require the submission of a plan to correct the unsafe or unsound condition 
the comptroller has issued regulations to implement these provisions 
under these regulations  the categories are a 
well capitalized the institution exceeds the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure 
a well capitalized institution is one i having a risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii having a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  iii having a leverage ratio of or greater and iv that is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure 
b 
adequately capitalized the institution meets the required minimum level for each relevant capital measure 
no capital distribution may be made that would result in the institution becoming undercapitalized 
an adequately capitalized institution is one i having a risk based capital ratio of or greater  ii having a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and iii having a leverage ratio of or greater or a leverage ratio of or greater if the institution is rated composite under the camels capital  assets  management  earnings  liquidity and sensitivity to market risk rating system 
c 
undercapitalized the institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
an undercapitalized institution is one i having a risk based capital ratio of less than or ii having a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or iii having a leverage ratio of less than  or if the institution is rated a composite under the camel rating system  a leverage ratio of less than 
d 
significantly undercapitalized the institution is significantly below the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
a significantly undercapitalized institution is one i having a risk based capital ratio of less than or ii having a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or iii having a leverage ratio of less than 
e 
critically undercapitalized the institution fails to meet a critical capital level set by the appropriate federal banking agency 
a critically undercapitalized institution is one having a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
an institution which is less than adequately capitalized must adopt an acceptable capital restoration plan  is subject to increased regulatory oversight  and is increasingly restricted in the scope of its permissible activities 
each company having control over an undercapitalized institution must provide a limited guarantee that the institution will comply with its capital restoration plan 
except under limited circumstances consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan  an undercapitalized institution may not grow 
an undercapitalized institution may not acquire another institution  establish additional branch offices or engage in any new line of business unless determined by the appropriate federal banking agency to be consistent with an accepted capital restoration plan  or unless the fdic determines that the proposed action will further the purpose of prompt corrective action 
the appropriate federal banking agency may take any action authorized for a significantly undercapitalized institution if an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails in any material respect to implement a plan accepted by the agency 
a critically undercapitalized institution is subject to having a receiver or conservator appointed to manage its affairs and for loss of its charter to conduct banking activities 
an insured depository institution may not pay a management fee to a bank holding company controlling that institution or any other person having control of the institution if  after making the payment  the institution  would be undercapitalized 
in addition  an institution cannot make a capital distribution  such as a dividend or other distribution that is in substance a distribution of capital to the owners of the institution if following such a distribution the institution would be undercapitalized 
thus  if payment of such a management fee or the making of such would cause the bank to become undercapitalized  it could not pay a management fee or dividend to the corporation 
as of december   both the corporation and the bank were considered well capitalized 
deposit insurance assessments 
the bank s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the deposit insurance fund the dif of the fdic 
the dif is the successor to the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund  which were merged in the fdic recently amended its risk based assessment system for to implement authority granted by the federal deposit insurance reform act of fdira 
under the revised system  insured institutions are assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations  regulatory capital levels and certain other factors 
an institution s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned 
unlike the other categories  risk category i  which contains the least risky depository institutions  contains further risk differentiation based on the fdic s analysis of financial ratios  examination component ratings and other information 
assessment rates are determined by the fdic and currently range from five to seven basis points for the healthiest institutions risk category i to basis points of assessable deposits for the riskiest risk category iv 
the fdic may adjust rates uniformly from one quarter to the next  except that no single adjustment can exceed three basis points 
fdira also provided for the possibility that the fdic may pay dividends to insured institutions if the dif reserve ratio equals or exceeds of estimated insured deposits 
gramm leach bliley act of the gramm leach bliley act of the glba implemented major changes to the statutory framework for providing banking and other financial services in the united states 
the glba  among other things  eliminated many of the restrictions on affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance firms and other financial service providers 
a bank holding company that qualifies as a financial holding company will be permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complimentary to financial activities 
the activities that the glba expressly lists as financial in nature include insurance underwriting  sales and brokerage activities  providing financial and investment advisory services  underwriting services and limited merchant banking activities 
to become eligible for these expanded activities  a bank holding company must qualify as a financial holding company 
to qualify as a financial holding company  each insured depository institution controlled by the bank holding company must be well capitalized  well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the cra discussed below 
in addition  the bank holding company must file with the federal reserve a declaration of its intention to become a financial holding company 
while the corporation satisfies these requirements  the corporation has not elected for various reasons to be treated as a financial holding company under the glba 
we do not believe that the glba has had a material adverse impact on the corporation s or the bank s operations 
to the extent that it allows banks  securities firms and insurance firms to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the glba may have the result of increasing competition that we face from larger institutions and other companies offering financial products and services  many of which may have substantially greater financial resources 
the glba and certain other regulations issued by federal banking agencies also provide new protections against the transfer and use by financial institutions of consumer nonpublic personal information 
a financial institution must provide to its customers  at the beginning of the customer relationship and annually thereafter  the institution s policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information 
these privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customer s personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that the information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure 
community reinvestment act 
the bank is subject to the requirements of the community reinvestment act the cra 
the cra imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions 
a financial institution s efforts in meeting community credit needs currently are evaluated as part of the examination process pursuant to three performance tests 
these factors also are considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
federal home loan bank fhlb of atlanta 
the bank is a member of the fhlb of atlanta  which is one of twelve regional fhlbs that provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development lending 
each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
it is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
it makes loans to members ie  advances in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the fhlb 
as a member the bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the fhlb in an amount equal to of aggregate outstanding advances in addition to the membership stock requirement of of the bank s total assets 
mortgage banking regulation

those rules and regulations  among other things  establish standards for loan origination  prohibit discrimination  provide for inspections and appraisals of property  require credit reports on prospective borrowers and  in some cases  restrict certain loan features and fix maximum interest rates and fees 
in addition to other federal laws  mortgage origination activities are subject to the equal credit opportunity act  truth in lending act  home mortgage disclosure act  real estate settlement procedures act  and home ownership equity protection act  and the regulations promulgated there under 
these laws prohibit discrimination  require the disclosure of certain basic information to mortgagors concerning credit and settlement costs  limit payment for settlement services to the reasonable value of the services rendered and require the maintenance and disclosure of information regarding the disposition of mortgage applications based on race  gender  geographical distribution and income level 
usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act became effective on october  and provides for the facilitation of information sharing among governmental entities and financial institutions for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering 
among other provisions  the usa patriot act permits financial institutions  upon providing notice to the united states treasury  to share information with one another in order to better identify and report to the federal government concerning activities that may involve money laundering or terrorists activities 
the usa patriot act is considered a significant banking law in terms of information disclosure regarding certain customer transactions 
certain provisions of the usa patriot act impose the obligation to establish anti money laundering programs  including the development of a customer identification program  and the screening of all customers against any government lists of known or suspected terrorists 
although it does create a reporting obligation and a cost of compliance  the bank does not expect the usa patriot act to materially affect its products  services or other business activities 
reporting terrorist activities 
the federal bureau of investigation fbi has sent  and will send  our banking regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities 
the bank has been requested  and will be requested  to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists 
if the bank finds any relationships or transactions  it must file a suspicious activity report and contact the fbi 
the office of foreign assets control ofac  which is a division of the department of the treasury  is responsible for helping to insure that united states entities do not engage in transactions with enemies of the united states  as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress 
ofac has sent  and will send  our banking regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding  harboring or engaging in terrorist acts 
if the bank finds a name on any transaction  account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list  it must freeze such account  file a suspicious activity report and notify the fbi 
the bank has appointed an ofac compliance officer to oversee the inspection of its accounts and the filing of any notifications 
the bank actively checks high risk ofac areas such as new accounts  wire transfers and customer files 
the bank performs these checks utilizing software  which is updated each time a modification is made to the lists provided by ofac and other agencies of specially designated nationals and blocked persons 
consumer laws and regulations 
the bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act and the fair housing act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions transact business with customers 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
item a risk factors our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in the highly competitive financial services industry 
we face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors 
in particular  there is very strong competition for financial services in northern virginia and the greater washington  dc metropolitan area in which we conduct a substantial portion of our business 
we compete with commercial banks  credit unions  savings and loan associations  mortgage banking firms  consumer finance companies  securities brokerage firms  insurance companies  money market funds and other mutual funds  as well as other local and community  super regional  national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere 
our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive financial services environment 
many of our competitors are well established  larger financial institutions and many offer products and services that we do not 
many have substantially greater resources  name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business 
some of our competitors are not subject to the same regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured national banks  including credit unions which do not pay federal income tax  and  therefore  have regulatory advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various services 
while we believe we compete effectively with these other financial institutions in our primary markets  we may face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our smaller size  smaller asset base  lack of geographic diversification and inability to spread our marketing costs across a broader market 
if we have to raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on loans to compete effectively  our net interest margin and income could be negatively affected 
failure to compete effectively to attract new or to retain existing  clients may reduce or limit our net income and our market share and may adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and growth 
our profitability depends on interest rates generally  and we may be adversely affected by changes in government monetary policy 
our profitability depends in substantial part on our net interest margin  which is the difference between the rates we receive on loans and investments and the rates we pay for deposits and other sources of funds 
our net interest margin depends on many factors that are partly or completely outside of our control  including competition  federal economic  monetary and fiscal policies  and economic conditions generally 
our net interest income will be adversely affected if market interest rates change so that the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings increases faster than the interest we earn on loans and investments 
changes in interest rates  particularly by the board of governors of the federal reserve system  which implements national monetary policy in order to mitigate recessionary and inflationary pressures  also affect the value of our loans 
in setting its policy  the federal reserve may utilize techniques such as i engaging in open market transactions in united states government securities  ii setting the discount rate on member bank borrowings  and iii determining reserve requirements 
these techniques may have an adverse effect on our deposit levels  net interest margin  loan demand or our business and operations 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could adversely affect borrowers ability to pay the principal or interest on existing loans or reduce their desire to borrow more money 
this may lead to an increase in our nonperforming assets  a decrease in loan originations  or a reduction in the value of and income from our loans  any of which could have a material and negative effect on our results of operations 
we try to minimize our exposure to interest rate risk  but we are unable to completely eliminate this risk 
fluctuations in market rates and other market disruptions are neither predictable nor controllable and may have a material and negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
as a lender  we are exposed to the risk that our loan clients may not repay their loans according to their terms and any collateral securing payment may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs we incur disposing of the collateral 
although we have collateral for most of our loans  that collateral can fluctuate in value and may not always cover the outstanding balance on the loan 
with most of our loans concentrated in northern virginia  a decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the values of our real estate collateral 
consequently  a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse 
in addition to assessing the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of each of our borrowers  the bank often secures loans with real estate collateral 
at december   approximately of our bank s loans held for investment have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral 
the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  our earnings and capital could be adversely affected 
our business strategy includes the continuation of our growth plans  and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively 
we intend to continue to grow in our existing banking markets internally and through additional offices and to expand into new markets as appropriate opportunities arise 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies that are experiencing growth 
we cannot assure you we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets  or that any expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations 
failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  future prospects  financial condition or results of operations  and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy 
also  if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines  our operating results could be materially affected in an adverse way 
our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors  including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities  the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas and our ability to manage our growth 
while we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth  there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or growth will be successfully managed 
we may face risks with respect to future acquisitions 
as a strategy  we have sought to increase the size of our business by pursuing business development opportunities  and we have grown rapidly since our incorporation 
as part of that strategy  we have acquired three mortgage companies and a small equipment leasing company 
we may acquire other financial institutions and mortgage companies  or parts of those entities  in the future 
acquisitions and mergers involve a number of risks  including the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners  the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target entity may not be accurate  the time and costs of evaluating new markets  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices  and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  our ability to finance an acquisition and possible ownership or economic dilution to our current shareholders  the diversion of our management s attention to the negotiation of a transaction  and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses  entry into new markets where we lack experience  the introduction of new products and services into our business  the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short term effects on our results of operations  and the potential loss of key employees and clients 
we may incur substantial costs to expand  and we can give no assurance such expansion will result in the levels of profits we seek 
there can be no assurance that integration efforts for any future mergers or acquisitions will be successful 
also  we may issue equity securities  including common stock and securities convertible into shares of our common stock  in connection with future acquisitions  which could cause ownership and economic dilution to our current shareholders 
there is no assurance that  following any future merger or acquisition  our integration efforts will be successful or our company  after giving effect to the acquisition  will achieve profits comparable to or better than our historical experience 
our allowance for loan losses could become inadequate and reduce our earnings and capital 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate for absorbing any potential losses in our loan portfolio 
management conducts a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses based upon general market conditions  credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of our clients relative to their financial obligations with us 
the amount of future losses  however  is susceptible to changes in economic and other market conditions  including changes in interest rates and collateral values  that are beyond our control  and these future losses may exceed our current estimates 
our allowance for loan losses at december  was million 
although we believe the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio  we cannot predict such losses or guarantee that our allowance will be adequate in the future 
excessive loan losses could have a material impact on our financial performance and reduce our earnings and capital 
liquidity needs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on dividends from the bank as our primary source of funds 
the primary source of funds of the bank are client deposits and loan repayments 
while scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  they are subject to the ability of borrowers to repay the loans 
the ability of borrowers to repay loans can be adversely affected by a number of factors  including changes in economic conditions  adverse trends or events affecting business industry groups  reductions in real estate values or markets  business closings or lay offs  inclement weather  natural disasters and international instability 
additionally  deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors  including rates paid by competitors  general interest rate levels  regulatory capital requirements  returns available to clients on alternative investments and general economic conditions 
accordingly  we may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations 
such sources include fhlb advances  sales of securities and loans  and federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks  as well as out of market time deposits 
while we believe that these sources are currently adequate  there can be no assurance they will be sufficient to meet future liquidity demands  particularly if we continue to grow and experience increasing loan demand 
we may be required to slow or discontinue loan growth  capital expenditures or other investments or liquidate assets should such sources not be adequate 
we are subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our earnings 
we operate in a highly regulated industry  and both we and the bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the frb  the comptroller  and the fdic 
our compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain of our activities  including payment of dividends  mergers and acquisitions  investments  loans and interest rates charged  interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices 
we are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators  which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our growth 
many of these regulations are intended to protect depositors and the fdic s deposit insurance fund rather than our shareholders 
sox  and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec and nasdaq that are applicable to us  have increased the scope  complexity and cost of corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  including the cost of completing our audit and maintaining our internal controls 
as a result  we may experience greater compliance costs 
the laws and regulations that apply to us could change at any time 
we cannot predict whether or what form of proposed statute or regulation will be adopted or the extent to which such adoption may affect our business 
regulatory changes may increase our costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products and thus place other entities that are not subject to similar regulation in stronger  more favorable competitive positions  which could adversely affect our growth and our ability to operate profitably 
failure to comply with existing or new laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our recent results may not be indicative of our future results 
we may not be able to sustain our historical rate of growth or may not even be able to grow our business at all 
in addition  our recent and rapid growth may distort some of our historical financial ratios and statistics 
in the future  we may not have the benefit of several recently favorable factors  such as a generally stable interest rate environment  a strong real estate market  or the ability to find suitable expansion opportunities 
various factors  such as economic conditions  regulatory and legislative considerations and competition  may also impede or prohibit our ability to expand our market presence 
if we experience a significant decrease in our historical rate of growth  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected due to a high percentage of our operating costs being fixed expenses 
our hedging strategies may not be successful in managing our risks associated with interest rates 
we use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks  but no hedging strategy can protect us completely 
when rates change  we expect to record a gain or loss on derivatives that would be offset by an inverse change in the value of loans held for sale and mortgage related securities 
we cannot assure you  however  that our hedging strategy and use of derivatives will offset the risks related to changes in interest rates 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and item a quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure 
the profitability of the mortgage corporation will be significantly reduced if we are not able to sell mortgages 
currently  we sell all of the mortgage loans originated by the mortgage corporation 
we only underwrite mortgages that we reasonably expect will have more than one potential purchaser 
the profitability of our mortgage company depends in large part upon our ability to originate or purchase a high volume of loans and to quickly sell them in the secondary market 
thus  we are dependent upon i the existence of an active secondary market and ii our ability to sell loans into that market 
the mortgage corporation s ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single family mortgage loans  which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by fannie mae and freddie mac and other institutional and non institutional investors 
these entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans 
some of the largest participants in the secondary market  including fannie mae and freddie mac  are government sponsored enterprises whose activities are governed by federal law  and while we do not actively participate in their programs  they do have substantial market influence 
any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these government sponsored enterprises and other institutional and non institutional investors or any impairment of our ability to participate in such programs could  in turn  adversely affect our operations 
we may be exposed to greater risks from offering non conforming mortgage loans 
we are an originator of non conforming residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market 
these are residential mortgages that do not qualify for purchase by government sponsored agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac 
our operations may be negatively affected due to our investments in non conforming mortgage loans 
credit  liquidity and repurchase risks associated with non conforming mortgage loans may be greater than those for conforming mortgage loans 
we  therefore  may assume a greater risk of increased delinquency rates and or credit losses  as well as interest rate risk  by offering non conforming products 
our small to medium sized business target market may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy 
we target our commercial development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small and medium sized businesses 
these businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
if general economic conditions negatively impact this economic sector in the markets in which we operate  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties  we may rely on information furnished to us by or on behalf of clients and counterparties  including financial statements and other financial information 
we also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and  with respect to financial statements  on reports of independent auditors 
for example  in deciding whether to extend credit to clients  we may assume that a customer s audited financial statements conform with gaap and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial condition  results of operations and cash flows of the customer 
our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted to the extent we rely on financial statements or other information that does not comply with gaap or is materially misleading 
negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings 
reputation risk  or the risk to our business  earnings and capital from negative public opinion  is inherent in our business 
negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities  including lending practices  corporate governance and acquisitions  and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities 
negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to keep and attract clients and employees and can expose us to litigation and regulatory action 
because virtually all of our businesses operate under the access national brand  actual or alleged conduct by one business can result in negative public opinion about our other businesses 
although we take steps to minimize reputation risk in dealing with our clients and communities  this risk will always be present given the nature of our business 
we depend on the services of key personnel  and a loss of any of those personnel could disrupt our operations and result in reduced revenues 
our success depends upon the continued service of our senior management team and upon our ability to attract and retain qualified financial services personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense 
in our experience  it can take a significant period of time to identify and hire personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required in carrying out our strategy 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we may need to invest in new technology to compete effectively  and that could have a negative effect on our operating results and the value of our common stock 
the market for financial services  including banking services  is increasingly affected by advances in technology  including developments in telecommunications  data processing  computers  automation and internet based banking 
we depend on third party vendors for portions of our data processing services 
in addition to our ability to finance the purchase of those services and integrate them into our operations  our ability to offer new technology based services depends on our vendors abilities to provide and support those services 
future advances in technology may require us to incur substantial expenses that adversely affect our operating results  and our limited capital resources may make it impractical or impossible for us to keep pace with competitors possessing greater capital resources 
our ability to compete successfully in our banking markets may depend on the extent to which we and our vendors are able to offer new technology based services and on our ability to integrate technological advances into our operations 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions  and we may be unable to pay future dividends 
our ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient consolidated capital 
also  our only source of funds with which to pay dividends to our shareholders is dividends we receive from our bank  and the bank s ability to pay dividends to us is limited by its own obligations to maintain sufficient capital and regulatory restrictions 
if these regulatory requirements are not satisfied  we will be unable to pay dividends on our common stock 
we paid our first cash dividends on february  we cannot guarantee that dividends will not be reduced or eliminated in future periods 
certain provisions under our articles of incorporation and applicable law may make it difficult for others to obtain control of our corporation even if such a change in control may be favored by some shareholders 
in addition to the amount of common stock controlled by our chairman of the board and other principal shareholders  certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and applicable virginia corporate and banking law may have the effect of discouraging a change of control of our company even if such a transaction is favored by some of our shareholders and could result in shareholders receiving a substantial premium over the current market price of our shares 
the primary purpose of these provisions is to encourage negotiations with our management by persons interested in acquiring control of our corporation 
these provisions may also tend to perpetuate present management and make it difficult for shareholders owning less than a majority of the shares to be able to elect even a single director

such actions are not considered material by management unless otherwise disclosed

critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principals of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimatable and ii sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
an allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based upon industry standards  known risk characteristics  management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
such evaluation considers among other factors  the estimated market value of the underlying collateral  and current economic conditions 
for further information about our practices with respect to allowance for loan losses  please see the subsection loans below 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities the bank s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale 
the estimated fair value of the portfolio fluctuates due to changes in market interest rates and other factors 
changes in estimated fair value are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of comprehensive income 
securities are monitored to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
management evaluates the investment portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine the collectability of amounts due per the contractual terms of the investment security 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
at december  there were no securities with other than temporary impairment 
derivative financial instruments the mortgage corporation carries all derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended statement  provides specific accounting provisions for derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting 
the mortgage corporation has not elected to apply hedge accounting to its derivative instruments as provided in statement see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on derivatives 
financial condition summary the corporation completed its eighth year of operation and recorded net income of million 
earnings in were impacted by an increase in expenses of million associated with loans repurchased by our mortgage corporation and a million increase in the bank s allowance for loan losses as a result of growth in loans held for investment 
as a result of the volatility in the mortgage industry  we have eliminated the wholesale mortgage operations  revised our product offerings and strengthened our underwriting guidelines 
these actions are expected to cause a reduction in mortgage origination volume and improve the future prospects for a profitable mortgage operation 
during  we opened two new banking offices  one in leesburg  virginia and the other in manassas  virginia 
both of these offices are in two of the fastest growing areas of northern virginia 
total assets at december  were million compared to million in the decrease in total assets is primarily due to a million decrease in investment securities and a million decrease in loans held for sale  partially offset by an increase in loans held for investment of approximately million 
the following discussions by major categories explain the changes in financial condition 
investment securities the corporation s securities portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  municipal securities  cra mutual fund  mortgage backed securities  frb and fhlb stock 
the investment portfolio is used to provide liquidity and as a tool for managing interest sensitivity in the balance sheet  while generating a reasonable return 
at december  the estimated fair value of the securities portfolio totaled million  down from million  in the decrease is due to maturities in the investment portfolio that were not reinvested 
all securities were classified as available for sale 
the financial accounting standards board fasb requires that securities classified as available for sale be accounted for at fair market value

the bank concentrates on providing banking services to small to medium sized businesses and professionals in our market area 
our loan officers maintain a professional relationship with our clients and are responsive to their financial needs 
they are directly involved in the community and it is this involvement and commitment that leads to referrals and continued growth 
commercial loans increased by approximately million from last year 
loans secured by commercial real estate increased million  a increase over the growth in commercial real estate loans reflects our commitment to local owner occupied commercial financing 
real estate construction loans decreased million  a decrease over last year 
this loan category is comprised of construction and land development loans 
competition for loans in this somewhat cyclical category is very high 
residential real estate loans increased million in consumer loans totaled million in and thousand in the bank offers a complete line of consumer lending products  primarily as a service to the affiliates of our commercial and professional clients 
the bank does not actively market its consumer products at this time  which accounts for the nominal amount of consumer loans 
loans held for sale totaled million at december  compared to million at december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in loans held for sale is due to a decrease in loans originated during the month of december  loan origination volume increased million from to billion in the increase in loan originations occurred during the first half of prior to the downturn in the housing industry

although actual loan losses have been insignificant  our senior credit management  with nearly years in collective experience in managing similar portfolios in our marketplace  concluded the amount of our reserve and the methodology applied to arrive at the amount of the reserve is justified and appropriate 
outside of our own analysis  our reserve adequacy and methodology are reviewed on a regular basis by an internal audit program  and bank regulators and such reviews have not resulted in any material adjustment to the reserve 
the overall allowance for loan losses is equivalent to approximately of total loans held for investment 
the schedule below  allocation of the allowance for loan losses  reflects the pro rata allocation by the different loan types 
the methodology as to how the allowance was derived is a combination of specific allocations and percentage allocations of the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses  as discussed below 
the bank has developed a comprehensive risk weighting system based on individual loan characteristics that enables the bank to allocate the composition of the allowance for loan losses by types of loans 
the methodology as to how the allowance was derived is detailed below 
unallocated amounts included in the allowance for loan losses have been applied to the loan classifications on a percentage basis 
adequacy of the reserve is assessed  and appropriate expense and charge offs are taken  no less frequently than at the close of each fiscal quarter end 
the methodology by which we systematically determine the amount of our reserve is set forth by the board of directors in our credit policy 
under this policy  our chief credit officer is charged with ensuring that each loan is individually evaluated and the portfolio characteristics are evaluated to arrive at an appropriate aggregate reserve 
the results of the analysis are documented  reviewed and approved by the board of directors no less than quarterly 
the following elements are considered in this analysis loss estimates on specific problem credits the specific reserve  individual loan risk ratings  lending staff changes  loan review and board oversight  loan policies and procedures  portfolio trends with respect to volume  delinquency  composition concentrations of credit  risk rating migration  levels of classified credit  off balance sheet credit exposure  any other factors considered relevant from time to time the general reserve and  finally  an unallocated reserve to cover any unforeseen factors not considered above in the appropriate magnitude 
each of the reserve components  general  specific and unallocated are discussed in further detail below 
with respect to the general reserve  all loans are graded or risk rated individually for loss potential at the time of origination and as warranted thereafter  but no less frequently than quarterly 
loss potential factors are applied based upon a blend of the following criteria our own direct experience at this bank  our collective management experience in administering similar loan portfolios in the market for nearly years  and peer data contained in statistical releases issued by both the comptroller and the fdic 
although looking only at peer data and the bank s historically low write offs would suggest a lower loan loss allowance  our management s experience with similar portfolios in the same market combined with the fact that our portfolio is relatively unseasoned  justify a conservative approach in contemplating external statistical resources 
accordingly  management s collective experience at this bank and other banks is the most heavily weighted criterion  and the weighting is subjective and varies by loan type  amount  collateral  structure  and repayment terms 
prevailing economic conditions generally and within each individual borrower s business sector are considered  as well as any changes in the borrower s own financial position and  in the case of commercial loans  management structure and business operations 
when deterioration develops in an individual credit  the loan is placed on a watch list and the loan is monitored more closely 
all loans on the watch list are evaluated for specific loss potential based upon either an evaluation of the liquidated value of the collateral or cash flow deficiencies 
if management believes that  with respect to a specific loan  an impaired source of repayment  collateral impairment or a change in a debtor s financial condition presents a heightened risk of non performance of a particular loan  a portion of the reserve may be specifically allocated to that individual loan 
the aggregation of this loan by loan loss analysis comprises the specific reserve 
the unallocated reserve is maintained to absorb risk factors outside of the general and specific allocations 
maximum and minimum target limits  currently of total loans  are established by us on a quarterly basis for the unallocated reserve 
in addition to the reserves discussed above  the mortgage corporation maintains a separate reserve in other liabilities for lhfs and potential early default penalties 
at december  the balance in this reserve totaled approximately thousand

when a loan is placed on non accrual  unpaid interest is reversed against interest income 
subsequent receipts on non accrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
the loss potential for each loan has been evaluated and in management s opinion the risk of loss is adequately reserved against

non interest bearing demand deposits totaled million at year end our non interest bearing demand deposits are predominately commercial and subject to wide fluctuations which accounts for the decline in this category at year end 
average deposits for totaled million compared to in  an increase of million 
the increase in average deposits is primarily due to the expansion of our customer base 
we offer a full line of competitive deposit products that have varying rates and terms 
our deposits are primarily from our local market 
professional loan officers are responsible for marketing both loans and deposits 
our primary focus with respect to core deposit growth is upon the business deposits in our market 
we plan to strengthen our sales staff by adding personnel  and we continue to use direct marketing and traditional media advertising 
the opening of our new offices in leesburg and manassas are expected to contribute to the growth in deposits in our customer service focus is mainly on our business and professional customers  which usually generate more referrals for additional new business than do retail account holders 
time deposits represent of total deposits  up from of total deposits on december  time deposits increased by over december  due to higher  more competitive interest rates

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in was million  up from thousand in the increase in the provision for loan losses is due in part to the increase in loans held for investment and the continuous credit risk assessment of the portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio based on the evaluation as of december  the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense in was thousand down from million in the decrease in the provision for loan losses is due to the reallocation of thousand in specific reserves relating to non performing loans that were upgraded to performing loan status in non interest income non interest income consists of revenue generated from a broad range of financial services and activities 
the mortgage corporation provides the most significant contributions towards non interest income 
total non interest income was million in compared to million in gains on the sale of loans totaled million in compared to million in mortgage broker fees amounted to million in down from million in other income  comprised primarily of miscellaneous loan fees  totaled million in compared to million in the volume of our mortgage corporation is subject to many cyclical risks against which we actively manage 
volume and the accompanying non interest income are subject to the risks associated with the general interest rate environment as well as the new home and resale activity of the residential real estate market in the communities we serve 
total non interest income was million in  down million from million in primarily due to a decrease in gains on the sale of loans originated by the mortgage corporation 
gains on the sale of loans totaled million in compared to million in this decrease is due to a general compression of margins available in the market place as well as an increase in wholesale loan originations which generally have lower margins than retail loan originations 
mortgage broker fees amounted to million in down  from million in  as fewer loans were brokered 
non interest expense non interest expense totaled million in up million from million in occupancy expense increased thousand primarily as a result of rent increases and the addition of two new banking offices 
other operating expense accounted for approximately million of the total increase 
note to the consolidated financial statements details the changes in other operating expense 
non interest expense totaled million in down million from million in salaries and benefits totaled million  a decrease of million from million in the decrease in salaries and benefits is due to a decrease in commissions at the mortgage corporation

liquidity management involves maintaining the corporation s ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of both depositors and borrowers 
asset and liability management functions not only serve to assure adequate liquidity in order to meet the needs of the corporation s customers  but also to maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities so that the corporation can earn an appropriate return for its shareholders 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments and maturities of investment securities 
other short term investments such as federal funds sold and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding 
at december   overnight interest bearing balances totaled million and securities available for sale net of restricted stock totaled million 
the liability portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity through various interest bearing and non interest bearing deposit accounts  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase and other short term borrowings 
at december   the corporation had a line of credit with the fhlb totaling million and outstanding variable rate loans of million  and an additional million in term loans at fixed rates ranging from to leaving million available on the line 
in addition to the line of credit at the fhlb and its mortgage subsidiary also issue repurchase agreements and commercial paper 
as of december   outstanding repurchase agreements totaled million and commercial paper issued amounted to million 
the interest rate on these instruments is variable and subject to change daily 
the bank also maintains federal funds lines of credit with its correspondent banks and  at december   these lines amounted to million 
the corporation also has million in subordinated debentures to support the growth of the organization 
the corporation funded the growth in interest earning assets through a combination of deposits  retention of earnings and borrowed funds 
the corporation expects its short and long term sources of liquidity and capital to remain adequate to support expected growth 
the bank relies on a variety of short and long term resources for liquidity from a variety of sources that substantially reduces reliance upon any single provider

these commitments do not necessarily represent cash requirements  since many commitments are expected to expire without being drawn on 
at december  the bank had approximately million in unfunded lines and letters of credit 
these lines of credit  if drawn upon  would be funded from routine cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s market risk is composed primarily of interest rate risk 
the funds management committee is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position and establishes policies to monitor and coordinate the corporation s sources  uses and pricing of funds 
interest rate sensitivity management the corporation uses a simulation model to analyze  manage and formulate operating strategies that address net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a twelve month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and re pricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumption of certain assets and liabilities as of december  the model assumes changes in interest rates without any management intervention to change the composition of the balance sheet 
the table below reflects the outcome of these analyses at december  according to the model run for the period ended december  over a twelve month period  an immediate basis points increase in interest rates would result in an increase in net interest income by 
an immediate basis points decline in interest rates would result in a decrease in net interest income by 
while management carefully monitors the exposure to changes in interest rates and takes actions as warranted to decrease any adverse impact  there can be no assurance about the actual effect of interest rate changes on net interest income 
rate shock analysis december  change in hypothetical hypothetical percentage federal funds percentage change change in economic target rate in earnings value of equity the corporation s net interest income and the fair value of its financial instruments are influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
the corporation manages its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies established by its funds management committee 
the funds management committee meets periodically and has responsibility for formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the mortgage corporation is party to mortgage rate lock commitments to fund mortgage loans at interest rates previously agreed locked by both the corporation and the borrower for specified periods of time 
when the borrower locks their interest rate  the corporation effectively extends a put option to the borrower  whereby the borrower is not obligated to enter into the loan agreement  but the corporation must honor the interest rate for the specified time period 
the corporation is exposed to interest rate risk during the accumulation of interest rate lock commitments and loans prior to sale 
the corporation utilizes either a best efforts sell forward or a mandatory sell forward commitment to economically hedge the changes in fair value of the loan due to changes in market interest rates 
failure to effectively monitor  manage and hedge the interest rate risk associated with the mandatory commitments subjects the corporation to potentially significant market risk 
throughout the lock period the changes in the market value of interest rate lock commitments  best efforts and mandatory sell forward commitments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses and are included in the statement of operations in mortgage revenue 
the corporation s management has made complex judgments in the recognition of gains and losses in connection with this activity 
the corporation utilizes a third party and its proprietary simulation model to assist in identifying and managing the risk associated with this activity 
impact of inflation and changing prices a bank s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of a non financial company in that virtually all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation on financial results depends upon the bank s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as the prices of other goods and services 
management seeks to manage the relationship between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
