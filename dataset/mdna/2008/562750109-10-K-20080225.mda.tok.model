application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we believe that estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between those estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions which we have identified as our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill  accounting for income taxes  stock based compensation  and business combinations 
revenue recognition our revenue consists of revenues from the licensing and hosting of software  fees from implementation and training services collectively  professional services  plus customer support services and software enhancements  and sales of hardware and other other consists of reimbursements of out of pocket expenses incurred by professional services 
all revenue is recognized net of any related sales taxes 
we recognize license revenue under statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop  specifically when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the product has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
sop requires recognition of revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for 
table of contents using long term contract accounting  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement  and all revenue recognition criteria in sop  other than the requirement for vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of each delivered element of the arrangement are satisfied 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized using contract accounting 
the accounting related to license revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules which are subject to change 
our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
our services revenue consists of fees generated from professional services  customer support services and software enhancements related to our software products 
fees from professional services performed by us are generally billed on an hourly basis  and revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
professional services are sometimes rendered under agreements in which billings are limited to contractual maximums or based upon a fixed fee for portions of or all of the engagement 
revenue related to fixed fee based contracts is recognized on a proportional performance basis based on the hours incurred on discrete projects within an overall services arrangement 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period in which they become known 
revenue related to customer support services and software enhancements are generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  typically months 
hardware and other revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured by third parties that are integrated with and complementary to our software solutions 
as part of a complete solution  our customers periodically purchase hardware from us in conjunction with the licensing of software 
these products include computer hardware  radio frequency terminal networks  radio frequency identification rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
hardware revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer when title passes 
we generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer 
as a result  we do not maintain significant hardware inventory 
in accordance with the financial accounting standard board s fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  we recognize amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue 
such amounts have been included in hardware and other revenue 
the total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to revenue was million  million and million and for   and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credits based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts generally represent a sales allowance on services revenue  which are recorded to operations as a reduction to services revenue 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
our goodwill is subject to an annual impairment test  which requires us to estimate the fair value of our business compared to the carrying value 
the impairment reviews require an analysis of future projections and assumptions about our operating performance 
should such review indicate the assets are impaired  we would record an expense for the impaired assets 

table of contents annual tests or other future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill is impaired 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believed was impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
at december   our goodwill balance was million 
accounting for income taxes we provide for the effect of income taxes on our financial position and results of operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this accounting pronouncement  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of income taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the change in net deferred tax assets or liabilities resulting from events that are recorded for financial reporting purposes in a different reporting period than recorded in the tax return 
management must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our net deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws  allowable deductions  projected tax credits and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial position and results of operations 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of our net deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase of million in the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and recorded a corresponding deferred tax asset for future benefits of million  with the net amount of million accounted for as a decrease to the january  balance of retained earnings 
as of the date of adoption and after the impact of recognizing the increase in liability noted above  our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million  of which million  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for our employee stock option plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based employee compensation cost related to stock options was recognized in the statements of income for periods prior to january   as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r for stock based compensation 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  our income before income taxes for and was million and million lower  respectively  and net income for and was million and million lower  respectively than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
basic and diluted earnings per share were and lower in  respectively  and each lower in than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
we estimate the fair value of options granted on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
we base our estimate of fair value on certain assumptions  including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option  the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
we base our expected volatilities on a combination of the historical volatility of our stock and the implied volatility of publicly traded options issued by third party for our common stock 
due to the limited trading volume of publicly traded options for our common stock  we place a greater emphasis on historical volatility of our common stock 
we 
table of contents also use historical data to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding and the forfeiture rate of options granted 
we base the risk free interest rate on the rate for us treasury zero coupon issues with a term approximating the expected term 
we recognize compensation cost for awards with graded vesting using the straight line attribution method  with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
compensation cost recognized in any period is impacted by the number of stock options granted and the vesting period which generally is four years  as well as the underlying assumptions used in estimating the fair value on the date of grant 
this estimate is dependent upon a number of variables such as the number of options awarded  cancelled or exercised and fluctuations in our share price during the year 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts and acquired developed technologies  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with purchase price allocations  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts  when and if available upgrades  or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
recent accounting developments adoption of sfas no 
r 
prior to january   we accounted for our employee stock option plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
no stock based employee compensation cost related to stock options was recognized in the statements of income for periods prior to january   as all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized on or after january  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for all prior periods have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r requires that cash flows resulting from the tax benefits generated by tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 

table of contents as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january   our income before income taxes for and was million and million lower  respectively  and net income for and was million and million lower  respectively than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
basic and diluted earnings per share were and lower in and each measure was lower in than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
the fair value of options granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model based on certain assumptions  including the expected term of the option  the expected volatility of the price of the underlying share for the expected term of the option  the expected dividends on the underlying share for the expected term  and the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option 
effective january   expected volatilities are based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock 
due to the limited trading volume of publicly traded options for our common stock  we place a greater emphasis on historical volatility of our common stock 
previously  we had relied exclusively on historical volatility  disregarding periods of time in which our share price was extraordinarily volatile because of company specific circumstances that were not expected to recur 
we also use historical data to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding and the forfeiture rate of options granted 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury zero coupon issues with a term approximating the expected term 
the weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during   and was   and  respectively 
we recognize compensation cost for awards with graded vesting using the straight line attribution method  with the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that is vested at that date 
at december   the unamortized compensation cost related to stock option awards totaled million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
in  our shareholders approved a new stock incentive plan 
in conjunction with the adoption of the new plan  the company lowered its annual stock options granted by approximately and began to issue restricted stock awards  consequently stock option expense decreased million in and restricted stock expense increased million 
during the fourth quarter of  the board of directors approved an option acceleration agreement that accelerated the vesting of unvested stock options held by our employees with an exercise price of or higher 
the accelerated vesting affected options for approximately option holders  representing million shares of our common stock 
in order to prevent unintended personal benefits to individuals resulting from the accelerated vesting of options  we imposed sales restrictions on shares acquired upon exercise of these options that parallel the vesting requirements of the original options 
these sales restrictions on the shares acquired continue following termination of employment until the original vesting dates are reached 
the accelerated vesting of these stock options with exercise prices greater than the then current market value referred to as out of the money or underwater options was made primarily to avoid recognizing compensation expense in our future income statements upon the adoption of sfas no 
r for underwater options that we believed would not offer a sufficient incentive to our employees when compared to the future compensation expense that we would have incurred under sfas no 
r 
compensation cost recognized in any period is impacted by the number of stock options granted and the vesting period which generally is four years  as well as the underlying assumptions used in estimating the fair value on the date of grant 
this estimate is dependent upon a number of variables such as the number of options awarded  cancelled or exercised and fluctuations in our share price during the year 
adoption of fin on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase of million in the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and recorded a corresponding deferred tax asset for future benefits of million  with the net amount of million accounted for as a decrease to the january  balance of retained earnings 
as of the date of adoption and after the impact of recognizing the increase in liability noted above  our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million  of which million  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
acquisition

evant is a provider of demand planning and forecasting and replenishment 
table of contents solutions to customers in the retail  manufacturing and distribution industries 
the acquisition further diversified our product suite and expands our customer base 
we paid an aggregate of million in cash  and incurred million in acquisition costs and million of severance to eliminate duplicative functions 
the million includes million of bonuses paid to employees not retained by us pursuant to an employee bonus plan approved by evant s management 
in addition to the million cash paid  we paid million into escrow at closing for employee retention purposes pursuant to the evant bonus plan to be distributed to employees upon completion of up to months of service with us 
the million was recorded as a prepaid asset  and compensation expense was recognized ratably over the required employee retention period 
during the third quarter of  we completed the evant retention bonus program and paid out the final bonuses 
the acquisition of evant was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the operating results of evant are included in our financial statements beginning september  during  we completed the analysis of the post acquisition limitations on the use of evant s deferred tax assets 
as a result  we recorded million of deferred tax assets and reduced goodwill mainly for deductible research and development costs previously capitalized by evant for tax purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign business our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our international operations currently include business activity out of offices in the united kingdom  the netherlands  germany  france  australia  japan  china  singapore and india 
when the us dollar strengthens against a foreign currency  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the value of our sales and expenses in that currency converted to us dollars increases

investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates  or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates
