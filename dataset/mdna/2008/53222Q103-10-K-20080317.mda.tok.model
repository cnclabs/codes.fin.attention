critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and with the instructions to form k and article of regulation s x 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company evaluates these estimates including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for sales returns and allowances and customer chargebacks  inventory mark down provisions  impairment of tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill  stock option expense and accruals related to the company s tax positions 
actual results may differ from these estimates using different assumptions and under different conditions 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
inventory inventory consists principally of finished goods sourced from third party suppliers 
inventory also includes finished goods  work in process and raw materials related to the company s manufacture of sterling silver products 
inventory is priced by the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market method 
consistent with the seasonality of the company s business  inventory generally increases  beginning late in the first quarter of the year  and reaches a peak at the end of the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter  and declines thereafter 
the company periodically reviews and analyzes inventory based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  future product demand for items and estimated profitability of merchandise 
when appropriate  the company writes down inventory to net realizable value 
revenue recognition the company sells products wholesale to retailers and distributors and retail  direct to the consumer through the company s factory and outlet store  catalog and internet operations 
wholesale sales are recognized when title passes to and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer 
factory and outlet store sales are recognized at the time of sale while catalog and internet sales are recognized upon receipt by the customer 
shipping and handling fees that are billed to customers in sales transactions are recorded in net sales 
net sales exclude taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to the taxing authorities 
receivables the company periodically reviews the collectibility of its accounts receivable and establishes allowances for estimated losses that could result from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of these receivables including assessing the credit worthiness of each wholesale customer 
the company also maintains an allowance for sales returns and customer chargebacks 
to evaluate the adequacy of the sales returns and customer chargeback allowances the company analyzes currently available information and historical trends 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or the company s estimate of sales returns was determined to be inadequate  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over their respective useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such amounts may have been impaired 
impairment indicators include among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit or material adverse changes in the business climate that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired 
when impairment indicators are present  the company compares the carrying value of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
employee stock options effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that the expense resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r also requires that excess tax benefits associated with share based payments be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows  rather than as operating cash flows as required by previous accounting standards 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
the company values stock options using the black scholes option valuation model 
however  the black scholes option valuation model  as well as other available models  were developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
because the company s stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not provide a reliable measure of the fair value of its stock options
