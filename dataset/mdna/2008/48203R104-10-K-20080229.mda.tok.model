words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this report under the section entitled risk factors in item a of part i and elsewhere  and in other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission sec  specifically the most recent reports on form q 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in the course of operating our business  we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices  the collection of receivables  the manufacturing and shipment of products  the fulfillment of orders  the purchase of supplies  and the building of inventory and spare parts  among other matters 
each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period 
in making these decisions  we consider various factors including contractual obligations  customer satisfaction  competition  internal and external financial targets and expectations  and financial planning objectives 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  pricing credits  warranty costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges  assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to aid in understanding our operating results for the periods covered by this report  we have provided an executive overview and a summary of the significant events that affected the most recent fiscal year and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses 
these sections should be read in conjunction with the more detailed discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this item  our risk factors section included in item a of part i  and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in item of part ii of this report 

table of contents executive overview our performance was the result of a combination of strong market demand for networking and security products as well as our focused execution and market share gains 
in addition  we began shipment of several new products which contributed to our revenue growth during the year 
during  we also implemented a series of operational excellence initiatives 
these initiatives are intended to strengthen the management systems and processes throughout our organization to support our growth

service revenue increased million  or  to million in  compared to infrastructure product  slt product and service revenues represented  and of our total net revenues  respectively  for our revenue performance and share gains were driven by infrastructure product and slt product sales 
infrastructure product revenue increased million  or  in as compared to primarily attributable to revenue growth in our m and t series routers  as well as our recently introduced mx series routers 
slt product revenue increased in as compared to primarily attributable to the increased sales of our firewall virtual private network firewall products  including our recently introduced ssgm and ssgm firewall appliances  and to a lesser extent  increases in secure socket layer virtual private network ssl  j series  and wan optimization products 
service revenue increased in over the prior year primarily due to the increase in our installed base of equipment under service contracts and  to a lesser extent  growth in professional service revenue 
new infrastructure products shipped in include the t router and our mx series product family 
our t product is a high capacity and energy efficient core router 
our mx series family of ethernet service routers enables service providers to deliver advance services including iptv and video on demand at scale 
the mx series includes mx  a large capacity and high density carrier ethernet platform  and mx  which began shipping in the fourth quarter of new slt products introduced in include the ssgm and ssgm products  which are purpose built appliances that deliver high performance and secure connectivity for regional and branch office 
we also introduced new products within the j series service router family  such as j and j  which are designed to enable enterprises to accelerate the secure delivery of business critical applications across their networks 
additionally  we continued to make enhancements and design updates to other slt product families during

operating margin operating income increased  million to million in  compared to an operating loss of million in operating margin was in as compared to in the increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to decreases in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
such decreases were largely due to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges of  million in and the absence of such charges in additionally  to a lesser extent  operating margin improved due to the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue as well as decreases in other charges associated with our internal stock option investigation  partially offset by increases in research and development expenses in as compared to net income and net income per share net income was million  or per share on a diluted basis  in  compared to a net loss of  million  or per share on a diluted basis  in the increases in were primarily attributable to the goodwill and intangible impairment charges of  million in that were absent in as well as the revenue growth and an increase in operating margin as discussed above

we maintained a strong position in the infrastructure product business and gained share in key market segments 
we also experienced an increased interest in our slt portfolio due to increased network demand from our enterprise customers as well as growth from service providers using our slt products for both managed service offerings and outsourced solutions for their customers 
additionally  we continued our momentum in the enterprise market for our slt products as well as routing products portfolio 
we now serve over of the fortune companies and more than  enterprise customers worldwide 
in addition  over out of the state governments in the united states have deployed our technologies 
we believe our innovation and market momentum have enabled us to maintain relationships with our partners  including strategic resellers alcatel lucent  ericsson  inc  and nokia siemens networks bv nsn  while developing broader relationships with technology leaders such as international business machines corporation ibm and microsoft corporation to better serve our customers 
stock repurchase activity we repurchased and retired million common shares  at an average price of per share for a total of  million as part of our billion common stock repurchase program approved by our board in july and february the stock repurchase program 
as of december   our stock repurchase program had a remaining authorization of million for repurchases 
see note in item for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in stock option investigation and amendment of certain stock options in  we completed the restatement of our historical financial statements as a result of our independent stock option investigation and review of historical stock compensation practices 
in addition  we regained compliance with listing standards of the nasdaq global select market 
we recorded million in operating 
table of contents expenses during in connection with this stock option investigation  compared to million and nil in and  respectively 
in april  we completed a tender offer to amend certain options granted under the juniper networks  inc amended restated stock plan and the juniper networks  inc nonstatutory stock option plan that had original exercise prices per share that were less than the fair market value per share of the common stock underlying the option on the option s grant date  as determined by us for financial accounting purposes 
under this tender offer  employees subject to taxation in the united states and canada had the opportunity to increase their strike price on affected options to the appropriate fair market value per share on the date of grant so as to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under united states internal revenue code section a a issue or canadian tax laws and regulations 
in exchange for increasing the strike price of these options  we committed to make a cash payment to employees participating in the offer so as to make these employees whole for the incremental strike price as compared to their original option exercise price 
in connection with the offer  we amended options to purchase million shares of our common stock in and made aggregate cash payments of million to offer participants in january we accrued this aggregate payment liability and recognized an operating expense for the corresponding amount during settlement with the securities and exchange commission on august   we announced that the commissioners of the sec authorized the settlement between us and the sec regarding the previously disclosed sec inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices 
without admitting or denying the allegations in the sec s complaint  we agreed to settle the charges by consenting to a permanent injunction against any future violations of the antifraud  reporting  books and records and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws 
no monetary penalties were assessed against us in conjunction with this settlement 
this settlement concludes the sec s formal investigation of the company with respect to our historical stock option granting practices 
adoption of fin we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin on january   the first day of fiscal under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
the cumulative effect of applying fin was a million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of january  and a million increase to goodwill 
as of the date of adoption  the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was million  of which million  if recognized  would affect our effective tax rate 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
this policy did not change as a result of the adoption of fin we accrued interest expense and penalties of million within other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of the date of adoption 
we conduct business globally and  as a result  we or one or more of our subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions 
in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world  including such major jurisdictions as ireland  hong kong  uk  france  germany  the netherlands  japan  china  australia  and the us with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us federal  state and local  or non us income tax examinations for years before  although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to may still be adjusted upon examination by the irs if the attributes either have been or will be used in a future period 

table of contents nature of expenses most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers 
accordingly  most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs 
the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs and standards that we establish 
controls around manufacturing  engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california and westford  massachusetts 
our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in canada  china  malaysia  and the united states 
we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 
the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts  we may be  and have been in the past  liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 
we have employees in our manufacturing and operations organization who manage relationships with our contract manufacturers  manage our supply chain  and monitor product testing and quality 
employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  vacation  benefits  stock based compensation and travel 
we had   and  employees as of december    and  respectively 
the year over year increases were primarily attributable to increases in our research and development  sales and customer service activities 
our headcount is expected to increase in as we continue to expand these functions 
we accounted for stock based compensation under the fair value approach of fas r in and in  we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value approach of apb details of our stock based compensation expense are described in note and note in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount 
these departmental costs have increased in and due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from infrastructure systems added to support our growth and past acquisitions 
facility and information technology related headcount was   and as of december    and  respectively 
in  we expect to further invest in our company wide information technology infrastructure as we implement our operational excellence initiatives 
our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
changes in related currency exchange rates may affect our operating results 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates 
any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments is reported in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
the increase in operating expenses including research and development  sales and marketing  as well as general and administrative expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations  net of hedging  was approximately in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and  in certain instances  sales contracts or agreements 
shipping terms and related documents  or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery or performance 
in instances where we have outstanding obligations related to product delivery or the final acceptance of the product  revenue is deferred until all the delivery and acceptance criteria have been met 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer s payment history to us 
accounts receivable are recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts  estimated customer returns and pricing credits 
for arrangements with multiple elements  such as sales of products that include services  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
under the residual method  the amount of revenue allocated to delivered elements equals the total arrangement consideration less the aggregate fair value of any undelivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of one or more undelivered items does not exist  revenue is deferred and recognized at the earlier of i delivery of those elements or ii when fair value can be established unless maintenance is the only undelivered element  in which case  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the contractual support period 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 
for sales to direct end users and value added resellers  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller 
for our end users and value added resellers  there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors 
deferred revenue on shipments to distributors reflects the effects of distributor pricing credits and the amount of gross margin expected to be realized upon sell through 
deferred revenue is recorded net of the related product costs of revenue 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as rebates and price protection  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
in addition  we report revenue net of sales taxes 
services include maintenance  training and professional services 
maintenance is offered under renewable contracts 
revenue from maintenance service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one to three years 
revenue from training and professional services is recognized as the services are completed or ratably over the contractual period  which is generally one year or less 
we sell certain interests in accounts receivables as part of a distributor accounts receivable financing arrangement which was established by us with a major financing company 
accounts receivables sold under 
table of contents this arrangement in advance of revenue recognition are accounted for as debt and were million and nil as of december  and  respectively 
contract manufacturer liabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts 
these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products  which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
we establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers  such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures  which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
warranty reserve 
we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or iv failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of november or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we use the market approach as well as the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fas no 
r beginning in under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
in conjunction with the adoption of fas r  we also adopted the single approach method for valuing our stock based awards as well as the straight line method for amortizing the related stock based compensation expense under the modified prospective approach 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 

table of contents income taxes 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under fas  accounting for income taxes  and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
on january   we adopted fin fin is an interpretation of fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position that an entity takes or expects to take in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
under fin  an entity may only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
in addition  the application of fin may increase an entity s future effective tax rates and its future intra period effective tax rate volatility 
our cumulative effect of applying fin was a million increase to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of january  and a million increase to goodwill 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
in addition  from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters  however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and these actions or other third party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional expenses 

table of contents results of operations net revenues the following table shows total net product and service revenues and net product and service revenues as a percentage of total net revenues in millions  except percentages years ended december  years ended december  change change change change net revenues product percentage of net revenues service percentage of net revenues total net revenues our total net revenues increased million  or to  million in as compared to our total net revenues increased million  or to  million in as compared to the increases in both years were primarily due to the demand growth in the markets we serve 
in addition  we gained market share in several areas and capitalized on the opportunities in our targeted markets with our new and existing product and service offerings during net product revenues our net product revenue increased million  or  from to  million in the increase was the result of increased activity in both infrastructure product and slt product sales to service provider and enterprise markets 
in particular we had success in selling our products to customers who are adopting ngn ip networks  which are designed to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network 
in addition  we had a number of new product releases and expanded into new emerging markets during net product revenue grew million  or from to  the majority of which was generated from our slt product revenue growth in the following table shows total net product revenues and net product revenues as a percentage of total net revenues by product category in millions  except percentages years ended december  years ended december  change change change change net product revenues infrastructure percentage of net revenues slt percentage of net revenues total net product revenues infrastructure product revenues infrastructure product revenues accounted for  million  or  of total net revenues  and increased million  or  in  compared to we benefited from the strong worldwide demand for high performance router products as our service provider customers seek simplified  scalable network infrastructures across fiber  cable and mobile access technologies to support increasing performance demands on their networks 
the infrastructure product revenue increase in was primarily attributable to increased revenue from our m  t  and 
table of contents mx series router products driven by our service provider customers continued build out of ngn as their bandwidth requirement increases 
our service provider customers also moved towards ngns designed to enable a fast and cost effective deployment of differentiating multi play services that allow them to generate new sources of revenue 
also contributing to the revenue growth was an increase in infrastructure product sales to the content service provider and the enterprise markets 
from a geographical perspective  we experienced strength in the americas region 
we also experienced revenue increases in apac and emea 
infrastructure products accounted for  million  or  of our total net revenues during and  million  or  of our total net revenues during infrastructure product net revenue grew by million  or  from to primarily due to continued success from a very significant year of growth in  which strengthened our position as a supplier to the largest service providers in the world  particularly in the americas and in emea 
we experienced revenue growth in higher end infrastructure chassis products and increased penetration by our core and edge router portfolio as service providers acquired products for their ngns and multi play service offerings 
this growth was partially offset by a pause in the build out of ngns and associated purchase decisions  particularly in japan  as major carriers prepare for the next stage of bandwidth and services expansion  and a large product revenue deferral as of december  for products shipped to one of our largest customers 
we track infrastructure chassis revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth 
our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media 
the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port 
the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 
chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on which revenue was recognized during the period 
the following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped years ended december  years ended december  unit change change unit change change infrastructure chassis revenue units infrastructure ports shipped chassis revenue units increased from to as our customers expanded the capacity in their existing networks 
the increase was mainly due to the introduction of the mx series products  which are our carrier ethernet base routers 
we also experienced growth in our m and t series products  driven by bandwidth demand as service provider customers sought to expand voice and video capability in their existing networks 
port shipment units increased by in as compared to the increase was associated with the growth in chassis revenue units with larger expansion capacity and the customers need to differentiate themselves by providing feature rich multi play services 
chassis revenue units slightly increased from to due primarily to the sales of higher end t series and m series products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a acquisition  partially offset by decreases in sales of lower end e series and m series products 
sales of higher end chassis units increased as our customers continued to adopt and expand ip networks in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network 
port shipment units increased from to primarily due to the increase in port demands driven by the larger expansion capacity in the higher end chassis revenue units shipped during  partially offset by the lower port capacity in the ctp series chassis revenue units 
slt product revenues slt product revenues accounted for of total net revenues and increased million  or  to million in  compared to the revenue increase was due to sales increases across the majority of the slt product families particularly the firewall  ssl  wan optimization and j series products 
our customers 
table of contents demands for slt products grew due to their increasing focus on addressing the risks associated with connecting and delivering critical network services and business applications 
the integrated systems introduced prior to  such as the isg and ssg firewall products  gained traction in the market place and generated additional revenue in the revenue increase from our ssl products was due to our deployments of ssl solutions to enterprises and governments who were seeking to enhance their remote access to data and applications 
we experienced considerable improvement in revenue from our wan optimization application acceleration platforms as customers sought to boost the responsiveness of their networks 
all three geographic regions had significant growth in slt sales during we experienced a growing demand for our slt products in both the enterprise and service provider markets as we focused on cross selling more integrated products and solutions in the enterprise and service provider markets while leveraging partnerships with open standards based interoperability of our slt products 
in addition  we benefited from typical fourth quarter seasonality 
we generally experienced seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our slt products  which may result in greater variations in our quarterly revenue 
in january  we announced a plan to phase out our dx product line 
these products will be supported until we do not expect this plan to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
slt products accounted for million  or  of our total net revenues in and million  or  of total net revenues during slt product net revenue increased million  or  from to due to a growing demand and brand recognition for our slt products from large enterprises and the us federal government 
sales increased across various slt product families including firewalls  idp  j series  dx  and ssl 
in addition  the new products announced in and the dx and application acceleration products added to our portfolio through the various acquisitions in contributed to this increase 
in addition  we experienced success in cross selling slt products to service providers for both their own it infrastructure and resale built upon the acquisitions we completed in a further part of the increase was due to successfully selling to much larger enterprise customers with increased footprint and complexity 
the following table shows slt revenue units recognized years ended december  years ended december  unit change change unit change change service layer technologies units slt product units increased in as compared to primarily attributable to the growing demand for our slt products in the market place 
the increase in the number of slt units was greater than the revenue increase of primarily due to the increased revenue from sales of our branch firewall products  which have lower average selling price than other slt products 
slt product units increased while slt product revenue increased in as compared to primarily due to sales of high end firewalls 
net service revenues net service revenues increased million  or  to million in  compared to  and represent of net revenues 
the growth in service revenue was primarily driven by increased technical support service contracts associated with higher infrastructure and slt product sales  which have resulted in increased renewals and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced 
installed base is calculated by each customer based on the number of systems that the customers has under maintenance 
a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into maintenance contracts that are generally for one year renewable periods 
we also have multi year maintenance contracts 
these contracts are typically for services such as hour customer support  non specified updates and hardware repairs 
we recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation 
in addition to support services and professional services  we also provide educational services 
consistent with  support service revenues represents of net service revenues in to a lesser extent  professional services also contributed to the growth in net service revenues in professional service revenue increased primarily due to large customer deployments requiring consulting services 

table of contents net service revenues increased million  or  from to primarily due to the growth in support services driven by an increase in the installed base that we are servicing  as well as increased attach rates on new product sales  improved enterprise service infrastructure allowing more rapid implementation of services and the addition of new professional service offerings 
professional service revenue also increased  to a lesser extent  in compared to due primarily to maintenance related on site engineering services as well as additional consulting projects in total net revenues by geographic region the following table shows total net revenues by geographic region in millions  except percentages years ended december  years ended december  change change change change americas united states other total americas percentage of net revenues europe  middle east and africa percentage of net revenue asia pacific percentage of net revenues total prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation

net revenues in the americas region increased million  or  to  million in as compared to the americas region represented of net revenues in  an increase of percentage points over the increases were largely due to strength in the united states and in latin america 
net revenue from the united states increased million in compared to  primarily due to revenue growth in the infrastructure product segment from our service provider and internet content provider customers and  to a lesser extent  slt product and service segments 
net revenues from latin america increased million in  compared to  primarily due to strength in brazil driven by sales to a major local carrier 
total revenue recorded by the americas region grew by million from its level and remained at approximately of worldwide revenue  as compared to  due to significant success in the united states and with the main service providers in canada and various south american countries including brazil and argentina 
net revenue in the united states increased by million in from due to continued success both with enterprise customers such as the us federal government  as well as with major service providers in the united states 
the increase was also due in part to sales to major internet content providers and cable providers 
this success was partially offset by a significant product revenue deferral for products shipped to one of our largest customers 
net revenue in americas as a percentage of total net revenue decreased slightly in compared to as a result of the strong growth in emea 
net revenue in the emea region increased million  or  to million in  compared to  due to increased infrastructure product and slt product revenues along with increased service revenue driven by strong bandwidth demands in the region

nsn accounted for greater than of our net product and service revenues for the years ended december    and we expect that our largest customers  as well as key strategic partners  will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenues in cost of revenues the following table shows cost of product and service revenues and the related gross margin gm percentages in millions  except percentages years ended december  years ended december  change change change change cost of revenues product gm percentage of revenue service gm percentage of revenue total cost of revenues gm percentage of revenue cost of product revenues product gross margin improved from in to in the slight increase in product gross margin was mainly due to favorable product mix and  to a lesser extent  improvements in standard costs of our infrastructure products  partially offset by a slight decrease in our slt product gross margin 
the improvement of standard costs as a percentage of product revenue was primarily due to our increased purchases from contract manufacturers and suppliers in lower cost regions 
as of december  and  we employed and people  respectively  in our manufacturing and operations organization 
these personnel manage relationships with our contract manufacturers  manage our supply chain  and monitor product testing and quality 
infrastructure product gross margin percentages improved slightly in compared to our infrastructure chassis revenue units increased while our infrastructure ports shipped increased during  on a year over year basis  compared to the infrastructure product revenues increase of for the year 
we experienced a favorable product mix and derived a larger portion of revenues from richly configured high end m series and t series router products 
we also generated revenues from high margin port shipments  which are add on components to the chassis routers 
the increases in chassis units and port shipments were driven by bandwidth demand as customers are seeking to expand capabilities in their networks and to offer differentiating feature rich multi play services that allow them to generate new revenue sources 
see further details in the infrastructure product revenues section 

table of contents the gross margin improvement from infrastructure products was offset by a slight decrease in our slt product gross margin in the decrease in slt product gross margin was primarily due to product mix  particularly from an increase in the mix of lower margin branch firewall and j series products in in addition  higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex products were also impacting slt gross margin 
the higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized the benefit of our cost reduction efforts of moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions

the increase in stock compensation expense in cost of product revenue from to of million was primarily due to the impact of adopting fas r on january  product gross margins tend to fluctuate due to changes in the mix of products sold and our gross margins may be impacted as we introduce new products and manage production costs among multiple contract manufacturers or when our customers change the timing of their purchases 
we will continue to seek reductions in our production costs as we enter into new markets  including markets with different pricing structures and cost structures 
our margins are impacted by changes in distribution channels and price competition as well as changes in the geographic mix of our sales 
sales discounts  warranty costs  changes in shipment volume  loss of cost savings due to changes in component pricing also impact gross margins 
these factors  combined with how well we execute on our strategy and operating plans  may lead to margin variability 
cost of service revenues cost of service revenues increased million  or  to million in as compared to service gross margin decreased by less than one percentage point to in as compared to the increase in service costs and the decrease in gross margin were primarily attributable to increases in headcount related expenses associated with expanding our service delivery infrastructure and professional service organization  particularly in north america and in india  as well as increasing our resources for supporting network build outs and deployments by our customers

infrastructure management operating income increased million  or  from to million in due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth 
our increase in revenue was partially offset by our continued investments in research and development efforts as we seek to continue our innovation of products and expand our infrastructure product portfolio 
we also allocate sales and marketing  general and administrative  as well as facility and information technology expenses to the infrastructure segment generally based on headcount and revenue 
in  our sales and marketing expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenues but increased in absolute dollars as we increased our efforts to reach enterprise and service provider customers 
we will continue to make these investments to expand our product features and functionality based upon the trends in the market place 
infrastructure management operating income decreased million  or  from to million in primarily due to higher personnel related costs associated with our investments in product innovation for next generation core and edge infrastructure products as well as increased operating expenses associated with marketing related efforts and improvements to our internal infrastructure  partially offset by savings in sales expense during as we increasingly leveraged our existing distribution channel 
slt operating segment an analysis of the change in revenue for the slt segment  and the change in units  can be found in the section titled net revenues 

table of contents slt management operating loss increased million  or  from to million in due to product mix and increases in manufacturing related costs 
the loss was primarily due to our effort to build a foundation to help enable future slt revenue growth and due to slight decreases in the slt product gross margins 
the increase in slt operating expenses was due in large part to our increased allocated expenses to the slt segment from both information technology investments and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with company wide revenue growth 
additionally  we strategically invested in our research and development efforts to develop technologies and products for the junos platform 
in an effort to control costs  we have moved a significant portion of the slt development organization to lower cost regions while expanding our product portfolio 
slt management operating loss was also impacted by continued investments in our sales and distribution channels 
we allocate sales and marketing  general and administrative  as well as facility and information technology expenses to the slt segment generally based on revenue and headcount 
in the third quarter of  we increased our allocation of such expenses to the slt segment  compared to the same period in  primarily due to information technology investments and the higher variable compensation expenses associated with company wide revenue increases 
slt gross margin decreased slightly in  as compared to  due to higher manufacturing costs associated with newer and more complex products 
such higher manufacturing costs were partially offset as we realized the benefit of our cost reduction efforts of moving more manufacturing to lower cost regions 
the increases in slt operating expenses were partially offset by our revenue growth especially in the fourth quarter of due to customers demands for security products  particularly firewall  and due to typical quarterly seasonality 
we generally experienced quarterly seasonality and fluctuations in the demand for our slt products  particularly in the fourth quarter  which may result in greater variations in our quarterly operating results 
the slt segment incurred a management operating loss of million in  compared to the management operating income of million in  due primarily to higher product and personnel related costs  partially offset by higher slt net revenues and gross margin 
increases in personnel related costs were primarily related to headcount growth in order to support product innovation  new products sales and a larger customer base 
we made a strategic decision to invest more into the enterprise and slt markets to drive increased revenues and slt productivity in the future 
service operating segment an analysis of the change in revenue for the service segment can be found above in the section titled net revenue 
service management operating income increased million  or  from to million in by achieving economies of scale and cost control initiatives 
revenue growth surpassed cost of service expense growth in primarily due to our growth in installed base of equipment being serviced 
we also increased our service offerings and customer service infrastructure 
our service gross margin slightly decreased from to as we increased our headcount to build our global customer service and professional service organizations 
we expanded our customer service center in both north america and india as well as increased our resources for supporting network build outs and deployments by our customers 
service management operating income was also impacted by sales and marketing  general and administrative expenses as well as facilities and information systems management allocations to the service segment 
service gross margin percentages as well as service management operating income increased from to due primarily to improved economies of scale achieved by faster revenue growth through the infrastructure products and the slt products relative to the increases in operating costs 
in absolute dollars  employee related expenses increased in as a result of increased service related headcount from to individuals 
expenses associated with spare components also increased in to support increased demands driven by additional service contracts as a result of our growing installed base 
stock based compensation and related payroll taxes stock based compensation expense increased by million in as compared to the increase was primarily attributable to new stock options and rsu grants  partially offset by the lower stock option expense in as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options 
table of contents completed in december stock option vesting acceleration 
stock based compensation related payroll tax expense increased million in these expenses represent employment taxes we incurred in connection with our employee stock programs 
changes in such expenses are primarily attributable to the timing of the stock options exercises by our employees

working capital decreased million from december  to december  primarily due to the decrease in cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investments balance in the first and second quarters of our total cash  cash equivalents  and available for sale investments decreased by million during primarily due to stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program discussed below 
additionally  because the debt related to our outstanding zero coupon convertible notes is due within one year  we reclassified million of debt underlying such notes from long term to short term liabilities and  as a result  further reduced our working capital 
in  we generated million of cash from operations and million from our investing activities 
in addition  we received financing cash flows of million from common stock issued to our employees through stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
in  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for  million at an average purchase price of per share 
as of december   our stock repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of million 
we may repurchase additional shares opportunistically under this program  subject to a review of circumstances at the time 
see note in item for discussion of our stock repurchase activity in in june  we entered into a senior secured margin lending agreement with a third party financial institution for a maximum credit facility of million  or of the fair market value of the underlying collateral  to establish a flexible draw down facility to fund additional stock repurchases  as necessary 
this credit facility bore a floating interest rate equal to the three month usd libor plus basis points per annum and  if utilized  would be secured by our publicly traded fixed income securities portfolio equivalent to of any outstanding balance 
this credit facility was terminated on september  we did not utilize this credit facility at any time 
net accounts receivable increased million  or  to million from december  to december  primarily due to an increase in revenue and shipment linearity 
dso was days as of december  as compared to days as of december  the increase in dso was primarily a result of shipment linearity and the mix of customers we shipped to in the fourth quarter of shipment linearity represents the rate at which products are shipped during a period 
our distributor financing program had minimal impact on dso during approximately million of receivables sold under the distributor financing program had not been recognized in net revenues as of december  and therefore such amounts were recorded as debt financing in other accrued liabilities 
deferred revenue increased million or to million as of december  as compared to december  product and service deferred revenue increased million and million  respectively  in our product deferred revenue increased due to increases in the amount of product shipments not having met revenue recognition criteria and service deferred revenue increased due to an increase in the installed base of equipment under service contract 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources may also be impacted by acquisitions and investments in strategic relationships we may make in the networking equipment and information security markets 
if we were to repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program  our liquidity may be impacted 
additionally  a portion of our cash and investment balance is held overseas and may be subject to us taxes if repatriated 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  together with cash generated from operations as well as cash generated from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan will be sufficient to fund our operations  repayment of outstanding debt  and growth 
we believe our working capital is sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for capital expenditures  commitments  repurchases of our common stock  and other liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations through at least the next months 
however  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending on many factors  including the overall levels of sales of our products and gross profit margins  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans  the market acceptance of our products  repurchases of our common stock  issuance and repayment of debt  litigation expenses  settlements and judgments  volume price discounts and customer rebates  the levels of accounts receivable that we maintain  acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies  changes in our compensation policies  capital improvements for new and existing facilities  technological advances  our competitors responses to our products  our relationships with suppliers and customers  expenses related to our future restructuring plans  if any  tax expense associated with stock based awards  issuance of stock based awards and the related payment in cash for withholding taxes in the current year and possibly during future years  the level of exercises of stock options and stock purchases under our equity incentive plans  and general economic conditions and specific conditions in our industry and markets  including the effects of international conflicts and related uncertainties 
cash requirements and contractual obligations our principal commitments primarily consist of obligations outstanding under the zero coupon convertible senior notes due june  senior notes  operating leases  purchase commitments  tax liabilities and other contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations as of december  
table of contents and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions less than more than total year years years years other operating leases  net of committed subleases a senior notes b purchase commitments c tax liabilities d other contractual obligations e total a our contractual obligations under operating leases primarily relate to our leased facilities under our non cancelable operating leases 
rent payments are allocated to costs and operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we occupy approximately million square feet world wide under operating leases 
the majority of our office space is in north america  including our corporate headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
our longest lease expires in may b our principal commitment as of december  was our outstanding senior notes due june  the senior notes were issued in june and are senior unsecured obligations  rank on parity in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior unsecured debt  and rank senior to all of our existing and future debt that expressly provides that it is subordinated to the notes 
the senior notes bear no interest  but are convertible into shares of our common stock  subject to certain conditions  at any time prior to maturity or their prior repurchase by juniper networks 
the conversion rate is shares per each  principal amount of convertible notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the carrying value of the senior notes as of december  was million  which was included in current liabilities as the debt is due in less than one year 
c in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure adequate component supply  our contract manufacturers place non cancelable  non returnable ncnr orders for components based on our build forecasts 
as of december   there were ncnr component orders placed by our contract manufacturers with a value of million 
the contract manufacturers use the components to build products based on our forecasts and on purchase orders we have received from our customers 
generally  we do not own the components and title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon delivery at a designated shipment location 
if the components go unused or the products go unsold for specified periods of time  we may incur carrying charges or obsolete materials charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders 
as of december   we had accrued million based on our estimate of such charges 
d tax liabilities include the long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet for unrecognized tax positions 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
e other contractual obligations consist of the escrow amount of million and bonus accrual of million in connection with past acquisitions  a software subscription requiring payments of million in both january and january and a joint development agreement requiring quarterly payments of million through january

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
in addition  a portion of our cash and marketable securities are held in non us domiciled countries 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 

table of contents at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures 
the following tables present hypothetical changes in fair value of the financial instruments held at december  and that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in millions valuation of securities given an interest fair value as of valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps december  rate increase of x bps bps bps bps bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes other total valuation of securities given an interest fair value as of valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps december  rate increase of x bps bps bps bps bps bps bps government treasury and agencies corporate bonds and notes asset backed securities and other total these instruments are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts periodically  we use derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense in the same period as the changes in the fair value from the re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months 
our sales and costs of revenues are primarily denominated in us dollars 
our operating expenses are denominated in us dollars as well as other foreign currencies including the british pound  the euro  indian rupee  and japanese yen 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and  upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates 
we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial during the years ended december   and  respectively  in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
the increase in operating expenses including research and development  sales and marketing  as well as general and administrative expenses  due to foreign currency fluctuations  net of hedging  was approximately in 
table of contents equity price risk our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities is inherently exposed to equity price risk as the stock market fluctuates 
we monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of the equity investments exceeds its fair value  and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary  we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value 
we do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading or speculative purposes 
the aggregate fair value of our marketable equity securities was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in the stock prices of our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities would result in an immaterial loss 
in addition to publicly traded securities  we have also invested in privately held companies 
these investments are carried at cost 
the aggregate cost of our investments in privately held companies was million and million as of december  and  respectively
