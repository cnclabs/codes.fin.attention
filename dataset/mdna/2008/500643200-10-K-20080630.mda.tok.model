fee revenue increased in fiscal year to million with increases in all regions 
the north american region experienced the largest dollar increase in fee revenue 
in fiscal  we earned an operating profit of million with operating income from executive recruitment of million and million from futurestep  offset by corporate expenses of million 
this represents an increase of over operating income of million in fiscal we had no long term debt or outstanding balance under our credit facility at april  our working capital increased million during fiscal to million at april  critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below as critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
management is required to establish policies and procedures to ensure that revenue is recorded over the performance period for valid engagements and related costs are matched against such revenue 
we provide recruitment services on a retained basis and generally bill clients in three monthly installments 
since the fees are generally not contingent upon placement of a candidate  our assumptions primarily relate to establishing the period over which such service is performed 
these assumptions determine the timing of revenue recognition and profitability for the reported period 
if these assumptions do not accurately reflect the period over which revenue is earned  revenue and profit could differ 
any services that are provided on a contingent basis are recognized once the contingency is fulfilled 
deferred compensation 
estimating deferred compensation requires assumptions regarding the timing and probability of payments of benefits to participants and the discount rate 
changes in these assumptions would significantly impact the liability and related cost on our balance sheet and statement of operations 
management engages an independent actuary to periodically review these assumptions in order to ensure that they reflect the population and economics of our deferred compensation plans in all material respects and to assist us in estimating our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ from actual results due to changing market conditions or changes in the participant population 
these differences could have a significant impact on our deferred compensation liability and the related cost 
carrying values 
valuations are required under us generally accepted accounting principles to determine the carrying value of various assets 
our most significant assets for which management is required to prepare valuations are goodwill  intangible assets and deferred income taxes 
management must identify whether events have occurred that may impact the carrying value of these assets and make assumptions regarding future events  
table of contents such as cash flows and profitability 
differences between the assumptions used to prepare these valuations and actual results could materially impact the carrying amount of these assets and our operating results

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash on hand  borrowings available under our credit facility and funds from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 
however  adverse changes in our revenue could require us to cut costs or obtain financing to meet our cash needs 
we are not aware of any trends or demands or commitments that would materially affect liquidity or those that relate to our resources

cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were approximately million and million as of april  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
marketable securities consist of auction rate municipal securities  equity securities and fixed income mutual funds 
the primary objectives for these investments are liquidity 
as of april  we had million of auction rate securities 
frequent auctions have historically provided a liquid market for our auction rate securities 
however  in february  liquidity issues in the global credit markets caused auctions representing some of the auction rate securities we hold to fail because the amount of securities offered for sale exceeded the amount of bids 
as a result  the liquidity of our auction rate securities has diminished  and we expect that this decreased liquidity for our auction rate securities will continue as long as the present depressed global credit market environment persists  or until issuers refinance and replace these securities with other instruments 
despite the current auction market  we believe the credit quality of our auction rate securities remains high due to the credit worthiness of the issuers 
we have continued to collect the interest when due and at this time we expect to continue to do so going forward 
additionally  we expect we will receive the entire outstanding principal through either future successful auctions  sales of these securities outside the auction process  the issuers establishment of different form of financing to replace these securities  or the maturing of the securities 
we have classified auction rate securities as long term marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheet as of april  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details about our investments in auction rate securities and other marketable securities

the productivity based compensation increases are a direct result of substantial increases in revenues across business segments compared to the prior year 
offsetting these increases is a decrease in income taxes payable of million resulting from utilization of tax net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits related to foreign and alternative minimum taxes  and million of deferred compensation plan accruals associated to contributions by the company in various deferred compensations plans on behalf of employees compared to the prior year 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million used in the prior year 
for the year ended april   the increase in cash provided was primarily attributable to million of marketable securities sold in fiscal compared to purchases of million in fiscal capital expenditures during the year were million  an increase of million over prior year  primarily related to continuing expansion of our business and increased systems hardware and software costs

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas no 
clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas no 
also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  like sfas no

on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our global operating activities  we are exposed to certain market risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these risks in the normal course of our business as described below 
we have not utilized financial instruments for trading  hedging or other speculative purposes nor do we trade in derivative financial instruments 

table of contents foreign currency risk 
substantially all our foreign subsidiaries operations are measured in their local currencies 
assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the end of each reporting period and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the reporting period 
resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
transactions denominated in a currency other than the reporting entity s functional currency may give rise to transaction gains and losses that impact our results of operations 
historically  we have not realized significant foreign currency gains or losses on such transactions 
in the year ended april   we recognized foreign currency gains  after income taxes  of million primarily related to our emea and asia pacific operations 
our primary exposure to exchange losses is based on outstanding intercompany loan balances denominated in us dollars 
if the us dollar strengthened  and against the pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  the company s exchange loss would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  if the us dollar weakened by the same increments against pound sterling  the euro  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar and the yen  the company s exchange gain would have been million  million and million  respectively  based on outstanding balances at april  interest rate risk 
we primarily manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through our regular financing activities  which generally are short term and provide for variable market rates 
as of april   we had no outstanding balance on our credit facility 
we have million of borrowings against the cash surrender value of coli contracts as of april  bearing interest primarily at variable rates 
the risk of fluctuations in these variable rates is minimized by the fact that we receive a corresponding adjustment to our borrowed funds crediting rate on the cash surrender value on our coli contracts 
as of may   we held approximately million of marketable securities investments  classified as noncurrent assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities whose underlying assets are generally municipal notes or student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
in mid february liquidity issues in the global credit markets caused auctions for some of our auction rate securities to fail  and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
as a result of the current situation in the auction markets  our ability to liquidate our investment in auction rate securities and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or impossible 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities cannot 
if in the future the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investment without loss within the next year  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan
