the major product offerings of this segment are antioxidants our antioxidant business consists of a wide range of additives that inhibit the degradation of polymers caused by oxidation and light 
incorporating such additives into resin systems improves the durability and longevity of plastics used in food packaging  consumer durables  automotive components and electrical components 
we are proficient in blending a variety of these materials into specialized formulations uniquely tailored to customer specific end use requirements 
brominated performance products we are back integrated to a primary source of bromine and have a well developed business in supplying other types of brominated performance products to a variety of industries including agricultural  fine chemicals  pharmaceutical  electronics and oil well drilling 
bromine is also a key raw material for certain of our flame retardant products 
on december   the company entered into several long term supply and purchase agreements with tetra technologies  inc  primarily to sell bromine to tetra on an exclusive basis over a year period and to purchase sodium chloride over a period of years 
flame retardant polymer additives our flame retardant business holds a leading global position with a comprehensive offering of bromine  phosphorus and antimony based flame retardants 
with increasing regulatory and fire safety performance demands  the use of these products continues to grow in electrical components  construction materials  automotive and furniture furnishing applications 
fumigants part of our expertise in bromine based material is the production and distribution of methyl bromide  a fumigant used to improve crop yields  and protect grain in storage from pest infestation 
such materials are regularly used to treat food processing plants  breweries  warehouses and grain elevators  as well as rail cars  truck trailers and intermodal containers 
while the use of methyl bromide has been restricted by regulations  it continues to play an important role in protecting the food chain 
where safe and effective alternatives are not available  our products continue to be employed at cargo ports where agricultural commodities need to be treated quickly and comprehensively to prevent transmission of infestation across international borders and as a pre plant treatment to control weeds  diseases  insects and nematodes in high value food crops leading to increased yields and higher fresh produce quality 
polymerization additives initiators catalysts and inhibitors are chemicals used to initiate and terminate the polymerization reactions that transform monomers into polymers 
polymer modifiers are materials incorporated into resins to improve tensile strength and impact resistance or to modulate density and impart elasticity 
pvc additives our polyvinyl chloride pvc additives consist primarily of heat stabilizers that are essential to the processing of heat sensitive resins 
without the inclusion of such specialty additives  scorching of the resin during fabrication could result  compromising the functionality and appearance of the finished product 
high value end use applications with such demanding aesthetic standards include vinyl exterior siding  synthetic flooring and window profiles 
other large volume construction related uses include plumbing and drainage pipe  electrical conduit and wire and cable coatings 
as the trend to reduce the use of traditional heavy metal stabilizers lead and cadmium continues  chemtura is well positioned with a family of commercially proven  greener organic based heat stabilizers 
surfactants surfactants help to homogenize multi component resin systems and to facilitate lubricity in the processing and fabrication of such resins

the consumer products segment had net sales of million for  million for and million for this segment represents  and of the company s total net sales in  and  respectively 
crop protection our crop protection business focuses on specific target markets in five major product lines fungicides  miticides  insecticides  growth regulants and herbicides 
we have primarily developed our products for use on high value target markets  such as tree and vine fruits  ornamentals and nuts and secondarily for commodity row crops  such as soybeans  oilseed rape and corn 
our dedicated sales force works with growers and distributors to promote the use of our products throughout a crop s growth cycle and to address selective regional  climate  and growth opportunities 
we expand our presence in worldwide targeted markets by developing or acquiring crop protection products and obtaining registrations for new uses and geographies  where demand for our products and services has potential for growth 
we develop and sell our own products  and we also sell and register products manufactured by others on a license and or resale basis 
our seed treatments are used to coat seeds in order to protect the seed during germination and initial growth phases 
seed treatment is an environmentally attractive form of crop protection  involving localized use of agricultural chemicals at much lower use rates than other agrichemical treatments 
we anticipate growth in seed treatment resulting from the expanded use of higher value genetically modified seed 
on march   the company acquired the trace chemicals business from bayer cropscience lp 
trace chemicals is a leader in farmer applied seed treatments in markets serving the united states 
the acquisition serves to enhance the company s offerings in this fast growing crop market 
the crop protection business works closely with our customers  distributors  research stations and individual growers  as part of an on the ground coordinated effort 
we develop products in response to ongoing customer demands  drawing upon existing technologies and tailoring them to match immediate needs 
for example  a grower s crops may require varying levels of treatment depending on weather conditions and the degree of infestation 
our research and technology is therefore geared towards responding to threats to crops around the world as they emerge under a variety of conditions 
our crop protection business benefits from nearly years of experience in the field  along with product registrations in more than countries 
our experience with registering products is a valuable asset  as registration is a significant barrier to entry  particularly in developed countries 
registration of products is a complex process in which we have developed proficiency over time 
the breadth of our distribution network and the depth of our experience enable us to focus on profitable markets that have been less sensitive to competitive pricing pressures than broad commodity segments of the market 
this position allows us to attract licensing and resale opportunities from partner companies providing us new products and technologies to accompany our own existing chemistries 
the crop protection business sells its products in north america through a distribution network consisting of more than distributor outlets that sell directly to end use customers 
internationally  the crop protection business s direct sales force services over  distributors  dealers  cooperatives  seed companies and large growers 
the crop protection reporting segment had net sales for of million  million for and million for  which represents  and of the company s total net sales in  and  respectively 
other the other segment consists of the company s non core businesses that are in the process of being sold or are undergoing strategic assessment 
this category presently includes industrial water additives and rubber chemicals 
the polymer processing equipment business was also included until it was sold in april the rubber chemicals business sold the celogen foaming agents product line in the second quarter of  and its antioxidants  secondary accelerators  bonding agents  waxes  and some antiozonants were realigned under our polymer additives segment 
rubber chemicals represented in this segment are ppd antiozonants and their derivatives  and primary accelerators 
industrial water additives iwa are used in the desalination processes and include antiscalents  corrosion inhibitors  dispersants  antifoams and superior bromine based non oxidizing and oxidizing microbiological control products 
the iwa business was divested in the second quarter of  however the company continues to manufacture and sell these products to the purchaser of this business under supply agreements 
rubber chemicals are antiozonants which protect rubber compounds from cracking and deteriorating from exposure to ozone as well as providing resistance to oxygen and heat 
the primary accelerators are used to accelerate the rubber curing during fabrication 
the other reporting segment had net sales of million in  million in and million in  which represents  and of the company s total net sales in  and  respectively 
sources of raw materials hydrocarbon based and inorganic chemicals constitute most of the raw materials required to manufacture our products 
these materials are generally available from a number of sources  some of which are foreign 
we use significant amounts of ethylene  propylene  benzene  chlorine  caustic  petrochemicals  tin  soybean oil  and tallow in many of our chemical manufacturing processes 
large increases in the cost of such key raw materials  as well as natural gas which powers some key production facilities  could adversely affect our operating margins if we are not able to pass the higher costs on to our customers through higher selling prices 
while temporary shortages of raw materials we use may occur occasionally  key raw materials are generally available 
however  their continuing availability and price are subject to domestic and world market and political conditions and regulations 
major requirements for key raw materials are typically purchased pursuant to multi year contracts 
seasonal business with the exception of the crop protection business and the pool and spa product line in our consumer products segment  no material portion of any segment of our business is significantly seasonal 
our crop business is seasonal in nature and corresponds to agricultural cycles 
similarly  the largest portion  approximately  of our pool chemicals business serves the us recreational water market and generally records higher sales in the later part of the second quarter and the early part of the third quarter of each year 
customers no one customer s business accounts for more than ten percent of our consolidated net sales 
employees the company has approximately  full time employees of its wholly owned operations at december  competitive conditions the breadth of our product offering provides multiple channels for growth and lessens our dependence on any one market 
we sell our products in more than countries  and this worldwide presence further reduces our exposure to any one country s or region s economy 
we have a broad client base and believe that our products  many of which we customize for the specific needs of our customers  allow us to enhance customer loyalty and attract customers that value product innovation and reliable supply 
product performance  quality  price  and technical and customer service are all important factors in competing in substantially all of our businesses 
we face significant competition in many of the markets in which we operate as a result of the trends toward global expansion and consolidation by competitors 
some of our existing competitors are larger than we are and may have more resources and better access to capital markets for continued expansion or new product development than we do 
some of our competitors also have a greater product range or better distribution capability than we do for specific products or geographical areas 
research and development our research and development expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in research and development works with each business within the company to help bring safe and effective new products to market in a timely manner while also maintaining existing product registrations required by regulatory agencies around the world 
intellectual property and licenses we have approximately  united states and foreign patents and pending applications and have trademark protection for approximately product names 
patents  trade names  trademarks  know how  trade secrets  formulae  and manufacturing techniques assist in maintaining the competitive position of certain of our products 
patents  formulae  and know how are of particular importance in the manufacture of a number of specialty chemicals manufactured and sold by us 
we are licensed to use certain patents and technologies owned by other companies  including some foreign companies  to manufacture products complementary to our own products  for which we pay royalties in amounts not considered material to our consolidated financial results 
products to which we have such rights include certain crop protection chemicals 
environmental matters chemical companies are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to land  surface  subsurface strata and water and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste and other materials 
chemical companies are also subject to other federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters 
environmental health and safety regulation we believe that our business  operations and facilities have been and are being operated in substantial compliance  in all material respects  with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
the ongoing operations of chemical manufacturing plants  however  entail risks in these areas and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred 
in addition  future developments  such as increasingly strict requirements of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and enforcement policies there under  could bring into question the handling  manufacture  use  emission or disposal of substances or pollutants at facilities owned  used or controlled by us or our manufacture  use or disposal of certain products or wastes and could involve potentially significant expenditures 
to meet changing permitting and regulatory standards  we may be required to make significant site or operational modifications  potentially involving substantial expenditures and reduction or suspension of certain operations 
we incurred million of costs for capital projects and million for operating and maintenance costs related to environmental health and safety programs at our facilities during in  we expect to incur approximately million of costs for capital projects and million for operating and maintenance costs related to environmental health and safety programs at our facilities 
during  we paid million to clean up previously utilized waste disposal sites and to remediate current and past facilities 
we expect to spend approximately million during to clean up such waste disposal sites and to remediate current and former facilities 
pesticide regulation our crop protection business is subject to regulation under various federal  state  and foreign laws and regulations relating to the manufacture  sale and use of pesticide products 
in august  congress enacted the food quality protection act of fqpa  which made significant changes to the federal insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act fifra  governing us sale and use of pesticide products and the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca  which limits pesticide residues on food 
fqpa facilitated registrations and re registrations of pesticides for special so called minor uses under fifra and authorized collection of maintenance fees to support pesticide re registrations 
coordination of regulations implementing fifra and ffdca is now required 
food safety provisions of fqpa establish a single standard of safety for pesticide residue on raw and processed foods  require that information be provided through large food retail stores to consumers about the health risks of pesticide residues and how to avoid them  preempt state and local food safety laws if they are based on concentrations of pesticide residues below recently established federal residue limits called tolerances  and ensure that tolerances protect the health of infants and children 
ffdca  as amended by fqpa  authorizes the environmental protection agency epa to set a tolerance for a pesticide in or on food at a level which poses a reasonable certainty of no harm to consumers 
the epa is required to review all tolerances for all pesticide products 
most of our products have successfully completed review  others are currently under review and other products will be reviewed under this standard in the future 
the european union eu commission has established procedures whereby all existing crop protection active ingredient chemicals commercially available in the eu are to be reviewed 
the regulation came into force in and the process was updated in and the original list of existing chemicals was prioritized and divided into parts  chemtura had four chemicals on the first list  three of which were successfully supported through the review  which results in inclusion onto annex i of  while the fourth was withdrawn by the company for commercial reasons 
the remainder of our products will be reviewed in future years with the overall process expected to be completed by the end of the process may lead to full registration in member states of the eu or may lead to some restrictions or cancellation of registrations if it is determined that a product poses an unacceptable risk 
chemical regulation reach in december  the european union signed the registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach legislation 
this legislation will require chemical manufacturers and importers in the european union to prove the safety of their products 
the effective date of the legislation was june  and it requires all covered substances to be pre registered by november  products containing covered substances cannot be manufactured or imported into the eu after this date unless they are pre registered 
the full registration requirements of reach will be phased in over the next ten years 
the company does not anticipate any significant impact to its financial position or results of operations in  however  the impact of this legislation in and beyond is unknown at this time and the company will need to incur additional expense to affect the registration of its products under these regulations 
it is possible that reach may affect our ability to manufacture and sell certain products 
d geographic information the information with respect to sales and property  plant and equipment attributable to each of our major geographic areas served for each of our last three fiscal years is set forth in the note business segment data in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider that the risks relating to operations of our foreign subsidiaries are comparable to those of other us companies which operate subsidiaries in developed countries 
these risks include risks of political change  change in tax regulations  change in business climate  economic changes and foreign currency volatility

item a 
risk factors the factors described below represent the principal risks that could materially adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
except as otherwise indicated  these factors may or may not occur and we cannot predict the likelihood of any such factor occurring 
other risk factors may exist that we do not consider significant based on information that is currently available 
in addition  new risks may emerge at any time  and we cannot predict those risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect our financial performance 
a decline in general economic conditions and other external factors may adversely impact our results of operations 
external factors  including general economic conditions  international events and circumstances  competitor actions and governmental regulation are beyond our control and can cause fluctuations in demand and volatility in the price of raw materials and other costs that can intensify the impact of economic cycles on our operations 
we produce a broad range of products that are used as additives and components in other products in a wide variety of end use markets 
as a result  our products may be negatively impacted by supply and demand instability in other industries and the effects of that instability on supply chain participants 
economic and political conditions in countries in which we operate may also adversely impact our operations 
these same risks may also impact the financial markets and may negatively affect our access to capital 
while these external factors may adversely affect our businesses  we believe that the breadth of our product offering lessens our dependence on any one market and that our worldwide presence further reduces our exposure to economic conditions or political instability in any one country or region 
significant competition may force us to reduce prices  which may adversely impact our results of operations 
we face significant competition in many of the markets in which we operate as a result of the trend toward global expansion and consolidation by competitors 
some of our existing competitors are larger than we are and may have more resources and better access to capital markets to facilitate continued expansion or new product development 
some of our competitors also have greater product range or better distribution capability than we do for specific products or geographic regions 
price competition also exists in some of the markets in which we participate where customers are sensitive to changes in price 
additionally  other factors such as industry overcapacity and lower cost structures have the effect of putting downward pressure on prices 
we expect that we will continue to face new competitive challenges as well as additional risks inherent in international operations in developing regions 
we also expect to face increased competition from the further use and introduction of generic and alternative products by our competitors 
this increased competition could cause us to reduce our prices and take other steps to compete effectively  which could negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  even if we were to raise prices  the reactions of our competitors and customers to such price increases could cause us to reevaluate and possibly reverse such price increases or risk a loss in sales volumes 
the cyclicality of the chemicals industry may cause significant fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows 
our historical operating results reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply and demand balance of the chemicals industry 
the chemicals industry has experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity and tight supply  allowing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods when substantial capacity is added  resulting in oversupply  over capacity and corresponding declining utilization rates  causing declining prices and profit margins 
the cyclicality of the markets in which we operate may result in volatile operating results and cash flow over our business cycle 
future growth in product demand may not be sufficient to utilize current or future capacity 
excess industry capacity may continue to depress our volumes and margins on some products 
as a result of excess industry capacity  rising energy costs and rising raw materials costs  operating results may be volatile 
any disruption in the availability or price of the raw materials or energy utilized for our products may have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we purchase large amounts of raw materials and energy for our businesses 
the costs of these materials and energy  in the aggregate  represent a substantial portion of our operating expenses 
the prices and availability of the raw materials we use vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
over the past few years  we have experienced significant cost increases in purchases of petrochemicals  tin  soybean oil  other raw materials and our primary energy source  natural gas 
while we may attempt to match raw material or energy price increases with corresponding product price increases  we may not be able to immediately raise product prices  if at all 
ultimately  our ability to pass on increases in the cost of raw materials or energy to customers is greatly dependent upon market conditions and raising prices could result in a loss of sales volume 
there have been in the past  and will likely be in the future  periods of time during which we are unable to pass raw material and energy price increases on to our customers  in whole or in part 
reactions by our customers and competitors to our price increases could cause us to reevaluate and possibly reverse such price increases  which may increase our operating expenses and negatively affect our operating results 
the results of our crop protection business are dependent on weather  disease  and pest conditions and can be affected by local and regional economic circumstances 
the results of our consumer products business are also dependent on weather conditions 
adverse weather or economic conditions could materially affect our results of operations 
sales volumes for our crop protection business  as with all agricultural products  are subject to the sector s dependency on weather  disease  and pest infestation conditions 
adverse conditions in a particular region could materially adversely affect our crop protection business 
demand for crop protection products is also influenced by the agricultural policies of governments and regulatory authorities particularly in developing countries in regions where we do business  such as in asia and latin america 
changes in governmental policies or product registration requirements could have an adverse impact on our ability to market and sell our products 
also  crop protection products typically are sold pursuant to contracts with extended payment terms in latin america and europe 
customary extended payment periods  which are tied to particular crop growing cycles  make our crop protection business susceptible to losses from receivables during economic downturns and may adversely affect our operating results and our cash flows 
our pool and spa products in the consumer products business are primarily used in swimming pools and hot tubs 
demand for these products is influenced by a variety of factors including seasonal weather patterns 
an adverse change in weather patterns during pool season could adversely affect the demand for and profitability of our pool and spa products 
current and future litigation  governmental investigations and administrative claims  including antitrust related governmental investigations and lawsuits  could harm our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are currently involved in a number of governmental investigations and administrative claims  including antitrust related governmental investigations and civil lawsuits 
further  we have incurred and could incur additional expense in the future in connection with antitrust related matters  including expenses related to our cooperation with governmental authorities and defense related civil lawsuits 
we are also involved in several significant lawsuits and claims relating to environmental matters 
in addition  we are routinely subject to other civil claims  litigation and arbitration  and regulatory investigations  arising in the ordinary course of our present businesses as well as with respect to our divested businesses 
some of these claims and lawsuits relate to product liability claims  including claims related to current products and asbestos related claims concerning the premises and historic products of our corporate affiliates and predecessors 
we also could become subject to additional claims in the future 
an adverse outcome of one or more of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or cash flows 
environmental  health and safety regulation matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to extensive federal  state  local and foreign environmental  safety and health laws  and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions in the air  discharges to land and water  and the generation  handling  treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials 
our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws and sanctions for violations  such as clean up costs  costs of waste disposal  and payments for property damage and personal injury 
although it is our policy to comply with such laws and regulations  it is possible that we have not been or may not be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements 
in addition  these requirements  and enforcement of these requirements  may become more stringent in the future 
the ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements could be material 
non compliance could subject us to material liabilities  such as government fines or orders  third party lawsuits  remediations  and settlements  or the suspension of non compliant operations 
we may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost 
future regulatory or other developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products  packaging  manufacturing processes and technology  which could have a significant adverse impact on our cash flow and results of operations 
at any given time  we are involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings  settlements  and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage  personal injury  and regulatory compliance or noncompliance 
the resolution of these environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flow 
we are an international company and are exposed to risks in the countries in which we have significant operations or interests 
changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements  export controls or international tax treaties could adversely affect our results of operations 
we are dependent  in large part  on the economies of the countries in which we manufacture and market our products 
of our net sales  were to customers in the us and canada  to europe and africa  to asia pacific and to latin america 
our net property  plant and equipment at december  was located in the us and canada  in europe and africa  in asia pacific and in latin america 
the economies of countries in these areas are in different stages of socioeconomic development 
consequently  we are exposed to risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  inflation  governmental spending  social instability and other political  economic or social developments that may materially affect  positively or negatively  our results of operations or cash flows 
we may also face difficulties managing and administering an internationally dispersed business 
in particular  the management of our personnel across several countries can present logistical and managerial challenges 
additionally  international operations present challenges related to operating under different business cultures and languages  we may have to comply with unexpected changes in foreign laws and regulatory requirements which could negatively impact our operations and ability to manage our global financial resources  export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent us from shipping our products into and from some markets  we may not be able to adequately protect our trademarks and other intellectual property overseas due to uncertainty of laws and enforcement in a number of countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights  and changes in tax regulation and international tax treaties could significantly reduce the financial performance of our foreign operations or the magnitude of their contributions to our overall financial performance 
the inability to register our products in member states of the european union  under the reach legislation  may lead to some restrictions or cancellation of registrations  which could impact our ability to manufacture and sell certain products 
in december  the european union signed the registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach legislation 
this legislation will require chemical manufacturers and importers in the european union to prove the safety of their products 
the effective date of the legislation was june  and it requires all covered substances to be pre registered by november  products containing covered substances cannot be manufactured or imported into the eu after this date unless they are pre registered 
the full registration requirements of reach will be phased in over the next ten years 
the company does not anticipate any significant impact to its financial position or results of operations in  however  the impact of this legislation in and beyond is unknown at this time and the company will need to incur additional expense to affect the registration of its products under these regulations 
it is possible that reach may affect our ability to sell and manufacture certain products 
our results of operations are subject to exchange rate and other currency risks 
a significant movement in exchange rates could adversely impact our results of operations 
significant portions of our businesses are conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
this means that foreign currency exchange rates affect our operating results 
the following table shows the impact of foreign currency exchange rates on our pre tax loss from continuing operations and net sales for  and year ended december in millions pre tax loss from continuing operations impact of favorable unfavorable foreign currency translation on pre tax earnings loss from continuing operations net sales impact of favorable foreign currency translation on net sales effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results cannot be predicted because of the number of currencies involved  the variability of currency exposures  and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
we will face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations 
exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls 
currency devaluations result in diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting a devaluation 
actions of this nature could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow 
we have unfunded and underfunded pension plans and post retirement health care plans  which  if changes to the funded status occur  could adversely impact our results of operations or cash flows 
we have unfunded obligations under our domestic tax qualified defined benefit pension plans  totaling approximately million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of december  a significant decline in the value of the plan investments in the future or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
we also sponsor foreign and non qualified pension plans under which there are substantial unfunded liabilities  totaling approximately million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of december  in addition  we sponsor post retirement health care plans under which there are substantial unfunded liabilities  totaling approximately million on a projected benefit obligation basis as of december  mandatory funding contributions with respect to our tax qualified pension plans and potential unfunded benefit liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
changes in our sales strategy may impact our results of operations and our ability to service our customers 
we use third party distributors for sales and service to some customers that purchase small annual quantities of our products 
we believe that this action will lower our costs associated with serving smaller customers  thus enhancing profitability and reducing our investment in inventory 
however  it is possible that changing our sales strategy with respect to these customers could result in the loss of volume to some customers or some disruption in selling and in inventory management during the transition 
we are dependent upon a trained  dedicated sales force  the loss of which could materially affect our operations 
many of our products are sold and supported through dedicated staff and specifically trained personnel 
the loss of this sales force due to market or other conditions could affect our ability to sell and support our products effectively  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
production facilities are subject to operating risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on the continued operation of our production facilities 
such production facilities are subject to hazards associated with the manufacturing  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including pipeline leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  remediation complications  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous gases  storage tank leaks  and other environmental risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental damage  fines  and liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
our business depends upon many proprietary technologies  including patents and licenses 
our competitive position could be adversely affected if we fail to protect our patents or other intellectual property rights  or if we become subject to claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others 
we have over  united states and foreign patents and pending applications and have trademark protection for approximately product names 
patents  trademarks  trade secrets in the nature of know how  formulations  and manufacturing techniques assist us in maintaining the competitive position of certain of our products 
our intellectual property is of particular importance to a number of specialty chemicals we manufacture and sell 
we are licensed to use certain patents and technology owned by other companies  including some foreign companies  to manufacture products complementary to our own products  for which we pay royalties in amounts not considered material  in the aggregate  to our consolidated results 
our trademarks or the patents we own or license may be challenged  and as a result of such challenges we could lose our exclusive rights to our proprietary technologies  which would adversely affect our competitive position and our results of operations 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while it is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to restrict the use and disclosure of our trade secrets and proprietary know how  those confidentiality agreements may be breached 
in addition  adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of such trade secrets and know how  and others could obtain knowledge of such trade secrets through independent development or other access by legal means 
the failure of our patents  trademarks or confidentiality agreements to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets  or proprietary know how could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
our patents may not provide full protection against competing manufacturers outside of the united states  the european union countries  and certain other developed countries 
weaker protection may adversely impact our sales and results of operations 
in some of the countries in which we operate  such as china  the laws protecting patent holders are significantly weaker than in the united states  the european union  and certain other developed countries 
weaker protection may help competing manufacturers be or become more competitive in markets where  but for the weaker protection  they might not otherwise be able to introduce competing products for a number of years 
we therefore tend  in these regions  to rely more heavily upon trade secret and know how protection  as applicable  than we do patents 
in addition  for our crop protection products being sold in china  we rely on regulatory protection of intellectual property provided by regulatory agencies that may not provide us with complete protection against competitors 
an inability to remain technologically innovative and to offer improved products and services in a cost effective manner could adversely impact our operating results 
our operating results are influenced in part by our ability to introduce new products and services that offer distinct value to our customers 
for example  our crop protection business seeks to provide tailored products for our customers often unique problems  which requires an ongoing level of innovation 
in many of the markets where we sell our products  the products are subject to a traditional product life cycle 
we devote significant human and financial resources to develop new technologically advanced products and services and we may not be successful in our research and development efforts 
convergence of our information systems could have an adverse effect on our internal controls over financial reporting or our results of operations 
we are consolidating our multiple erp systems on a single sap platform in order to standardize our business process and data  together with creating efficiencies in processing information 
the transition from these systems or the inability to transition to one standard system could adversely affect our business and operations and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results 
any discord with our venture partners could potentially adversely affect the business and operations of the ventures and in turn the business and operations of the company 
a portion of our operations is conducted through certain ventures 
we share control of these ventures with third parties and in the event that our venture partners do not observe their venture obligations  it is possible that the affected venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans or that we would have to increase our level of commitment to the venture to give effect to those plans 
by making these arrangements with third parties we run the risk of encountering differences of opinion or having difficulty reaching consensus with respect to certain business issues 
an inability to execute our portfolio transformation plan could adversely affect our financial condition 
the assessment of the current businesses in our portfolio continues to be a multi year task and we are in discussions regarding potential transactions 
announcements will be made as agreements become firm 
there can be no assurance that any of these transactions can be successfully completed or that we will realize the proceeds or cost savings we anticipate receiving

item legal proceedings the corporation is involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions 
a number of such matters involve  or may involve  claims for a material amount of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage and personal injury 
environmental liabilities each quarter  the company evaluates and reviews estimates for future remediation and other costs to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site where the cost of remediation is probable and estimable  a determination is made of the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by the company and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
at sites where the company expects to incur ongoing operations and maintenance expenditures  the company accrues on an undiscounted basis for a period  which is generally years  where it believes that such costs are estimable 
the total amount accrued for such environmental liabilities at december   was million 
the company estimates the environmental liability could range up to million at december  the company s reserves include estimates for determinable clean up costs 
the company recorded a pre tax charge of million in  million in and million in to increase its environmental liabilities and made payments of million in and million in for clean up costs  which reduced its environmental liabilities 
at certain sites  the company has contractual agreements with certain other parties to share remediation costs 
the company has a receivable of million at december  to reflect probable recoveries 
at a number of these sites  the extent of contamination has not yet been fully investigated or the final scope of remediation is not yet determinable 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
however  the final cost of clean up at these sites could exceed the company s present estimates and could have  individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
it is reasonably possible that the company s estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken  current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted 
the company and some of its subsidiaries have been identified by federal  state or local governmental agencies  and by other potentially responsible parties a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state statutes  as a prp with respect to costs associated with waste disposal sites at various locations in the united states 
because in certain circumstances these laws have been construed to authorize joint and several liability  the epa could seek to recover all costs involving a waste disposal site from any one of the prp s for such site  including the company  despite the involvement of other prp s 
in many cases  the company is one of several hundred prp s so identified 
in a few instances  the company is the sole or one of only a handful of parties performing investigation and remediation 
where other financially responsible prp s are involved  the company expects that any ultimate liability resulting from such matters will be apportioned between the company and such other parties 
in addition  the company is involved with environmental remediation and compliance activities at some of its current and former sites in the united states and abroad 
the more significant of these matters are described below

the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will continue to assess relevant facts and attempt to negotiate an acceptable settlement with the epa 
the company does not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition

multiple lawsuits have been filed against the company by individuals who were a part of the putative class 
the matter has proceeded to the discovery phase 
the company believes that it has meritorious defenses and will be filing dispositive motions

osca great lakes previously held interests in osca  inc  which interests were divested to bj services company in may osca is a party to certain pending litigation regarding a blowout of a well in the gulf of mexico operated by newfield exploration company 
in the lawsuit  the plaintiffs claimed that osca and the other defendants breached their contracts to perform work over operations on the well and were negligent in performing those operations 
pursuant to an indemnification agreement between great lakes and bj services entered into at the time of the sale of osca  great lakes agreed to remain responsible for of any uninsured liability and costs in excess of million incurred by osca upon settlement or final determination of this pending litigation 
in april  a jury found osca and the other defendants responsible for those claims and determined osca s share of the damages 
in connection with the lawsuit  osca asserted claims against its insurers and insurance brokers in support of insurance coverage for this incident 
following a related trial on these insurance coverage claims  the court issued its final judgments on the underlying liability claims and the insurance coverage claims  entering judgment against osca for a net amount of approximately million plus interest and finding that such amount was not covered by insurance 
the company and bj services appealed certain of the liability and insurance coverage decisions 
in april  the united states fifth circuit court of appeals affirmed the jury s verdict on liability against osca  but reversed in part the district court s decision regarding insurance coverage available to osca and remanded the matter to the district court 
after the case was remanded  osca s insurer agreed to provide coverage for about half of the outstanding judgment against osca  leaving approximately million at issue for the district court to address on remand 
thereafter  the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment with the district court on the remaining coverage issues 
on september   the district court granted summary judgment in osca s favor on two out of the three remaining categories of costs in dispute 
this ruling requires aislic  osca s insurer  to cover an additional million plus interest of osca liability to newfield  leaving approximately million still at issue 
on or about february   aislic agreed to cover virtually all of the million remaining at issue 
the only remaining matter is aislic s obligation to pay osca s attorney s fees and costs associated with the underlying liability action approximately million 
this matter will be mediated in the second quarter of each quarter the company evaluates and reviews pending claims and litigation to determine appropriate reserve amounts 
as of december   the company s accrual for probable loss in the aforementioned legal proceeding cases is immaterial 
in addition  the related receivable to reflect probable insurance recoveries is also immaterial 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
the resolution of the legal proceedings now pending or hereafter asserted against the company or any of its subsidiaries could require the company to pay costs or damages in excess of its present estimates  and as a result could  either individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition to the matters referred to above  the company is subject to routine litigation in connection with the ordinary course of its business 
these routine matters have not had a material adverse effect on the company  its business or financial condition in the past  and the company does not expect this litigation  individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on its business or its financial condition in the future  but it can give no assurance that such will be the case

critical accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
accounting estimates and assumptions in this section are those the company considers to be the most critical to understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize the company s critical accounting estimates 
significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
under such circumstances  the company assesses whether the projected undiscounted cash flows of its businesses are sufficient to recover the existing unamortized cost of its long lived assets 
if the undiscounted projected cash flows are not sufficient  the company calculates the impairment amount by discounting the projected cash flows using its weighted average cost of capital 
the amount of the impairment is written off against earnings in the period in which the impairment has been determined in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company tests the recoverability of goodwill for each of its reporting units on an annual basis as of july  or sooner if events occur or circumstances change  by comparing the net book value to the estimated fair value of each of its reporting units to determine if there is a potential impairment issue 
the fair value is estimated based on discounted projected cash flows 
in estimating the discounted projected cash flows  the company utilizes estimated long term revenue and cash flow forecasts developed as part of its planning process  as well as assumptions of terminal value  together with its weighted average cost of capital  to determine fair value 
if the fair value is not sufficient to cover the carrying value of the reporting unit  the company calculates the goodwill impairment amount related to that reporting unit in accordance with fasb statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
any impairment is charged against earnings in the period in which the amount has been determined 
the company s cash flow projections  used to estimate the fair value of its reporting units  are based on subjective estimates 
although the company believes that its projections reflect its best estimates of the future performance of its reporting units  changes in estimated revenues or operating margins could have an impact on the estimated fair values 
any increases in estimated reporting unit cash flows would have had no impact on the carrying value of that reporting unit 
however  a decrease in future estimated reporting unit cash flows could require the company to determine whether recognition of a goodwill impairment charge was required 
based on the estimated fair values used to test goodwill for impairment in accordance with fasb statement no 
 the company concluded that no impairment existed in any of its reporting units at july  if the operating margin used in estimating the fair value of the consumer products reporting unit were assumed to be basis points lower  the carrying value of the reporting unit would exceed the estimated fair value by approximately million and the company would then determine whether recognition of a goodwill impairment charge would be required 
as of july   the company has not factored in any improvements to future cash flow projections that might be made to the reporting unit as a result of acquisitions or expansion of product lines into target regions 
if the company had been required to recognize a goodwill impairment charge  there would not have been a direct impact on the company s liquidity and capital resources because impairment charges are non cash losses that do not impact the leverage or interest coverage ratios under the company s domestic credit facility 
the company continually monitors and evaluates business and competitive conditions that affect its operations and reflects the impact of these factors in its financial projections 
if permanent or sustained changes in business and competitive conditions occur  they can lead to revised projections that could potentially give rise to impairment charges 
environmental matters the company is involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions 
a number of such matters involve claims for a material amount of damages and relate to or allege environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with hazardous waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage and personal injury 
the company and some of its subsidiaries have been identified by federal  state or local governmental agencies  and by other potentially responsible parties each a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or comparable state statutes  as a prp with respect to costs associated with waste disposal sites at various locations in the united states 
in addition  the company is involved with environmental remediation and compliance activities at some of its current and former sites in the united states and abroad 
each quarter  the company evaluates and reviews estimates for future remediation  and operation and management costs directly related to remediation  to determine appropriate environmental reserve amounts 
for each site where the cost of remediation is probable and estimable  a determination is made of the specific measures that are believed to be required to remediate the site  the estimated total cost to carry out the remediation plan  the portion of the total remediation costs to be borne by the company and the anticipated time frame over which payments toward the remediation plan will occur 
at sites where the company expects to incur ongoing operation and maintenance expenditures  the company accrues on an undiscounted basis for a period  which is generally years  where it believes that such costs are estimable 
as of december   the company s reserves for environmental remediation activities totaled million 
the company estimates the environmental liability could range up to million at december  the company s reserves include estimates for determinable clean up costs 
at a number of these sites  the extent of contamination has not yet been fully investigated or the final scope of remediation is not yet determinable 
in addition  it is possible that the company s estimates for environmental remediation liabilities may change in the future should additional sites be identified  further remediation measures be required or undertaken  current laws and regulations be modified or additional environmental laws and regulations be enacted 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue other equitable factors that are available with respect to these matters 
the resolution of the environmental matters now pending or hereafter asserted against the company or any of its subsidiaries could require the company to pay remedial costs or damages  which are not currently determinable  could exceed the company s present estimates  and as a result could have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
pension and other post retirement benefits expense the company s calculation of pension and other post retirement benefits expense is dependent on a number of assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  mortality rates  expected salary and wage increases  and other factors 
components of pension and other post retirement benefits expense include interest and service cost on the pension and other post retirement benefit plans  expected return on plan assets and amortization of certain unrecognized costs and obligations 
actual results that differ from the assum ptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while the company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect its pension and other post retirement benefits costs and obligations 
pension plans pension liabilities are measured on a discounted basis and the assumed discount rate is a significant assumption 
at each measurement date  the discount rate is based on interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to our liabilities 
at november   the company utilized a weighted average discount rate of for domestic pension plans  compared to used at november  for the international and non qualified plans  a weighted average dis count rate of was used at november   compared to used at november  as a sensitivity measure  a basis point reduction in the discount rate for all plans would result in approximately a million decrease in pre tax earnings for the domestic discount rate adopted at november  utilizes an interest rate yield curve to determine the discount rate pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d  selection of discount rates used for measuring defined benefit pension obligations and obligations of post retirement benefit plans other than pensions 
the yield curve is comprised of aaa aa bonds with maturities between zero and thirty years 
the company discounts the annual cash flows of its domes tic pension plans using this yield curve and develops a single point discount rate matching the plan s payout structure 
a similar approach is used to determine the appropriate discount rates for the international plans 
the actual method used varies from country to country depending on the amount of available information on bond yields to be able to estimate a single point discount rate to match the plans benefit disbursements 
the company s weighted average estimated rate of compensation increase was for all domestic and international pension plans combined at november  as a sensitivity measure  an increase of basis points in the estimated rate of compensation increase would decrease pre tax earnings for by an immaterial amount 
the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our investment strategy  historical experience  and expectations for long term rates of return 
the company determines the expected rate of return on plan assets for the domestic and international pension plans by applying the expected returns on various asset classes to the company s target asset allocation 
the company utilized a weighted average expected long term rate of return of on all domestic plan assets and a weighted average rate of for the international plan assets at november  historical returns are evaluated based on an arithmetic average of annual returns derived from recognized passive indices  such as the s p  for the major asset classes 
the company looked at the arithmetic averages of annual investment returns from passive indices  assuming a portfolio of investments that follow the current target asset allocation for the domestic plans over several business cycles  to obtain an indication of the long term historical market performance 
the arithmetic average return over the past years was  and over the past years it was 
these values are not significantly higher than the geometric averages for the same periods and exceed the domestic expected return on assets 
the actual annualized return on plan assets for the domestic plans for the months ending november  was approximately  which was less than the expected return on asset assumption for the year  resulting in a loss for the plans 
similarly  the international plans earned a weighted average return of approximately in local currency terms  before allowing for depreciation of the us dollar against major currencies in and in us dollar terms 
the company s target asset allocation for the domestic pension plans is based on investing of plan assets in equity instruments  of plan assets in fixed income investments and in real estate 
at november   of the portfolio was invested in equities  in fixed income investments and the remainder in real estate and other 
there were no significant changes to the asset allocation during the company has unrecognized actuarial losses relating to its pension plans which have been included in its consolidated balance sheet but not in the consolidated statements of operations 
the extent to which these unrecognized actuarial losses will impact future pre tax earnings depends on whether the unrecognized actuarial losses are deferred through the asset smoothing mechanism the market related value as defined by fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions  or though amortization in pre tax earnings to the extent that they exceed a amortization corridor  as defined by fasb statement no 
 which provides for amortization over the average remaining participant career 
the amortization of unrecognized net losses existing as of november  will result in a million decrease to pre tax earnings for million for the qualified domestic plans and million for the international and non qualified plans 
since future gains and losses beyond are a result of various factors described herein  it is not possible to predict with certainty to what extent the combination of current and future losses may exceed the percent amortization corridor and thereby be subject to further amortization 
pension income expense is calculated based upon certain assumptions including discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and expected salary and wage increases 
actual results that differ from the current assumptions utilized are accumulated and amortized over future periods and will affect pension expense in future periods 
the following table estimates the future pension expense  based upon current assumptions pension income expense by period in millions qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans the following tables show the impact of a basis point change in the actual return on assets on the pension income expense 
change in pension income expense by period increase decrease basis point increase in investment returns qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans increase decrease basis point decrease in investment returns qualified domestic pension plans international and non qualified pension plans total pension plans other post retirement benefits the company provides post retirement health and life insurance benefits for current retired and active employees and their beneficiaries and covered dependents for certain domestic and international employee groups 
the discount rates adopted by the company for the valuation of the post retirement health care plans were determined using the same methodology as for the pension plans 
an analysis of the duration of the liabilities and future cash flows showed that it was appropriate to use the same discount rates for the post retirement health care plans as were used for the domestic pension plans at november   namely for the domestic plans and a weighted average rate of for the international plans 
as a sensitivity measure  a basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in an immaterial decrease in pre tax earnings for assumed health care cost trend rates are based on past and current health care cost trends  considering such factors as health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances  and the overall health of plan participants 
the company uses health care trend cost rates  which vary by plan  starting with initial levels of for the domestic arrangements and grading down to an ultimate level of 
for the international arrangement  the weighted average initial rate is  grading down to the pre tax post retirement healthcare expense was million in the following table summarizes projected post retirement benefit expense based upon the various assumptions discussed above 
pre tax expense by period in millions domestic and international post retirement benefit plans income taxes income taxes payable reflects the company s current tax provision and management s best estimate of the tax liability relating to the outcome of uncertain tax positions 
if the actual outcome of uncertain tax positions differs from the company s best estimates  an adjustment to income taxes payable could be required  which may result in additional income tax expense or benefit 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax liability or asset is expected to be settled or realized 
the company also records deferred tax assets for the expected future tax benefits of net operating losses and income tax credit carryforwards 
valuation allowances are established when the company determines that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations may not generate sufficient taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets during the carryforward period 
the company considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
thus  changes in future results of operations could result in adjustments to the company s valuation allowances 
tax expense for includes a charge of million relating to earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries where the company has recorded a deferred income tax liability associated with the intent to repatriate those earnings in a subsequent period 
the company had historically considered substantially all of the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested in their operations 
if this deferred tax liability had not been recognized  a valuation allowance for domestic net deferred tax assets would have been required 
the company also has earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries where the company considers these earnings to be permanently reinvested in their operations 
as such  no us tax cost has been provided on approximately million of earnings at december  if the company changes its intent related to these earnings additional tax would be required 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  on january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in tax returns 
under fin no 
 the economic benefit associated with a tax position will only be recognized if it is more likely than not that a tax position ultimately will be sustained 
after this threshold is met  a tax position is reported at the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be ultimately sustained 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of the implementation of fin  the company recognized a million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits

contingencies on an ongoing basis  the company assesses potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against it  including antitrust related matters 
the company accrues for such liabilities when it determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the loss can be made 
determining the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and expense involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates 
in making the determination of likely outcomes of litigation matters  management considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims  the company s experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed  the existence of other defendants  input from outside legal counsel and the current status of the matter 
the company also assesses the likelihood of recovery from insurance  and  in those cases in which realization of an insurance recovery is deemed probable  the company records a corresponding asset 
the company intends to assert all meritorious legal defenses and will pursue all other equitable factors that are available to it with respect to such matters  however  the resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations and cash flows

the company continues to work to improve the productivity of its manufacturing plants and the efficiency of its business processes 
these actions remain focused on improving the operating profitability of its business and increasing the net cash provided by operations 
the company s businesses benefit from a number of trends that provide continued growth opportunities including consumer demand for improved flame retardancy in household goods supported by increasing regulation in many countries worldwide benefits the company s broad range of flame retardant products within the company s polymer additives business segment 
the increasing requirements for cleaner emissions from motor vehicles  greater service life for engines and the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions benefits the company s additive and lubricant product lines within its performance specialties business segment 
the demand for higher yields from specialty high value agricultural crops worldwide benefits the company s crop protection business segment 
consumer demand for ever more effective pool and spa sanitation benefits the company s consumer products business segment 
the company will also face challenges in which may include changes in industrial demand that may result from a slowing in global economic growth as a result of the liquidity difficulties faced by the financial markets in recent months 
a portion of the company s sales are derived from industries such as building and construction  electronics and consumer durables that could be affected by changes in gdp growth 
the company will seek to adjust its cost reduction and manufacturing capacity management to respond to such changes if and when they occur 
continuing increases to raw material and energy costs are anticipated due  in large part  to volatility in the worldwide pricing of precious metal raw materials and natural gas together with the impact of the higher price of oil on hydrocarbon based materials 
the company purchases these materials to manufacture its products 
the company will continue to seek to set prices that reflect the value in use of the company s products and offset as much as possible increases in raw material and energy costs 
however  there can be no assurance that such price increases will be accepted at a level that does offset in full the impact of higher raw material and energy costs 
based upon the known actions the company anticipates it will take in  it provides the following observations the sale of the oleochemicals business will reduce the company s sales in compared to the oleochemicals sales represented approximately of the company s revenues 
the company s focus remains on improving the performance of its polymer additives business and obtaining continued growth in revenues and profitability from its performance specialties  consumer products and crop protection businesses 
expense remaining to be recognized in related to the company s announced restructuring programs is estimated to be approximately million and cash expenditures related to these programs is estimated to be approximately million 
the company expects that the benefits of its cost reduction actions in should generate savings in the order of million in these savings will be reflected in sg a and r d  as well as cost of goods sold 
depreciation and amortization of approximately million  which includes approximately million of additional depreciation due to announced actions that have resulted in a change in the estimated useful life of assets related to certain of the company s manufacturing facilities and erp systems 
capital spending is anticipated to be approximately million reflecting maintenance  health and safety and environmental expenditures  the cost of migrating to a single erp system and a number of growth projects 
dividends paid at the historic rate would be approximately million  reflecting an annual dividend of twenty cents per share 
the company continues to evaluate its manufacturing footprint and business processes seeking further opportunities to reduce cost and increase its operating effectiveness

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s activities expose its earnings  cash flows and financial position to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and energy prices 
the company maintains a risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments as needed to mitigate risk against foreign currency movements and to manage interest rate and energy price volatility 
the company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company has short term exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulting from transactions entered into by the company and its foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currency primarily trade payables and receivables 
the company is also exposed to currency risk on inter company transactions including inter company loans 
the company manages these transactional currency risks on a consolidated basis  which allows it to net its exposure 
the company purchases foreign currency forward contracts  primarily denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  canadian dollars  australian dollars and mexican pesos to hedge its transaction exposure 
these contracts are generally settled on a monthly basis 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in other expense  net  to offset the impact of valuing recorded foreign currency trade payables  receivables and inter company transactions 
the company has not designated these derivatives as hedges under fasb statement no

on derivative instruments and hedging activities  although it believes these instruments help reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency risk 
the net effect of the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these derivatives and the underlying transactions is not significant at december  and the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s long term debt 
weighted average variable interest rates are based on the applicable floating rate index as of december  interest rate sensitivity and fair value in millions thereafter total at long term debt fixed rate debt average rate debt variable rate debt average rate debt a a average interest rate is based on rates in effect at december  the company used price swap contracts as cash flow hedges to convert a portion of its forecasted natural gas purchases from variable price to fixed price purchases 
these contracts are designated as hedges of a portion of the company s forecasted natural gas purchases for a rolling two year period 
these contracts involve the exchange of payments over the life of the contracts without an exchange of the notional amount upon which the payments are based 
the differential paid or received as natural gas prices change is recognized as an adjustment to cost of products sold when the related inventory layer is sold 
the fair value of the contracts at december  resulted in an unrealized loss of less than million  which was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
sensitivity analysis is a technique used to evaluate the impact of hypothetical market value changes 
a hypothetical ten percent increase in the cost of natural gas at december  would result in an increase in the fair market value of the outstanding derivatives by million to an unrealized gain of million  conversely  a hypothetical ten percent decrease in the cost of natural gas would result in a decrease in the fair market value of the outstanding derivatives by million to an unrealized loss of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company ceased the purchase of additional price swap contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted natural gas purchases and established fixed price contracts with physical delivery with its natural gas vendor 
the existing price swap contracts mature through the company has accounts receivable programs to sell accounts receivable to agent banks 
the fees charged for the programs are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
at december   million of domestic accounts receivable have been sold at an average cost of approximately and million of international accounts receivable have been sold at an average cost of approximately 
at december   million of domestic accounts receivable have been sold at an average cost of approximately and million of international accounts receivable have been sold at an average cost of approximately for further information see note accounts receivable programs included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements
