actual results may differ from the company s predictions 
some factors that could cause results to differ are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis  including in the cautionary statement on page the forward looking statements contained in this filing represent management s current estimate as of the date of this filing 
management does not assume any obligation to update these estimates 
reclassifications certain insignificant reclassifications have been made to prior years amounts to conform to the presentation of amounts 
overview the company constitutes one of the largest investor owned health service organizations in the united states 
its subsidiaries are major providers of health care and related benefits  the majority of which are offered through the workplace  including health care products and services such as medical coverages  pharmacy  behavioral health  dental benefits  and disease management  group disability  life and accident insurance  and disability and workers compensation case management and related services 
in addition  the company has an international operation that offers life  accident and supplemental health insurance products and international health care products and services to businesses and individuals in selected markets 
the company also has certain inactive businesses  including a run off reinsurance operation 
see business item in the company s form k for additional information on its segments 
the company generates revenues  net income and cash flow from operations by maintaining and growing its customer base  charging prices that reflect emerging experience  investing available cash at attractive rates of return for appropriate durations  and effectively managing other operating expenses 
the company s ability to increase revenue  net income and operating cash flow is directly related to its ability to address broad economic and industry factors and execute its strategic initiatives  the success of which is measured by certain key factors as discussed below 
key factors affecting the company s results include the ability to profitably price products and services at competitive levels  the volume of customers served and the mix of products and services purchased by those customers  the company s ability to cross sell its various health and related benefit products  the relationship between other operating expenses and revenue  and the effectiveness of the company s capital deployment initiatives 
the company s results are influenced by a range of economic and other factors  especially cost trends and inflation for medical and related services  utilization patterns of medical and other services  employment levels  the tort liability system  developments in the political environment both domestically and internationally  interest rates  equity market returns and foreign currency fluctuations  regulations and tax rules related to the administration of employee benefit plans  and federal and state regulation 
the company regularly monitors the trends impacting operating results from the above mentioned key factors and economic and other factors 
the company develops strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize its competitive position in the markets it serves 
the company s ability to achieve its financial objectives is dependent upon its ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company specific trends 
the company is continuing to improve the performance of and profitably grow the health care operations  as well as continuing to profitably grow the disability and life insurance and international businesses  and managing the risks associated with the run off reinsurance operations 
in the health care businesses  the company has operational improvement initiatives see pages in place to offer products that meet emerging consumer and market trends  underwrite and price products effectively  grow medical membership  effectively manage medical costs  deliver quality member and provider service  maintain and upgrade information technology systems  and reduce other operating expenses 
the company believes that the health care business model is evolving to one that focuses more directly on the role and needs of the health care consumer 
the consumer directed environment presents particular challenges by requiring a more complex service model and products specifically designed to meet the emerging market needs of the consumer 
in order to meet the emerging market challenges  the company is investing in product development  service  technology  educational resources and customer support tools to assist consumers in making more informed choices regarding their health care and to achieve better health outcomes 
these investments and execution of related initiatives are critical to respond to increasing consumer demands 
the company believes that its investments in these areas will position it to more effectively meet emerging market needs and better position the company to be a leader in the health care industry

special items for consisted of a charge associated with the settlement of the shareholder class action lawsuit brought against the company 
this charge included certain costs to defend and was net of expected insurance recoveries  and a charge for severance costs resulting from a review of staffing levels in the health care operations and in supporting areas 
special items for consisted of accelerated amortization of deferred gain on the sale of the retirement benefits business  a charge for severance costs associated with streamlining the operations of the health care operations and supporting areas 
the company substantially completed this program in  a tax benefit primarily from the release of tax reserves and valuation allowances resulting from the completion of the irs audit for years  and a charge associated with a modified coinsurance arrangement resulting from the sale of the retirement benefits business in the impact of these special items on the segments is shown in the results of operations table within each segment discussion 
overview of consolidated results of operations income from continuing operations excluding the special items discussed above decreased in  compared with  principally reflecting lower realized investment gains primarily due to lower gains from sales of equity interests in real estate limited liability entities of million

overview of consolidated results of operations income from continuing operations in  excluding the special items discussed above  increased compared to principally reflecting improved realized investment results primarily due to sales of equity interests in real estate limited liability entities of million after tax  lower losses in the run off reinsurance segment  and higher earnings in the international segment driven by growth in the expatriate employee benefits business and the life  accident and health insurance business 
these factors were partially offset by lower segment earnings in the health care segment see page 
outlook for the company expects full year income from continuing operations  excluding realized investment results  the results of the guaranteed minimum income benefits gmib business and special items  to be higher than the comparable amount primarily due to earnings growth in the health care  disability and life and international segments  tempered by lower earnings in the run off reinsurance segment 
the company s outlook is subject to the factors cited in the cautionary statement on page management is not able to estimate income from continuing operations under generally accepted accounting principles because it includes realized investment gains losses  the results of the gmib business and special items 
information is not available for management to reasonably estimate future realized investment gains losses  the results of the gmib business under a new accounting standard see note b to the consolidated financial statements or special non recurring items  due  in part  to interest rate and stock market volatility and other internal and external factors

premiums and fees decreased marginally in reflecting the loss of a large prescription drug contract of billion 
excluding the loss of this contract  premiums and fees increased in  compared with primarily due to membership growth and rate increases in the health care  disability and life and international segments see pages net investment income net investment income decreased in this decrease was primarily attributable to share repurchase activity and lower average assets driven by a decline in the health care segment resulting from a shift in business from guaranteed cost products to administrative services only aso products  and pre funding of medicare part d claims 
net investment income decreased in as a result of the conversion of the single premium annuity business to indemnity reinsurance see page for additional information and share repurchase activity 
net investment income also reflects the impact of yields  which were lower in and higher in as a result of changes in interest rates 
mail order pharmacy revenues mail order pharmacy revenues in were comparable to mail order pharmacy revenues increased in  compared with  primarily due to higher volume 
other revenues other revenues for the company include certain health care specialty products  including behavioral health and disease management  results from futures contracts in the run off reinsurance operations and amortization of deferred gains associated with sold businesses 
other revenues increased in  as compared with  primarily due to lower losses from futures contracts in the run off reinsurance operations partially offset by lower other revenues in the disability and life segment see page 
other revenues decreased in  as compared with  primarily due to lower deferred gain amortization associated with the sold retirement benefits business and higher losses from futures contracts in the run off reinsurance operations

critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition to the estimates presented in the following table  there are other accounting estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  including estimates of liabilities for future policy benefits other than those identified in the following table  as well as estimates with respect to unpaid claims and claim expenses  postemployment and postretirement benefits other than pensions  certain compensation accruals  and income taxes 
management believes the current assumptions used to estimate amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions used in estimating amounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations  and in certain situations  could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact the company 
the table that follows presents information about the company s most critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 
balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used future policy benefits guaranteed minimum death benefits these liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to be paid  less the present value of net future premiums expected to be received 
the amounts to be paid represent the excess of the guaranteed death benefit over the values of contractholders accounts 
the death benefit coverage in force at december  representing the amount payable if all approximately  contractholders had died as of that date was approximately billion 
liabilities for future policy benefits for these contracts as of december were as follows million million the company estimates these liabilities based on assumptions for lapse  partial surrender  mortality  interest rates mean investment performance and discount rate  and volatility 
these assumptions are based on the company s experience and future expectations over the long term period 
the company monitors actual experience to update these estimates as necessary 
lapse refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to a contractholder s death 
partial surrender refers to the fact that most contractholders have the ability to withdraw substantially all of their mutual fund investments while retaining any available death benefit coverage in effect at the time of the withdrawal 
equity market declines could expose the company to higher rates of partial surrender  the effect of which is not covered by the company s program to substantially reduce market risks 
interest rates include both a the mean investment performance assumption considering the company s program to reduce equity market exposures using futures contracts  and b the liability discount rate assumption 
volatility refers to market fluctuations that affect the costs of the program adopted by the company to reduce equity market risks associated with these liabilities 
current assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if an unfavorable change were to occur to those assumptions  the approximate after tax decrease in net income would be as follows increase in mortality rates million decrease in lapse rates million increase in future partial surrenders million basis point decrease in interest rates mean investment performance million discount rate million increase in volatility million the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment 
health care medical claims payable medical claims payable for the health care segment include both reported claims and estimates for losses incurred but not yet reported 
liabilities for medical claims payable as of december were as follows gross million  net million gross million  net million gross billion  net million these liabilities are presented above both gross and net of reinsurance and other recoverables 
these liabilities generally exclude amounts for administrative services only business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company develops estimates for health care medical claims payable using actuarial principles and assumptions based on historical and projected claim payment patterns  medical cost trends  which are impacted by the utilization of medical services and the related costs of the services provided unit costs  benefit design  seasonality  and other relevant operational factors 
the company consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each reporting period  with consideration given to the variability of these factors  and recognizes the actuarial best estimate of the ultimate liability within a level of confidence  as required by actuarial standards of practice  which require that the liabilities be adequate under moderately adverse conditions 
the company s estimate of the liability for medical claims incurred but not yet reported is primarily calculated using historical claim payment patterns and expected medical cost trends 
the company analyzes the historical claim payment patterns by comparing the dates claims were incurred  generally the dates services were provided  to the dates claims were paid to determine completion factors  which are a measure of the time to process claims 
a completion factor is calculated for each month of incurred claims 
the company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors 
the company estimates the ultimate liability for claims incurred in each month by applying the current estimates of completion factors to the current paid claim data 
the difference between this estimate of the ultimate liability and the current paid claim data is the estimate of the remaining claims to be paid for each incurral month 
these monthly estimates are aggregated and included in the company s health care medical claims payable at the end of each for the year ended december   actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions  resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims payable of of the current year incurred claims as reported for the year ended december  for the year ended december   actual experience differed from the company s key assumptions  resulting in million of favorable incurred claims related to prior years medical claims  or of the current year incurred claims reported for the year ended december  specifically  the favorable impact is due to faster than expected completion factors and lower than expected medical cost trends  both of which included an assumption for moderately adverse experience 
the corresponding impact of favorable prior year development on net income was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the change in the amount of the incurred claims related to prior years in the medical claims payable liability does not directly correspond to an increase or decrease in the company s net income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
recent variances were for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  related to the impact of the prior year medical claims payable  and for the year ended december  and for the year reporting period 
completion factors are used to estimate the health care medical claims payable for all months where claims have not been completely resolved and paid  except for the most recent month as described below 
completion factors are impacted by several key items including changes in the level of claims processed electronically versus manually auto adjudication  changes in provider claims submission rates  membership changes and the mix of products 
as noted  the company uses historical completion factors combined with an analysis of current trends and operational factors to develop current estimates of completion factors 
this approach implicitly assumes that historical completion rates will be a useful indicator for the current period 
it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns  which could have a material impact on the company s medical claims payable and net income 
claims incurred in the most recent month have limited paid claim data  since a large portion of health care claims are not submitted to the company for payment in the month services have been provided 
this makes the completion factor approach less reliable for claims incurred in the most recent month 
as a result  in any reporting period  for the estimates of the ultimate claims incurred in the most recent month  the company primarily relies on medical cost trend analysis  which reflects expected claim payment patterns and other relevant operational considerations 
medical cost trend is impacted by several key factors including medical service utilization and unit costs and the company s ability to manage these factors through benefit design  underwriting  provider contracting and the company s medical management initiatives 
these factors are affected by changes in the level and mix of medical benefits offered  including inpatient  outpatient and pharmacy  the impact of copays and deductibles  changes in provider practices and changes in consumer demographics and consumption behavior 
because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends  the trend experienced for the most recent history along with an analysis of emerging trends  have been taken into consideration in establishing the liability for medical claims payable at december  and it is possible that the actual medical trend for the current period will develop differently from the expected  which could have a material impact on the company s medical claims payable and net income 
for each reporting period  the company evaluates key assumptions by comparing the assumptions used in establishing the medical claims payable to actual experience 
when actual experience differs from the assumptions used in establishing the liability  medical claims payable are increased or decreased through current period net income 
additionally  the company evaluates expected future developments and emerging trends which may impact key assumptions 
the estimation process involves considerable judgment  reflecting the variability inherent in forecasting future claim payments 
the adequacy of these estimates is highly sensitive to changes in the company s key assumptions  specifically completion factors  which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the submission and payment of medical claims  and medical cost trends  which are impacted by actual or expected changes in the utilization of medical services and unit costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
ended december  related to the impact on net income 
the company believes that based on the current mix of business as of december   relative to the health care medical claims payable  the annual impact of each variance between the actual and expected incurred medical claims on the company s net income would be approximately million  favorable or unfavorable dependent on the direction of the actual versus expected variance 
based on the current mix of business  the company would reasonably expect the variance between actual and expected incurred medical claims to be within the range of to 
this potential variance is expected to be driven evenly by completion factors and monthly medical cost trends 
while these ranges are consistent with the more recent variation in actual completion factors and medical trend assumptions  including the impact of recent operational and environmental changes  there is significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate outcome of actual results versus individual assumptions  and accordingly  more precision is not appropriate 
the amounts would be reflected in the health care segment 
balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  and other assets guaranteed minimum income benefits these liabilities are estimates of the present value of net amounts expected to be paid  less the present value of net future premiums expected to be received 
the amounts to be paid represent the excess of the expected value of the income benefit over the value of the annuitants accounts at the time of annuitization 
the assets associated with these contracts represent receivables in connection with reinsurance that the company has purchased from two external reinsurers  which covers of the exposures on these contracts 
net liabilities related to these contracts as of december were as follows million million as of december  net amounts recoverable related to these contracts from two external reinsurers were as follows million million additional liabilities associated with the cost of reinsurance as of december were as follows million million as discussed in note b to the consolidated financial statements  the company will implement sfas no 
 fair value measurements  on january  the new requirements that focus on exit price to measure fair value will impact the current assumptions and resulting estimated fair value of assets and liabilities for guaranteed minimum income benefits and are expected to reduce the company s net income at implementation between million to million  net of estimated reinsurance recoverable 
the company estimates the fair value of the assets and liabilities associated with these contracts using assumptions as to market returns and volatility of the underlying equity and bond mutual fund investments  interest rates  mortality  lapse  credit risk and annuity election rates 
changes in fair value are reported in other operating expenses 
annuity election rates refer to the proportion of annuitants who elect to receive their income benefit as an annuity 
lapse refers to the full surrender of an annuity prior to annuitization of the policy 
the company has been monitoring annuity election rate experience and  in  increased its assumption related to annuity election rates resulting in a charge net of reinsurance of million pre tax 
also in  the company completed a review of lapse experience for these contracts 
as a result of the review  the company decreased its lapse assumption resulting in a charge net of reinsurance of million pre tax  because fewer annuitants are expected to lapse coverage  the company s expected claims increase 
in combination  the company recognized in the second quarter of a total charge of million after tax million pre tax for these changes in the long term assumptions 
this charge is reflected as a special item see page 
credit risk refers to the ability of these reinsurers to pay 
interest rates include both a the liability discount rate assumption and b the projected interest rates used to calculate the reinsured income benefit at the time of annuitization claim interest rate 
volatility refers to the degree of variation of future market returns of the underlying mutual fund investments 
after implementation of sfas  the company will consider the various assumptions used to estimate fair values of assets and liabilities associated with these contracts in two categories 
the first group of assumptions consists of future annuitant behavior including annuity election rates  lapse  and mortality as well as retrocessionnaire credit risk 
current assumptions used to estimate these liabilities are detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company will estimate a hypothetical market participant s view of these assumptions considering the actual and expected experience of the company and other relevant and available industry sources 
if an unfavorable change were to occur in these assumptions before the implementation of sfas no 
 the approximate after tax decrease in net income  net of estimated reinsurance recoverable  would be as follows decrease in mortality less than million increase in annuity election rates million decrease in lapse rates million decrease in amounts recoverable from reinsurers credit risk million after the implementation of sfas no 
 the potential effects on net income of unfavorable changes in these assumptions are generally expected to be to more than noted above  primarily because the liabilities  net of reinsurance recoverable will be higher at the date of implementation 
in addition to these assumptions  the company will estimate a risk and profit charge that a hypothetical market participant would require to assume this business 
the second group of assumptions used to estimate these fair values consist of capital markets inputs including market returns and discount rates  claim interest rates and market volatility 
after the implementation of sfas no 
 the company s results of operations are expected to be more volatile in future periods because these assumptions will be based largely on market observable inputs at the close of each period including risk free interest rates and market implied volatilities 
if the following unfavorable changes were to occur after the implementation of sfas no 
on january   the approximate after tax decrease in net income  net of estimated reinsurance recoverable  would be as follows basis point decrease in risk free interest rates which are aligned with libor used for projecting market returns and discounting to million basis point decrease in interest rates used for projecting claim exposure year treasury rates million increase in market volatility million in addition  if annuitants account values as of december  declined by due to the performance of the underlying mutual funds  the approximate after tax decrease in net income net of estimated reinsurance recoverable would be approximately million 
all of these estimated impacts due to unfavorable changes could vary from quarter to quarter depending on actual reserve levels  the actual market conditions or changes in the anticipated view of a hypothetical market participant as of any future valuation date 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables in run off reinsurance collectibility of reinsurance recoverables requires an assessment of risks that such amounts will not be collected  including risks associated with reinsurer default and disputes with reinsurers regarding applicable coverage 
gross and net reinsurance recoverables in the run off reinsurance segment as of december  were as follows gross million  net million gross million  net million gross million  net million the amount of reinsurance recoverables in the run off reinsurance segment  net of reserves  represents management s best estimate of recoverability  including an assessment of the financial strength of reinsurers 
the ultimate amounts received are dependent  in certain cases  on the resolution of disputes with reinsurers  including the outcome of arbitration and litigation proceedings 
a reduction of net reinsurance recoverables due to uncollectibility at december   would reduce net income by approximately million after tax 
the amounts would be reflected in the run off reinsurance segment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities pension liabilities these liabilities are estimates of the present value of the qualified and nonqualified pension benefits to be paid attributed to employee service to date net of the fair value of plan assets 
the accrued pension benefit liability as of december was as follows million million see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company estimates these liabilities with actuarial models using various assumptions including discount rates and an expected return on plan assets 
discount rates are set considering actual annualized yields for high quality  long term corporate bonds  adjusted to reflect the duration of the pension liabilities 
the expected return on plan assets for the domestic qualified pension plan is developed considering actual historical returns  current and expected market conditions  plan asset mix and management s investment strategy 
in addition  to measure pension costs the company uses a market related asset value method for domestic qualified pension plan assets invested in non fixed income investments  which are approximately of total plan assets 
this method recognizes market appreciation or depreciation in the non fixed income portfolio over years  a method that reduces the short term impact of market fluctuations on pension cost 
the declining interest rate environment has resulted in an accumulated unrecognized actuarial loss of billion at december  the actuarial loss adjusted for unrecognized changes in market related asset values is amortized over the remaining service life of pension plan participants if the loss exceeds of the market related value of plan assets or of the projected benefit obligation  whichever is greater 
as of december   approximately billion of the adjusted actuarial loss exceeded of the projected benefit obligation 
as a result  approximately million after tax will be expensed in net income 
for the year ended december   million after tax was expensed in net income 
changes to the company s assumptions for discount rates and the expected return on domestic qualified plan assets will not change required cash contributions to the pension plan  as the company funds at least the minimum amount required by erisa 
using past experience  the company expects that it is reasonably possible that a favorable or unfavorable change in these key assumptions of basis points could occur 
an unfavorable change is a decrease in these key assumptions with resulting impacts as discussed below 
if discount rates for the qualified and nonqualified pension plans decreased by basis points annual pension costs for would increase by approximately million  after tax  and the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million as of december  if the expected return on domestic qualified pension plan assets decreased by basis points  annual pension costs for would increase by approximately million  after tax 
if the december  fair values of domestic qualified plan assets decreased by  the accrued pension benefit liability would increase by approximately million as of december  resulting in an after tax decrease to shareholders equity of approximately million 
a favorable change is an increase in these key assumptions and would result in impacts to annual pension costs  the accrued pension liability and shareholders equity in an opposite direction  but similar amounts 
balance sheet caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect if different assumptions used investments fixed maturities recognition of losses from other than temporary impairments of public and private placement fixed maturities losses for other than temporary impairments of fixed maturities must be recognized in net income based on an estimate of fair value by management 
changes in fair value are reflected as an increase or decrease in shareholders equity 
a decrease in fair value is recognized in net income when the decrease is determined to be other than temporary 
determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary includes an evaluation of the reasons for and the significance of the decrease in value of the security as well as the duration of the decrease 
management estimates the amount of an other than temporary impairment when a decline in value is expected to persist  using quoted market prices for public securities with active markets and generally the present value of future cash flows for private placement bonds and other public securities 
expected future cash flows are based on historical experience of the issuer and management s expectation of future performance 
see quality ratings on page for additional information 
the company recognized other than temporary impairments of investments in fixed maturities as follows after tax  excluding policyholder share million million million see note a to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s review of declines in fair value 
for all fixed maturities with cost in excess of their fair value  if this excess was determined to be other than temporary  the company s net income as of december  would have decreased by approximately million after tax 
for private placement bonds considered impaired  a decrease of of all expected future cash flows for the impaired bonds would reduce net income by approximately million after tax 
segment results of operations operating segments generally reflect groups of related products  but the international segment is generally based on geography 
the company measures the financial results of its segments using segment earnings loss  which is defined as income loss from continuing operations excluding realized investment gains losses 
beginning in  the company reports the results of the run off retirement business in other operations 
prior periods have been restated to conform to this presentation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional segment information and a reconciliation of segment earnings loss to the company s consolidated income from continuing operations 
health care segment segment description the health care segment includes medical  dental  behavioral health  prescription drug and other products and services that may be integrated to provide consumers with comprehensive health care solutions 
this segment also includes group disability and life insurance products that were historically sold in connection with certain experience rated medical products that continue to be managed within the health care business 
these products and services are offered through guaranteed cost  retrospectively experience rated and service funding arrangements 
for a description of funding arrangements  see page in this form k 
the company measures the operating effectiveness of the health care segment using the following key factors segment earnings  membership growth  sales of specialty products to core medical customers  changes in operating expenses per member  and medical expense as a percentage of premiums medical cost ratio in the guaranteed cost business 
results of operations in millions financial summary premiums and fees net investment income mail order pharmacy revenues other revenues segment revenues mail order pharmacy cost of goods sold benefits and other expenses benefits and expenses income before taxes income taxes segment earnings realized investment gains  net of taxes special item after tax included in segment earnings cost reduction charge the health care segment s earnings in all years presented were impacted by favorable after tax prior year claim development of million  million and million  in  and  respectively 
the amount of prior year claim development recorded in  compared with  is lower due to actual medical cost trends and completion factors being more in line with initial assumptions 
the amount of prior year claim development recorded in and in was attributable to better than expected completion factors reflecting shorter claims processing times due to more timely submission of claims as well as higher auto adjudication rates 
additionally  lower than expected medical cost trends also contributed to the favorable results 
these results were driven by lower inpatient  outpatient and pharmacy service utilization and successful provider contracting initiatives as well as the mix of services provided 
excluding such prior year claim development and the special items noted in the table above  segment earnings in increased over due to increased earnings from the specialty businesses  margin improvements in the stop loss product  a lower medical cost ratio in the guaranteed cost business of basis points due to strong renewal pricing increases in excess of medical cost trend  and aggregate medical membership growth of approximately  members  including growth in the voluntary limited benefits business 
these factors were partially offset by lower margins in the experience rated business as well as lower net investment income due to lower average assets and lower yields 
excluding prior year claim development and the special items noted in the table above  segment earnings for were higher than due to higher earnings from the specialty businesses associated with core medical members  higher medical membership of approximately  members  improved cost productivity from expense reduction initiatives reflected in lower operating costs per member  and lower losses in the medicare part d program of million after tax 
these factors were partially offset by lower results in the guaranteed cost business reflecting premium increases which were less than medical cost increases and lower experience rated earnings 
revenues the table below shows premiums and fees for the health care segment in millions medical commercial hmo open access other guaranteed cost voluntary limited benefits total guaranteed cost experience rated medical  dental medicare medicare part d other medical total medical life and other non medical total premiums fees  total premiums and fees premiums and or fees associated with certain specialty products are also included 
includes premiums of million for associated with the health care members in tucson  arizona see medical membership below 
includes premiums associated with other risk related products primarily open access products 
includes minimum premium members  who have a risk profile similar to experience rated funding arrangements 
the risk portion of minimum premium revenue is reported in experience rated medical premium whereas the self funding portion of minimum premium revenue is recorded in fees 
other medical premiums include risk revenue for stop loss and specialty products 
represent administrative service fees for medical members and related specialty product fees for non medical members as well as fees related to medicare part d 
premiums and fees 
premiums and fees increased in  compared with  primarily reflecting strong renewal pricing on existing business  particularly in the guaranteed cost business  higher medicare part d premiums of million  growth in specialty revenues  and aggregate medical membership growth  including the voluntary limited benefits business 
in addition  premiums and fees in reflect a change in the mix of products to more service only products from guaranteed cost products 
premiums and fees reflect the loss in of a large prescription drug contract of billion in the experience rated business 
the loss of this contract had minimal impact to earnings  however the final settlement of this contract did result in net cash outflows in excluding the loss of this contract  premiums and fees increased by in  compared with  primarily due to increased guaranteed cost membership and rate increases  as well as premiums and fees associated with the medicare part d and voluntary limited benefits businesses 
other revenues

solvency regulation 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic utilizes risk based capital rbc standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company s adjusted surplus to its required surplus rbc ratio 
the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies 
within certain ratio ranges  regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases 
there are four levels of regulatory action  ranging from requiring insurers to submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control 
at december   the rbc ratio of each of the company s primary insurance subsidiaries was above the level that would require regulatory action 
the rbc framework described above for insurers has been extended by the naic to health organizations  including hmos 
although not all states have adopted these rules at december   at that date  each of the company s active hmos had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or  where adopted  the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic s rbc rules 
external rating agencies use their own rbc standards to evaluate capital adequacy as part of determining a company s rating 
the naic is considering changing statutory reserving rules for variable annuities 
any changes would apply to the company s reinsurance contracts covering guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum income benefits  and would impact the company s overall surplus level 
contractual obligations the company  through its subsidiaries  is contingently liable for various contractual obligations entered into in the ordinary course of business 
the maturities of the company s principal contractual cash obligations  as of december   are estimated to be as follows in millions  on an undiscounted basis total less than year years years after years on balance sheet insurance liabilities contractholder deposit funds future policy benefits health care medical claims payable unpaid claims and claims expenses short term debt long term debt non recourse obligations other long term liabilities off balance sheet purchase obligations operating leases total on balance sheet insurance liabilities 
contractual cash obligations for insurance liabilities  excluding unearned premiums and fees  represent estimated net benefit payments for health  life and disability insurance policies and annuity contracts 
actual obligations in any single year will vary based on actual morbidity  mortality  lapse  withdrawal and premium experience 
the sum of the obligations presented above exceeds the corresponding insurance liabilities of billion recorded on the balance sheet because these recorded liabilities reflect discounting for interest 
the company manages its investment portfolios to generate cash flows needed to satisfy contractual obligations 
any shortfall from expected yields could result in increases to recorded reserves and adversely impact results of operations 
the amounts associated with the sold retirement benefits and individual life insurance and annuity businesses are excluded from the table above as net cash flow associated with them are not expected to impact the company 
the total amount of these reinsured reserves excluded is approximately billion 
short term debt represents current obligations under capital leases 
long term debt includes scheduled interest payments 
capital leases are included in long term debt and represent obligations for software licenses 
non recourse obligations represent principal and interest payments due which may be limited to the value of specified assets  such as real estate properties held in joint ventures 
other long term liabilities

fixed maturities investments in fixed maturities bonds include publicly traded and privately placed debt securities  mortgage and other asset backed securities and preferred stocks redeemable by the investor 
fixed maturities  as presented on the balance sheet  also include trading and hybrid securities 
in millions federal government and agency state and local government foreign government corporate federal agency mortgage backed other mortgage backed other asset backed total other mortgage backed assets consist principally of commercial mortgage backed securities of which million were residential mortgages and home equity lines of credit  all of which were originated utilizing standard underwriting practices and are not considered sub prime loans 
quality ratings as of december   billion  or  of the fixed maturities in the company s investment portfolio were investment grade baa and above  or equivalent  and the remaining billion were below investment grade 
most of the bonds that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non investment grade spectrum 
private placement investments are generally less marketable than public bonds  but yields on these investments tend to be higher than yields on publicly offered debt with comparable credit risk 
the fair value of private placement investments was billion as of december   and billion as of december  the company maintains controls on its participation in private placement investments 
in particular  the company performs a credit analysis of each issuer  diversifies investments by industry and issuer and requires financial and other covenants that allow the company to monitor issuers for deteriorating financial strength so the company can take remedial actions  if warranted 
see critical accounting estimates on page for additional information 
because of the higher yields and the inherent risk associated with privately placed investments and below investment grade securities  gains or losses from such investments could affect future results of operations 
however  management does not expect such gains or losses to be material to the company s liquidity or financial condition 
commercial mortgage loans the company s commercial mortgage loans are made exclusively to commercial borrowers  therefore there is no exposure to either prime or sub prime residential mortgages 
these fixed rate loans are diversified by property type  location and borrower to reduce exposure to potential losses 
loans are secured by the related property and are generally made at less than of the property s value 
the company routinely monitors and evaluates the status of its commercial mortgage loans by reviewing loan and property related information  including cash flows  expiring leases  financial health of the borrower and major tenants  loan payment history  occupancy and room rates for hotels and market conditions 
the company evaluates this information in light of current economic conditions as well as geographic and property type considerations 
problem and potential problem investments problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are either delinquent by days or more or have been restructured as to terms interest rate or maturity date 
potential problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans are fully current  but management believes they have certain characteristics that increase the likelihood that they may become problems 
these characteristics include  but are not limited to  the following request from the borrower for restructuring  principal or interest payments past due by more than but fewer than days  downgrade in credit rating  deterioration in debt service ratio  collateral losses on asset backed securities  and significant vacancy in commercial rental mortgage property  or a decline in sales for commercial retail mortgage property 
the company recognizes interest income on problem bonds and commercial mortgage loans only when payment is actually received because of the risk profile of the underlying investment 
the amount that would have been reflected in net income if interest on non accrual investments had been recognized in accordance with the original terms was not significant in  or the following table shows problem and potential problem investments at amortized cost as of december in millions gross reserve net problem bonds potential problem bonds potential problem commercial mortgage loans foreclosed real estate problem bonds potential problem bonds potential problem commercial mortgage loans foreclosed real estate summary the effect of investment asset write downs and changes in valuation reserves on the company s net income are shown below 
other includes amounts attributable to future policy benefits for certain annuities and a modified coinsurance arrangement associated with the sold retirement benefits business prior to its conversion to indemnity reinsurance in april in millions cigna other the company s portion of these losses is a component of realized investment results 
sustained weaknesses in certain sectors of the economy and the possibility of rising interest rates for an extended period may cause additional investment losses 
these investment losses could materially affect future results of operations  although the company does not currently expect them to have a material effect on its liquidity or financial condition 
market risk financial instruments the company s assets and liabilities include financial instruments subject to the risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company s primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed rate  domestic  medium term instruments 
changes in market interest rates affect the value of instruments that promise a fixed return and impact the value of liabilities for reinsured guaranteed minimum death and income benefit contracts 
foreign currency exchange rate risk of the us dollar to the south korean won  taiwan dollar  british pound  euro  hong kong dollar and new zealand dollar 
an unfavorable change in exchange rates reduces the carrying value of net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
equity price risk for domestic equity securities and for reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum death or income benefits resulting from unfavorable changes in variable annuity account values based on underlying mutual fund investments 
see notes and b to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of guaranteed minimum death benefits and guaranteed minimum income benefit contracts  respectively 
the company s management of market risks the company predominantly relies on three techniques to manage its exposure to market risk investment liability matching 
the company generally selects investment assets with characteristics such as duration  yield  currency and liquidity that correspond to the underlying characteristics of its related insurance and contractholder liabilities so that the company can match the investments to its obligations 
shorter term investments support generally shorter term life and health liabilities 
medium term  fixed rate investments support interest sensitive and health liabilities 
longer term investments generally support products with longer pay out periods such as annuities and long term disability liabilities 
use of local currencies for foreign operations 
the company generally conducts its international business through foreign operating entities that maintain assets and liabilities in local currencies 
this substantially limits exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies 
use of derivatives 
the company generally uses derivative financial instruments to minimize certain market risks and enhance investment returns 
see notes c and f to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments 
effect of market fluctuations on the company the examples that follow illustrate the effect of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair value of certain financial instruments including hypothetical changes in market rates for interest and foreign currencies primarily for fixed maturities and commercial mortgage loans  and hypothetical changes in market prices for equity exposures primarily for equity securities and contracts that guarantee minimum income benefits 
in addition  hypothetical effects of changes in equity indices and foreign exchange rates are presented separately for futures contracts used in a program for guaranteed minimum death benefits 
management believes that actual results could differ materially from these examples because these examples were developed using estimates and assumptions  changes in the fair values of all insurance related assets and liabilities have been excluded because their primary risks are insurance rather than market risk  changes in the fair values of investments recorded using the equity method of accounting and liabilities for pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit plans and related assets have been excluded  consistent with the disclosure guidance  and changes in the fair values of other significant assets and liabilities such as goodwill  deferred acquisition costs  taxes  and various accrued liabilities have been excluded  because they are not financial instruments  their primary risks are other than market risk 
the effects of hypothetical changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of certain of the company s financial instruments  subject to the exclusions noted above particularly insurance liabilities  would have been as follows as of december market scenario for certain noninsurance financial instruments loss in fair value basis point increase in interest rates million million strengthening in us dollar to foreign currencies million million decrease in market prices for equity exposures million million the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates on the fair value of certain of the company s financial instruments decreased in as a result of declining investments in commercial mortgage loans and shortening durations of fixed maturity investments supporting certain annuities and increased long term debt 
the effect of a hypothetical decrease in market prices for equity exposures increased in as a result of increased net liabilities related to guaranteed minimum income benefits reinsured by the company based on higher assumed annuity election rates 
see critical accounting estimates for guaranteed minimum income benefit benefits on page for further discussion 
the effect of a hypothetical increase in interest rates was determined by estimating the present value of future cash flows using various models  primarily duration modeling 
the effect of a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies held by the company was estimated to be of the us dollar equivalent fair value 
the effect of a hypothetical decrease in the market prices of equity exposures was estimated based on a decrease in the mutual fund values underlying guaranteed minimum income benefits reinsured by the company and a decrease in the value of equity securities held by the company 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the company uses futures contracts as part of a program to substantially reduce the effect of equity market changes on certain reinsurance contracts that guarantee minimum death benefits based on unfavorable changes in variable annuity account values 
the hypothetical effect of a increase in the s p  s p  russell  nasdaq  topix japanese  eurostoxx and ftse british equity indices and a weakening in the us dollar to the japanese yen  british pound and euro would have been a decrease of approximately million in the fair value of the futures contracts outstanding under this program as of december  a corresponding decrease in liabilities for guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts would result from the hypothetical increase in these equity indices and weakening in the us dollar 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this program and related guaranteed minimum death benefit contracts 
as noted above  the company manages its exposure to market risk by matching investment characteristics to its obligations 
stock market performance the performance of equity markets can have a significant effect on the company s businesses  including on risks and exposures associated with guaranteed minimum death benefit see note to the consolidated financial statements and income benefit contracts see note b to the consolidated financial statements  and pension liabilities since equity securities comprise a significant portion of the assets of the company s employee pension plans see page cautionary statement for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company and its representatives may from time to time make written and oral forward looking statements  including statements contained in press releases  in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  in its reports to shareholders and in meetings with analysts and investors
