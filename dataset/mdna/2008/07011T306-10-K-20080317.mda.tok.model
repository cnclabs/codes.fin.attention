item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under item a 
risk factors  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward looking statements 
overview we are providers of reliable  long term process solutions for a range of customers which include designing  building  implementing and servicing systems for the treatment of contaminated groundwater  the treatment of wastewater  waste reduction and resource recovery 
we were initially incorporated in december and during our first two years of operations primarily focused on the development of our ion exchange regenerable  onsite treatment system 
the first permit to be issued by the california department of health services  or dhs  to one of our customers for the operation of our system was issued in we currently have systems on order or under contract in california  arizona  north carolina and new jersey with an aggregate installed capacity of approximately  acre feet per year  or approximately billion gallons per year 
in  we marketed our treatment systems and services primarily to utilities  cities  municipalities  special districts  real estate developers and other organizations for use in treating groundwater that does not comply with federal or state drinking water regulations due to the presence of chemical contaminants 
we marketed our treatment systems and services through our direct sales force  independent contractors and strategic relationships 
our customers include arizona american water  aqua america  california water service group and american states water company  four of the largest investor owned water utilities in the united states based on population served 
as a manufacturer of treatment systems  our operations necessitate a significant investment in receivables and property and require significant working capital 
in the case of sales of ion exchange regenerable  onsite treatment systems  we must expend all of the costs to build and deliver our system to the customer  and we receive payment for the system primarily when the delivery is completed and the system has been placed into service 
for systems that we deliver to customers under our long term contract arrangements  we must incur the costs to build and deliver our treatment systems  and we receive payment over a typical period of five or more years 
in may  we completed our initial public offering which resulted in the issuance of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million 
on september   we completed the acquisition of mobile process technology co 
mpt  a provider of technology and services to the water treatment and industrial process markets 
this acquisition provides additional capabilities including expanded technological solutions  geographic presence and expanded customer base 
the new company provides the ability to service and treat smaller capacity water systems than our product offering 
outlook we believe that the following trends and uncertainties  among others  may impact our revenues  income  liquidity and cash flows the success of our internal marketing and sales organization in developing new customers and placing our treatment systems through sales or long term contracts  which would increase our revenues  
table of contents our success in placing our treatment systems throughout the nation pursuant to strategic relationships  expansion of our marketing and sales organization  expansion of our regional structure which would increase our revenues and may decrease our customer concentration and associated risk  public awareness of the effects of groundwater contamination  which may increase demand for our groundwater treatment systems  changes in federal and state government regulation with respect to drinking water standards which may impact demand for our arsenic treatment systems  the potential increase in demand for placement of our systems through long term contracts rather than sales  which will likely require higher capital expenditures and adversely affect our liquidity  changes in federal and state government regulation of discharge requirements for wastewater may impact our demand for wastewater treatment systems and services  changes in commodity prices  particularly commodities that might be recoverable from waste streams  may impact the demand for our resource recovery system and services  changes in general economic conditions which may affect capital expenditures in our markets and demand for our treatment systems and services  acceptance by potential customers to utilize third parties for water and wastewater treatment  waste reduction and resource recovery services  including through long term service agreements  continued expansion of our workforce resulting in increased expenses but also supporting our growth  and increased utilization and productivity of our personnel  which we anticipate will positively impact our gross profit under our contract revenues 
financial operations review we evaluate our business using a variety of key financial measures revenues our revenues tend to vary from period to period  because customers can choose between purchasing our groundwater treatment systems and entering into long term contract arrangements for our treatment systems 
if a customer chooses to purchase a system  we recognize revenues over a much shorter period of time  generally within one or two quarters  than we would recognize for the same system if the customer chose a long term contract arrangement for the system 
thus  our revenues will tend to be higher in periods in which we sell rather than place our systems under long term contracts 
for any customers selecting a long term capital arrangement  we may enter into third party financing arrangements 
sales for treatment systems sold to customers which are sold under fixed price contracts  or that we enter into a sale under a third party financing arrangement  we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion method 
this method takes into account the cost  estimated earnings and revenues to date on systems not yet completed 
this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available method of measuring progress on systems sold to customers 
in general  financial statements based on the percentage of completion method present the economic substance of production type activities more clearly than the completed contract method  and present the relationships between sales  cost of sales and related period costs more accurately 
because of inherent uncertainties in estimating costs  estimates used may change in the near term 
such estimates are adjusted under the cumulative catch up method 
unless contractually agreed to otherwise  the sales contract is deemed to be substantially complete when the treatment system has been physically completed and a performance test has been passed 
historically  our sales consisted of large system 
table of contents sales and standard system sales 
our large systems consisted of large site regenerable treatment systems that we constructed at our customer s site as opposed to standard systems which are fabricated at our facilities 
contract revenues our recurring contract revenues are generated from three sources 
the first source of recurring contract revenues is from long term fixed contracts under which we install our system at the customer s site and treat the customer s water 
we retain ownership of the installed system 
under this contract we recognize monthly revenues on a straight line basis over the life of the contract  which represents a return of the capital value of the installed system 
the amount of this fixed monthly revenue is based on both the capacity of the system and the type of contaminant s being treated 
the straight line method best reflects the value of having the system s capacity available to the customer at all times and is similar to the method used for calculating depreciation 
the second source of recurring revenues is from long term contracts for the treatment of the water produced from installed treatment systems  which we also refer to as service revenues 
service revenues are recognized based on the actual volume of water treated each month 
such water treatment revenues bear a direct relationship to the variable costs for the purchase and delivery of salt  chemicals and resin used in the system  the removal of waste and the cost to maintain and service the system 
this revenue stream is generated both by systems that were purchased by our customers and by systems in which we retain ownership and recognize revenue for the monthly capital component 
the third source of contract revenues relates to providing other services for the processing of water  replacement of resins or equipment parts and other water treatment related services 
under each of the long term contracts  the customer is typically obligated to pay us for the treatment of its water not for specific hours worked  supplies purchased or waste hauls provided 
our newer long term contracts allow us to recover increased operating costs  including costs for salt  chemicals  resin and removal of waste 
most of our contracts entered into prior to do not have such provisions 
under the criteria set forth in eitf  we have determined that the multiple deliverables of each of our long term contracts specifically  the capital component and the volume related service charge  qualify for separate accounting treatment 
the three criteria required for separate accounting treatment are that each deliverable has a standalone value to the customer  that there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of each deliverable and that there are no general refund rights for the deliverables 
in the case of contracts under which we own the system  the customer is obligated to pay us the fixed capital component of the system on a monthly basis 
these arrangements are classified and treated as operating leases under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  because they meet the four criteria of an operating lease there is no transfer of title  there is not a bargain purchase option  the lease term is substantially shorter than the economic life of the system  and the present value of the capital component payments is less than of the fair value of the water treatment system at the inception of the contract 
in connection with long term contracts  we may receive payments from our customers prior to the system being placed in service 
such payments are recorded as deferred revenues 
in addition  we may receive payments from our customers in excess of that which can be recognized on a straight line basis 
these payments are also recorded as deferred revenues 
all deferred revenues amounts are recognized as revenues in the periods in which services are rendered to the customer 
in each of these arrangements  the contract term is typically five or more years  provided our customers may elect to terminate their contract with us prior to the expiration upon the occurrence of certain circumstances 
in the case of the long term water treatment contracts  they generally contain a purchase option at the end of the agreement 

table of contents cost of revenues our cost of revenues varies based on the type of revenues as follows cost of systems sold 
our cost of revenues for a sold system includes our cost of materials included in such system plus costs associated with deploying the system  warranty costs  payroll and payroll related costs for our manufacturing personnel and other manufacturing overhead costs 
these costs are recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this method takes into account the cost  estimated earnings and revenues to date on systems not yet completed 
cost of contract revenues 
cost of revenues in connection with contract revenues consist of costs associated with the processing of waters  including the cost of salt and other components used in our systems  waste removal on behalf of our customers  maintenance and other service costs of our systems 
cost of revenues in connection with contract revenue that includes capital for systems basin retains ownership under a water treatment contract includes depreciation expense using a year life under the straight line method 
during the latter half of and  improvements to our management controls and accounting systems enabled us to more thoroughly analyze operating results for each service contract and determine that certain  generally older contracts were operating at net cash flow losses 
these contracts have sustained increasing operating costs such as waste disposal and salt purchase costs as the direct result of higher fuel  salt and other third party costs 
however  unlike our more recent contracts  these older contracts did not allow management to renegotiate terms to recover such increased costs 
management determined that these contracts would continue to generate net operating cash flow losses through the end of the contract period 
accordingly  we recorded a reserve for future contract losses in the amount of million in the fourth quarter of this amount represented the losses which we expect to incur during the remaining term of these contracts 
actual losses on the underlying contracts are being charged against the reserve as incurred 
during  additional older legacy contracts became operational and were operated during the busy  higher volume summer months 
based on the new operating history  especially during the third quarter  it became apparent that the original reserve was not adequate 
management reviewed each contract s financial performance and identified the future expected losses for these contracts  resulting in a million increase to the reserve net of third quarter charges against the reserve for future contract losses  which was charged to cost of contract revenues during the third quarter of these reserve amounts are being reversed as actual losses are incurred on the underlying contracts 
the net reserve for future contract losses included on our balance sheet  both short and long term  as of december  was approximately million 
the cost of revenues for a system also varies by the contaminant s that the system is designed to address 
we purchase components and raw materials from third party vendors which are then assembled into our treatment systems in our manufacturing facilities or assembled at our customers site 
we are not dependent on any sole source suppliers and generally have multiple vendors for each of our components and raw materials  all of which are located within the united states 
research and development expense research and development expense consists primarily of research material costs  payroll and payroll related costs for our research and development personnel and outside sponsored research and consulting expenses associated with the design  development and testing of new and existing technologies and systems 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of payroll and payroll related costs for our corporate management  finance  accounting  sales  marketing and administrative personnel  including 
table of contents commissions for our sales and marketing personnel 
also included in selling  general and administrative expense are overhead costs associated with these activities  marketing and promotion expenses  recruiting fees  public company costs  director fees  and audit and legal expenses 
other income other income included in the statements of operations consists primarily of interest income and income from affiliate  partially offset by interest and other expense 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  long lived assets  accrued liabilities  and income taxes 
these estimates are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
predicting future events is inherently an imprecise activity and  as such  requires the use of assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
our revenues are recognized in two different ways 
for groundwater treatment systems that we sell to our customers  revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method by comparing actual costs incurred to total estimated costs to complete each system 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenues and associated costs as work progresses on a system  based on the expected total system revenues and costs 
in general  financial statements based on the percentage of completion method present the economic substance of production type activities more clearly than the use of the completed contract method  and present the relationships between sales  cost of sales and related period costs more accurately 
for all other groundwater treatment systems delivered to our customers under various contractual arrangements  we recognize revenues for a periodic fee we receive over the life of the contract using the straight line method and recognize a processing fee as our systems treat the customer s contaminated water 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
property consists primarily of groundwater treatment systems which we place with customers under various arrangements 
for our groundwater treatment systems placed with our customers under long term contracts  we capitalize materials  labor  overhead and interest 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
we capitalize expenditures for major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment 
we charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense as incurred 
estimated useful lives are generally as follows auto equipment three to five years  furniture and fixtures three to seven years  other equipment three to years  and groundwater treatment systems years 
judgments and estimates made by us related to the expected useful lives of these 
table of contents assets are affected by factors such as changes in operating performance and fluctuations in economic conditions 
if our assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
intangible assets and goodwill 
in conjunction with our september acquisition of mpt  we engaged an independent third party to assess the fair value of the assets acquired in this transaction 
the purchase price was allocated to net tangible and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values  with approximately million allocated to intangible assets with a weighted average useful life of approximately years 
such intangible assets consist of a covenant not to compete in the amount of million three year useful life  trade name in the amount of million two year useful life  service agreements and contracts in the amount of million six year useful life  customer relationships in the amount of million year useful life and patents in the amount of million year useful life 
the excess of the net purchase price over the estimated fair value of assets acquired was approximately million  which was recorded as non tax deductible goodwill 
judgments and estimates made by us related to the expected useful lives of the intangible assets are affected by factors such as changes in operating performance  loss of existing customers or service contracts  failure to obtain final approval for patents  fluctuations in economic conditions and expected future performance 
if our assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets  including goodwill 
inventory 
inventory consists primarily of raw materials and supplies 
inventory items are stated at the lower of cost  on a first in  first out basis  or market 
physical counts of inventory items are conducted periodically to help verify the balance of inventory 
a reserve is maintained for obsolete inventory  if appropriate 
we consider inventory to be obsolete when it is no longer usable as a system component 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation awards in financial statements 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the date of grant  based on the calculated fair value of the stock based award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the award 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided under sfas no 
r 
this method applies to all new awards or awards modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after january  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the periods prior to presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
r resulted in million and million of expense in and  respectively  and we anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
r will result in million of expense in and million of expense thereafter  based upon options outstanding as of december  in addition  the adoption of this standard will result in difficulties comparing our operating results for current and future periods to those of our prior periods  since prior periods through do not reflect stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
r 
deferred charges during the fourth quarters of and  we recorded deferred charges in an amount equal to the excess of the deemed fair value of our common stock over the exercise price of warrants issued during these periods 
during these same two quarters  we also recorded deferred charges in an amount equal to the excess of the deemed fair value of our common stock over the exercise price of stock options issued during these periods 
such deferred charges have been or will be amortized as charges to the appropriate income statement classification over the period of the underlying transaction for which the warrants were issued in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity

contract revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of million  or  as the number of systems placed in service with customers increased in compared to we anticipate that our annual revenues will continue to increase in the future as we sell more systems and enter into more contracts with our customers 
however  the percentage of increase from year to year will likely fluctuate as our base of revenues increases 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased by million  or to million in from million in this increase was partially due to an increase in the cost of systems sold of million  or  to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to significantly higher than anticipated costs on our largest project  as well as lower than normal margins on the sale of existing systems 
operating costs for our contract revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in operating costs was primarily due to higher costs of waste disposal  salt  chemicals and increased field service labor expense  as well as higher depreciation expense  all as a result of having more systems placed in service with customers in compared to during we recorded a

we expect that our cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to both an increase in the number of systems sold and higher costs of salt  waste disposal and increased field service labor expense  as well as higher depreciation expense  as a result of having more systems placed in service in future periods 
gross loss our gross loss increased to million in from million in our gross profit percentage in was negative compared to negative in this increase in gross loss was primarily the result of i an increase of million in our negative margins from contract operations  ii a decrease of million in our gross margins on standard system sales and iii an increase in our negative gross margin on large system sales of million 
as noted above  in both and we recorded a reserve for future contract losses net of million of charges against the reserve for actual contract losses during of million and million  respectively  which severely impacted our operating profit 
in addition to this reserve  the gross loss on our contract operations was million prior to applying any charges against the contract loss reserve  this compared to million gross loss in the prior year 
the increased gross loss was due primarily to the certain legacy contracts booked in prior periods that became operational in that included  among other things  poor pricing and inadequate contract terms 
research and development expense research and development expense was approximately million in both and we incurred research and development costs for outside consultant expense  research material costs and personnel costs 
we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in subsequent periods as we develop additional groundwater treatment systems and expand our research and development personnel  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues as our revenues grow 
we anticipate that our research and development expense will fluctuate significantly from period to period based upon the timing of our internal and sponsored research projects

table of contents compared in addition  we recorded a million reserve for future contract losses as a result of management s evaluations of certain loss contracts see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition financial operations review for a further discussion of this reserve 
we expect that our cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars in future periods due to both an increase in the number of systems sold and higher costs of salt  waste disposal and increased field service labor expense  as well as higher depreciation expense  as a result of having more systems placed in service in future periods 
as a percentage of revenues  we expect that our cost of revenues will vary from year to year  depending upon the percentage of our revenues recognized from systems sold as opposed to revenues recognized from long term contracts 
gross profit loss we recorded a gross loss of million in compared to gross profit of million in our gross profit percentage in was negative compared to a profit in this decrease in gross profit was primarily the result of i a reserve for future contract losses in the amount of million as discussed above  and ii higher than anticipated costs on our largest system sale project 
additionally  the system sales gross loss reflects the low margins on two projects with special requirements for the construction of buildings through the use of subcontractors during excluding this largest system sale project and the two projects involving the construction of buildings large system sales  our standard system sales gross profit percentages were in the normal mid range during our contract operations gross profit was impacted by higher volume related contract operating costs  particularly waste hauling charges and increased field service labor and engineering expense  especially on certain older contracts 
in general  our gross profit percentage is higher on systems we sell than on systems we place with customers under long term contracts 
we expect our gross profit and gross margin to fluctuate based on the portion of our revenues derived from system sales as opposed to long term contracts 
as noted above  we recorded a million reserve for future losses primarily on older contracts which severely impacted our operating profit 
research and development expense research and development expense was approximately million in both and we incurred research and development costs for outside consultant expense  research material costs  and personnel costs 
we expect our research and development expense to increase in absolute dollars in subsequent periods as we develop additional groundwater treatment systems and expand our research and development personnel  but to decrease as a percentage of revenues as our revenues grow 
our research and development expense constituted a higher percentage of our revenues in prior periods when we were selling our first systems 
we anticipate that our research and development expense will fluctuate significantly from period to period based upon the timing of our internal and sponsored research projects

table of contents fair value of warrants and the write off of approximately million in unamortized loan costs in connection with the repayment of amounts outstanding under our bwca loan  and our xacp notes  both of which are more fully discussed below under liquidity and capital resources  resulting in higher interest expense 
these increases in interest expense were partially offset by an increase of approximately million in interest income earned on net proceeds from our initial public offering in mid may we expect that we will have net interest income for liquidity and capital resources from our inception until our initial public offering in may  we financed our growth and operations primarily with proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and common stock  as well as the incurrence of indebtedness under the bwca loan  our subordinated notes payable to the co investment fund  lp  cross atlantic technology fund ii  lp and catalyst basin water  llc the xacp notes  and our million subordinated note to aqua america  inc the aqua note 
in connection with our initial public offering in may  we received net cash proceeds of approximately million  of which million was used to repay the million bwca loan  million in xacp notes and the million aqua note 
our long term future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenues  the expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the success of our strategic relationships in the marketing of our treatment systems  our ability to place our systems under long term contracts and provide service under our long term contracts  our need to make capital expenditures to increase our resin regeneration capacity including through building new or expanding existing facilities and the continuing market acceptance of our systems and services 
we anticipate continued revenue growth 
our revenue growth impacts our liquidity and places increased demands on our capital resources 
for example  as our system sales to customers increase  we require an increased investment in accounts receivable  as system sales accounts receivable may have repayment terms from several months to one year or beyond 
additionally  as our long term contract revenues increase  we will experience much higher capital expenditure requirements 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our anticipated future growth and operations for at least the next months 
we anticipate that we may need additional capital to finance our growth and operations after such month period or to accelerate our expected growth during such month period 
in such an event  we anticipate that we would be able to raise additional capital through a combination of bank credit facilities  issuance of long term debt and private or public equity offerings 
if we were unable to obtain additional capital through one or more of these sources  our investment in groundwater treatment systems and our revenue growth would be delayed  or we would focus our sales and marketing on the sales of systems as opposed to placing such systems under long term contracts 
we also expect to use third party financing with respect to systems placed through long term contracts  resulting in the sale of the systems 
we also expect to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies  products and businesses that could enhance our technical capabilities  complement our current products and services or expand the breadth of our customer base 
these activities would require additional capital resources 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we have invested substantially all of our available cash funds in money market funds placed with reputable institutions for which credit loss is not anticipated

the foregoing increases in net cash used by operating activities were offset in part by i an increase of million in net book value of systems sold  ii a million decrease in accounts receivable arising from more timely collection of accounts receivable from our customers  iii a million increase in accounts payable as a result of increased operating activity and increases in construction in process and iv a million decrease in other assets and liabilities during net cash used by operating activities was million during compared to net cash used in operating activities of million during in addition to our net loss of million  the increase in net cash used by operating activities was due primarily to a million decrease in accounts payable reflecting expedited settlements of obligations to our vendors when compared to the prior year 
in addition  as noted above  our prepaid expenses increased due to much higher insurance premiums incurred for our corporate liability coverage  most notably directors and officers liability insurance 
accounts receivable balances were higher in when compared to  resulting in approximately million use of cash for operating activities 
the increase in accounts receivable was offset by the million contract loss reserve recorded in in general  accounts receivable arising from systems sales to customers are due in accordance with the provisions of the sales contract  which may provide for extended payment terms ranging from several months to one year or more for a significant portion of the contract price 
in contrast  accounts receivable from systems placed under long term contracts with customers are usually due within a much shorter period  generally within one month after the date services have been performed and the customer has been billed 
accordingly  in periods in which our revenues from system sales are higher  our collection of accounts receivable will be much slower due to the nature of the sales contracts  and we will require additional cash to fund these system sales accounts receivable 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to million in cash paid as partial consideration for the acquisition of mpt  net of cash acquired 
in addition  we experienced a million increase in capital expenditures in compared to this increase in capital expenditures was the result of more systems placed with customers under long term contracts during than during since more customers chose to purchase systems from us rather than pay us under long term contracts

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in this decrease was due primarily to million in net proceeds from sales of common stock attributable to our initial public offering and million in net proceeds received from notes payable receipt 
these decreases in net cash provided by financing activities were offset in part by million in net proceeds from exercise of common stock warrants and a decrease of million in repayments of notes payable and capital lease obligations during compared to the prior year 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to million in the increase was due primarily to an increase of million in net proceeds from sales of common stock attributable to our initial public offering in may  offset in part by a million decrease in net proceeds from notes payable and an million increase in principal payments on notes payable and capital leases 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures are primarily for groundwater treatment systems that we build and then contract to customers under long term contracts 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
our future capital expenditures will fluctuate depending on the number of our systems we place with customers under long term contracts 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will continue to increase in future years 
we anticipate the use of cash of approximately million to million for capital expenditures during for increases in our resin regeneration capacity  development of certain pilot plants for treatment technologies and improving or expanding our existing facilities 
in addition  capital expenditures could increase further relative to any increases in the number of treatment systems delivered to customers under long term contract arrangements  though it is our intent to sell these arrangements to a third party financing company  thus reducing the use of cash for that customer system 
outstanding indebtedness at december   we had no outstanding indebtedness 
warrants issued in connection with indebtedness and other transactions in connection with the bwca loan which was repaid in full in may  we issued to the lender warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants are immediately exercisable and expire in november   provided  that the warrant shall no longer be exercisable on the date of a change in control of our company 
on august   we entered into an omnibus amendment to business loan agreement and warrants dated october   april  and february  omnibus amendment with bwca i  llc 
pursuant to the terms of the omnibus amendment  the prepayment penalty associated with the may repayment of the loans previously outstanding and owed to bwca i  llc was reduced from to  and each of the warrants previously issued to bwca i  llc was amended to allow the holder thereof to effect a net or cashless exercise of the warrant 

table of contents the number of shares of common stock that will be issued to bwca i  llc upon cashless exercise will be reduced from the  shares originally issuable under the warrants 
these warrants have an aggregate exercise price of million  which the warrant holder would normally pay in cash to us 
instead  upon exercise the warrant holder will receive a reduced number of shares of our common stock  effectively foregoing shares equal to million in market value at the time of exercise 
subsequent to the omnibus agreement  during the last two quarters of  holders of  warrants exercised such warrants through cashless exercises  and received  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the xacp notes which were repaid in full in may  we issued to the purchasers warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
these warrants are immediately exercisable and expire on the earliest of november  and immediately prior to a change in control of our company 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the holders of the xacp warrants exercised  warrants at an exercise price of per share and  warrants at an exercise price of per share  resulting in the issuance of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in connection with our nationwide strategic relationship with aqua america and issuance of the aqua note which was repaid in full in may  we granted to aqua america a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share and a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
during the fourth quarter of  the holders of the aqua warrants exercised all of their warrants  resulting in the issuance of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds to us of million 
in addition  in connection with the consent granted by bwca i  llc with respect to our issuance of the aqua note  we granted to bwca i  llc a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
pursuant to our december binding commitment letter with shaw  shaw committed to purchase a total of million of our groundwater treatment systems prior to december  we granted to shaw a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share in connection with its purchase of our groundwater treatment systems 
one fifth of the shares subject to this warrant vest upon each million of our groundwater treatment systems paid for by shaw 
as of december   no shares had vested under the shaw warrant 
the warrant may be exercised for five years after the date of grant 
in  we recognized revenues of approximately million from shaw s purchase of our systems  which was offset by approximately million attributable to the warrant that we granted to shaw pursuant to the transaction 
during  we recognized revenues in the amount of of the remaining million pursuant to this commitment which was offset by approximately million attributable to the warrants we granted to shaw 
we have applied the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
r to the warrants issued in connection with these transactions 
accordingly  the total fair value of the warrants issued has been calculated using the black scholes method 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  the fair values of those warrants primarily related to indebtedness have been or will be recorded as a discount to notes payable  with a corresponding increase in common stock 
the fair value of such warrants is being amortized through the end of each respective loan term under the interest method 
off balance sheet arrangements through december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have 
table of contents been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we do not have relationships or transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years after total in thousands principal payments notes payable interest payments fixed rate notes payable capital lease obligations operating lease obligations capital commitments purchase commitments totals represents estimated costs to complete groundwater treatment systems under current contracts with customers there are no minimum purchase arrangements with vendors effect of inflation and seasonality we do not believe that inflation will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe current contracts and pricing policies will allow for these costs to be appropriately passed on to our customers 
we identified certain older contracts where we did not provide for the ability to offset cost increases and have recorded a million reserve in for these future losses 
during  additional older legacy contracts became operational and were operated during the busy  higher volume summer months 
based on the new operating history  especially during the third quarter  it became apparent that the original reserve was not adequate 
management reviewed each contract s financial performance and identified the future expected losses for these contracts  resulting in a million increase to the reserve for future contract losses  which was charged to cost of contract revenues during the third quarter of the net reserve for future contract losses included on our balance sheet  both short and long term  as of december  was approximately million 
our business  particularly the revenues we receive from our long term contracts  is moderately seasonal due to the impact of summer and hot weather conditions on the water requirements of our customers 
in the summer and warmer months  our customers have a higher demand for water and must increase the utilization of their groundwater resources resulting in a higher volume of groundwater treated during these periods and thus higher revenues from our long term contracts 
our net sales and net income have historically been lowest in the three month periods ending december and march  when the arid west generally faces cooler weather that reduces the utilization of groundwater sources which in turn reduces the processing fees we receive from our long term contracts 
historically  the impact of seasonality has been mitigated through the impact of the sales of our systems in certain periods 
we also expect sales of our systems to continue to mitigate the impact of seasonality in future periods in the near term

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at december   we had no outstanding indebtedness 
the amount of our outstanding debt at any time may fluctuate and we may from time to time be subject to refinancing risk 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our annual interest expense  our results of operations or financial condition 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales within the united states 
since transactions in foreign currencies are immaterial to us as a whole because we do not currently have any significant foreign customers nor do we enter into contracts with foreign entities except contracts denominated in united states currency  we do not consider it necessary to hedge against currency risk
