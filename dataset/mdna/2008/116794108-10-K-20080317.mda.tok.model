executive overview bruker corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries design  manufacture  market and service proprietary life science and materials research systems based on mass spectrometry core technology platforms  x ray technologies  optical emission spectroscopy oes  and molecular spectroscopy technologies 
we also manufacture and distribute a broad range of field analytical systems for chemical  biological  radiological and nuclear  or cbrn  detection 
our financial results as of december   are reported on the basis of three reportable segments bruker axs  bruker daltonics and bruker optics 
following the recent acquisition of the bruker biospin group management will reevaluate the way the business is managed and the internal reporting structure 
the changes in the internal reporting structure may require us to change our segment reporting in the future 
on february   we completed our of the bruker biospin group 
both the company and the bruker biospin group were majority owned by six affiliated stockholders prior to the acquisition 
as a result  our acquisition of the bruker biospin group is considered a combination of companies under common control  and will be accounted for at historical carrying values 
historical consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  statements of cash flows and notes to the consolidated financial statements in future filings with the securities and exchange commission  beginning with the company s quarterly report on form q for the period ending march   will be restated by combining the historical consolidated financial statements of bruker corporation with those of the bruker biospin group 
in addition  because the transaction is accounted for as an acquisition of businesses under common control all one time transaction costs have been expensed as incurred  rather than being added to goodwill 
during the year ended december   we incurred and expensed acquisition related charges totaling million  which consisted of legal fees  investment banking  accounting fees  compensation earned by the special committee of the company s board of directors and antitrust regulation filing fees 
we expect to incur an additional million of acquisition related charges  consisting primarily of investment banking fees  in the first quarter of with the addition of the bruker biospin group  we enhanced our position as a leading supplier for life science and materials research 
the technologies of the bruker biospin group are particularly complementary to the accurate mass electrospray time of flight mass spectrometers of bruker daltonics and the single crystal diffraction x ray spectrometers of bruker axs which will create revenue synergies and provide opportunities to supply customers with equipment packages that have a broader range of applications and value 
we believe the addition of the bruker biospin group will also enhance our distribution in the americas  europe and asia and our sales and service infrastructure  all of which should provide us with revenue growth opportunities and accelerate our drive to improve our margins  net income and operating cash flows 
on july   we completed our acquisition of bruker optics 
both the company and bruker optics were majority owned by five affiliated stockholders prior to the acquisition 
as a result  our acquisition of bruker optics is considered a business combination of companies under common control 
accordingly  the acquisition of bruker optics  as it relates to the portion under common ownership approximately  has been accounted for at historical carrying values 
the portion not under the common ownership of the five affiliated stockholders approximately has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting fair value on a pro rata basis 
the excess purchase price of the interest not under common control over the fair value of the related net assets acquired has been accounted for as goodwill and intangible assets 
because the acquisition was accounted for as a combination of companies under common control  all one time transaction costs have been expensed as incurred rather than being added to goodwill 
during the year ended december   we incurred and expensed acquisition related charges totaling million  which consisted of investment banking  legal and accounting fees  compensation earned by the special committee of the company s board of directors and a bruker optics officer  and antitrust regulation filing fees 
the historical financial statements within this md a have been presented as if the companies had always been combined 
with the addition of bruker optics  we increased and diversified our market presence  technology base  product line  global distribution and customer support capabilities 
the addition of bruker optics increased our critical mass in many of the markets we serve  created revenue synergies  diversified our customer and revenue base and expanded our product and service offerings  providing us with revenue growth opportunities  as well as opportunities to improve our margins  net income and operating cash flows 
the acquisition of bruker optics also provides us with access to new market segments and applications  particularly in pharmaceutical process analytical technologies and pharma forensics  as well as in food and beverage and feed and agricultural analysis 
in addition to bruker optics  we acquired keymaster technologies  inc in july and quantron gmbh in september keymaster provided us with access to the fast growing handheld portable x ray analysis market 
we believe the technologies keymaster has developed  and the markets it serves  are highly complementary to our core business 
quantron complements our existing stationary x ray fluorescence systems for metal foundries  as well as our handheld x ray fluorescence product line 
the operating results of keymaster and quantron have been included in the results of the bruker axs segment from the date of their acquisitions 
bruker axs engages primarily in the business of manufacturing and distributing advanced instrumentation and automated solutions based on x ray technology and oes spark with the purpose of addressing the needs of our customers in the discovery of new drugs  drug targets and advanced materials  as well as individual qa qc applications 
typical customers of bruker axs products and solutions include biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  semiconductor industries  chemical  cement  metals and petroleum companies  raw material manufacturers  and academic and government research institutions 
bruker daltonics is a leading manufacturer of innovative mass spectrometry based instruments and accessories used by pharmaceutical  biotechnology  proteomics and molecular diagnostic companies  academic institutions  and government agencies in their research that can also be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments 
bruker daltonics also manufactures and distributes a broad range of field analytical systems for cbrn detection 
bruker optics is a leading developer  manufacturer and provider of research  analytical and process analysis instruments and solutions based on infrared and raman molecular spectroscopy technology 
typical customers of bruker optics products and solutions include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  cement and petroleum companies  food  beverage and agricultural industries  and academic and government research institutions 
we maintain major technical and manufacturing centers in europe  north america and japan  we have sales offices located throughout the world and our corporate headquarters are located in billerica  massachusetts 
our business strategy is to capitalize on our proven ability to innovate and generate rapid revenue growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
our revenue growth strategy combined with continued improvements to our gross profit margins and increased leverage on our research and development  sales and marketing and distribution investments and general and administrative expenses are expected to enhance our operating margins and improve our earnings in the future 
for the year ended december   our revenue grew by approximately to million 
of this revenue growth  approximately was organic  was the impact of foreign exchange and the remaining was due to acquisitions 
we continue to focus on improving our profitability and our gross profit margins for product and service revenues improved from in to in  reflecting improvements realized from ongoing gross profit margin improvement programs 
we continue to invest in sales and marketing initiatives and research and development  primarily headcount increases and material purchases  which have increased sales and marketing and research and development costs year over year 
we expect these investments to result in increased revenues in future periods 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  on january  this standard revised the measurement  valuation and recognition of financial accounting and reporting standards for equity based compensation plans contained in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values on the date of the grant 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million and million  net of tax  respectively 
stock based compensation was not material to the overall results of operations or specific line items within the consolidated statements of operations in any of the periods presented 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill  long lived assets  warranty costs and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  industry trends and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss is generally transferred to the customer upon receipt of a signed customer acceptance form for a system that has been shipped  installed  and for which the customer has been trained 
as a result  the timing of customer acceptance or readiness could cause our reported revenues to differ materially from expectations 
when products are sold through an independent distributor  a strategic distribution partner or an unconsolidated affiliated distributor  which assumes responsibility for installation  we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return  however  our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year 
revenue is deferred until cash is received when a significant portion of the fee is due over one year after delivery  installation and acceptance of a system 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for each element based on the fair value of the element  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the fair value for each element provided in multiple element arrangements is typically determined by referencing historical pricing policies when the element is sold separately 
changes in our ability to establish the fair value for each element in multiple element arrangements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
grant revenue is recognized when we complete the services required under the grant 
warranty costs 
we normally provide a one year parts and labor warranty with the purchase of equipment 
the anticipated cost for this one year warranty is accrued upon recognition of the sale and is included as a current liability on the balance sheet 
although our facilities undergo quality assurance and testing procedures throughout the production process  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
although our actual warranty costs have historically been consistent with expectations  to the extent warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty accrual may be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with costs determined by the first in  first out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for one international location 
we maintain an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected un saleable or un refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional write downs may be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we evaluate whether goodwill is impaired annually and when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
fair value is determined using market comparables for similar businesses or forecasts of discounted future cash flows 
we also review other intangible assets and other long lived assets when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of our long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
income taxes 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a reserve has been provided  we reverse the related valuation allowance 
if our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differ from estimates  additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are potentially exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce these risks 
all transactions related to risk management techniques are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies and procedures 
analytical techniques used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk include market valuations and sensitivity analysis 
impact of foreign currencies we generate a substantial portion of its revenues in international markets  principally europe and japan  which subjects its operations to the exposure of exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate movement can be positive or negative in any period 
our costs related to sales in foreign currencies are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
our realized foreign exchange gains losses  net were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as we continue to expand internationally we will continue to evaluate our currency risks and may utilize foreign exchange rate contracts more frequently in order to mitigate our foreign currency exposure 
from time to time  we enter into foreign exchange rate contracts in order to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in currency exchange rates have our cash flows related to purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million 
the contracts involved the purchase of euro currency at fixed us dollar amounts on specified dates and had maturities of less than twelve months 
the notional amounts of the contracts are intended to hedge receivables in us dollars 
however  these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  the instruments are marked to market with the corresponding gains and losses recorded in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   the currency exchange contracts had fair values of less than million 
impact of interest rates we regularly invest excess cash in overnight repurchase agreements and interest bearing investment grade securities that we hold for the duration of the term of the respective instrument and are subject to changes in short term interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal 
our exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is derived primarily from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates is to decrease the volatility that changes in interest rates might have on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective we entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency rate swaps in order to minimize the volatility that changes in interest rates might have on earnings and cash flows 
we have determined that its interest rate swaps are not effective in offsetting the change in interest cash flows being hedged as defined by sfas no 
and  accordingly  the changes in the swap s fair value are recorded in current earnings in interest and other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable rate of interest based on the securities industry and financial markets municipal swap index through december the notional amount of the interest rate swap was million at december   and had a fair value of million 
in  we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap arrangement under which we receive semiannual interest payments in euros based on a variable interest rate equal to the six month euribor rate in exchange for semiannual payments in swiss francs at a fixed rate of through december the notional amount of the swap was million and had a fair value of million 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in pre tax interest expense 
inflation we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our business or operating results during any of the periods presented
