the marine products division s financial results are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
executive level overview was a good year for polaris 
the company s overall goal was to get the company back on track following a disappointing and that was accomplished 
the company gained market share in every product line both domestically and internationally 
the execution of the new operational excellence initiative began to take hold and during the company saw significant improvements in system wide cost  quality  and speed 
inventory levels were lower at both the dealer and the factory level 
despite a very challenging economy  especially for consumer durables  polaris grew sales and earnings per share  propelled by great new product introductions such as the ranger rzr tm and victory vision tm 
polaris had a clear plan for and achieved it 
however  as in any year  though  there were some disappointments in several end markets  especially the core north american atv market  were weaker than the company expected 
the significant decline in financial services income in the second half of was not anticipated at the beginning of and while factory inventory decreased five percent in from levels  it was still higher than deemed desirable by the company 
in the end  however  the positives significantly outweighed the negatives in for the full year ended december   net income from continuing operations was per diluted share  a percent increase from earnings of per diluted share for the year ended december  net income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the prior year 
sales for the full year ended december  totaled billion  an increase of seven percent compared to sales of billion for the full year the company s product lines consist of atvs including side by side vehicles  snowmobiles  motorcycles and their related parts  garments and accessories

atvs is the largest product line representing percent of polaris sales in the increase in total company sales in was due to a seven percent increase in atv sales  a nine percent increase in pg a sales and a percent increase in snowmobile sales in the increase in atvs is attributable to continued strong sales growth in the company s ranger tm side by side vehicles  particularly the ranger rzr tm 
snowmobiles grew percent in due to better snowfall and significantly reduced beginning snowmobile dealer inventory levels in compared to the prior year 
victory motorcycles sales in were flat with as the overall motorcycle market in the united states declined in the company sells its products through a network of  dealers in north america and six subsidiaries and distributors in approximately countries outside of north america 
international sales also grew percent in compared to the company s gross profit in increased nine percent from and the gross margin as a percentage of sales  increased basis points to percent in compared to percent in the increase was primarily due to a favorable product mix change as the company sold more side by side vehicles which typically have higher margins as well as favorable foreign currency fluctuations offset somewhat by increased promotional and warranty costs during income from financial services for decreased four percent to million compared to million in  a result of the company s revolving retail credit provider  hsbc  discontinuing the financing of non polaris products at polaris dealerships during the second half of the company generated a gain of million in resulting from the sale of a majority of its investment in ktm 
during  the company repurchased and retired million shares of its common stock for a total of million 
together with the accelerated share repurchase transaction executed in december  these share repurchases have resulted in a percent reduction in the average diluted shares outstanding for the year ended december  compared to since inception of the share repurchase program in  approximately million shares have been repurchased at an average price of per share 
on january   the board of directors authorized an additional million shares for repurchase 
the additional share repurchase authorization  together with the million shares remaining available for repurchase under the prior authorization  represents approximately percent of the shares of polaris common stock currently outstanding

polaris adopted sfas r accounting for stock based compensation effective the beginning of fiscal year using the modified retrospective method

reported net income for the full year ended december   including each of continuing and discontinued operations  the loss on disposal of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of adopting sfas r was million or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  critical accounting policies the significant accounting policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include the following revenue recognition  sales 
table of contents promotions and incentives  share based employee compensation  dealer holdback programs  product warranties and product liability 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to the dealer or distributor 
historically  product returns  whether in the normal course of business or resulting from repurchases made under the floorplan financing program have not been material 
however  polaris has agreed to repurchase products repossessed by the finance companies up to certain limits 
polaris financial exposure is limited to the difference between the amount paid to the finance companies and the amount received on the resale of the repossessed product 
no material losses have been incurred under these agreements 
polaris has not historically recorded any significant sales return allowances because it has not been required to repurchase a significant number of units 
however  an adverse change in retail sales could cause this situation to change 
sales promotions and incentives polaris generally provides for estimated sales promotion and incentive expenses  which are recognized as a reduction to sales  at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor 
examples of sales promotion and incentive programs include dealer and consumer rebates  volume discounts  retail financing programs and sales associate incentives 
sales promotion and incentive expenses are estimated based on current programs and historical rates for each product line 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  accrued sales promotions and incentives were million and million  respectively  reflecting an increase in the core atv and snowmobile sales promotions and incentives cost environment during actual results may differ from these estimates if market conditions dictate the need to enhance or reduce sales promotion and incentive programs or if the customer usage rate varies from historical trends 
adjustments to sales promotions and incentives accruals are made from time to time as actual usage becomes known in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to generate consumer demand based on market conditions as of the balance sheet date 
historically  sales promotion and incentive expenses have been within the company s expectations and differences have not been material 
share based employee compensation in the first quarter ended march  polaris adopted sfas r which requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees 
polaris adopted sfas r using the modified retrospective method 
in accordance with the modified retrospective method  the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been adjusted to give effect to the adoption of sfas r 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options consistent with the provisions of sfas r 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
the company utilizes historical volatility as it believes this is reflective of market conditions 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical exercise patterns 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history of dividend payouts 
sfas r requires the company to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher or lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase or decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease or increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if forfeiture adjustments are made  they would affect the company s gross margin and operating expenses 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments subsequent to the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of were immaterial 
dealer holdback programs polaris provides dealer incentive programs whereby at the time of shipment polaris withholds an amount from the dealer until ultimate retail sale of the product 
polaris records these amounts as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
payments are generally made to dealers twice each year  in the first quarter and the third quarter  subject to previously established criteria 
polaris recorded accrued liabilities of million and million for dealer holdback programs in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents product warranties polaris provides a limited warranty for atvs for a period of six months and for a period of one year for its snowmobiles and motorcycles 
polaris may provide longer warranties related to certain promotional programs  as well as longer warranties in certain geographical markets as determined by local regulations and market conditions 
polaris standard warranties require the company or its dealers to repair or replace defective products during such warranty periods at no cost to the consumer 
the warranty reserve is established at the time of sale to the dealer or distributor based on management s best estimate using historical rates and trends 
polaris records these amounts as a liability in the consolidated balance sheet until they are ultimately paid 
at december  and  the warranty reserve was million and million  respectively 
adjustments to the warranty reserve are made from time to time based on actual claims experience in order to properly estimate the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated to be due and payable could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
product liability polaris is subject to product liability claims in the normal course of business 
polaris self insures its product liability claims 
the estimated costs resulting from any losses are charged to operating expenses when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably determinable 
the company utilizes historical trends and actuarial analysis tools to assist in determining the appropriate loss reserve levels 
at december  and the company had accruals of million and million  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims related to continuing operations 
these accruals are included in other accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the company had accruals of million and million at december  and  respectively  for the possible payment of pending claims related to discontinued operations 
while management believes the product liability reserves are adequate  adverse determination of material product liability claims made against the company could have a material adverse effect on polaris financial condition

in october household and a subsidiary of polaris entered into a revolving program agreement to provide retail financing to consumers who buy polaris products in the united states 
in august  the wholly owned subsidiary of polaris entered into a multi year contract with hsbc  formerly known as household bank sb  na  under which hsbc is continuing to manage the polaris private label credit card program under the starcard label  which until july included providing retail credit for non polaris products 
the agreement provides for income to be paid to polaris based on a percentage of the volume of revolving retail credit business generated 
the previous agreement provided for equal sharing of all income and losses with respect to the retail credit portfolio  subject to certain limitations 
the contract removed all credit  interest rate and funding risk to polaris and also eliminated the need for polaris to maintain a retail credit cash deposit with hsbc  which was million at august  hsbc ceased financing non polaris products under its arrangement with polaris effective july  resulting in a significant decline in the income from financial services reported by polaris in the second half of during the first quarter of  hsbc informed polaris for the first time that it was suddenly no longer satisfied with its profitability from the contractual arrangement currently in place to provide revolving retail credit financing for polaris products 
hsbc claims this dissatisfaction is due to the deterioration of the general overall revolving retail credit market and the volatility of consumer loan loss rates and delinquency trends in the united states 
hsbc informed polaris that it plans to significantly tighten the underwriting standards that it uses in its revolving retail credit approval process effective march   unless polaris agrees to forgo volume based fee income polaris has the right to receive under the contractual arrangement and or absorb more promotional costs 
this proposed tightening of underwriting standards would reduce the availability of this form of financing to polaris retail customers 
polaris desires to continue to facilitate the availability of revolving retail credit to polaris consumers by third parties without assuming retail credit risk  which in the current credit market environment  will likely result in less favorable economic terms for polaris 
although not obligated to do so under the terms of the agreement with hsbc  and while reserving all of its legal rights  polaris will likely agree to forgo the volume based fee income due to polaris and or absorb increased promotional support costs after march  rather than allow hsbc to significantly tighten the underwriting standards for polaris customers 
to help offset the impact of the hsbc change  polaris will encourage its dealers to increase utilization of the installment retail credit agreement between polaris and ge bank in addition to investigating alternative revolving retail credit arrangements during management currently anticipates the income generated from these retail credit agreements for calendar  reported as a component of income from financial services  to be significantly less than the million recorded for the full year although difficult to predict in the current volatile and uncertain credit market environment  these less favorable terms imposed by hsbc  combined with the decision by hsbc to cease financing of non polaris products effective july   will likely result in income generated from the hsbc and ge bank retail credit agreements for calendar year to be in the range of million to million

table of contents the loss of the financing facility for non polaris products by hsbc in july this negative trend combined with the less favorable terms imposed by hsbc discussed above  will likely result in significantly lower income generated from the hsbc and ge bank retail credit agreements in in polaris invested in austrian motorcycle manufacturer ktm by purchasing a percent interest in that company from a third party for million including transaction costs

during  purchases totaling eight percent of polaris cost of sales were from japanese yen denominated suppliers 
the impact of the japanese yen exchange rate fluctuation on polaris raw material purchase prices and cost of sales in had a positive financial impact when compared to the prior year

a ten percent fluctuation in the currency rates as of december  would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the canadian dollar and japanese yen hedge contracts of approximately million combined 
however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged
