based on the changes in our financial reporting structure  the previously reported financial information for the sulfur and fertilizer segments have been combined into one segment known as the sulfur services segment

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on the historical consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
we prepared these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our results may differ from these estimates 
currently  we believe that our accounting policies do not require us to make estimates using assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain 
however  we have described below the critical accounting policies that we believe could impact our consolidated financial statements most significantly 

table of contents you should also read note  significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
some of the more significant estimates in these financial statements include the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and the determination of the fair value of our reporting units under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  all derivatives and hedging instruments are included on the balance sheet as an asset or liability measured at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting  changes in the fair value can be offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until such time as the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
in early  we adopted a hedging policy that allows us to use hedge accounting for financial transactions that are designated as hedges 
derivative instruments not designated as hedges are being marked to market with all market value adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we had designated a portion of our derivative instruments as qualifying cash flow hedges 
fair value changes for these hedges have been recorded in other comprehensive income as a component of equity 
product exchanges we enter into product exchange agreements with third parties whereby we agree to exchange ngls with third parties 
we record the balance of ngls due to other companies under these agreements at quoted market product prices and the balance of ngls due from other companies at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
revenue recognition revenue for our four operating segments is recognized as follows terminalling and storage revenue is recognized for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee 
for throughput contracts  revenue is recognized based on the volume moved through our terminals at the contracted rate 
when lubricants and drilling fluids are sold by truck  revenue is recognized upon delivering product to the customers as title to the product transfers when the customer physically receives the product 
natural gas services natural gas gathering and processing revenues are recognized when title passes or service is performed 
ngl distribution revenue is recognized when product is delivered by truck to our ngl customers  which occurs when the customer physically receives the product 
when product is sold in storage  or by pipeline  we recognize ngl distribution revenue when the customer receives the product from either the storage facility or pipeline 
marine transportation revenue is recognized for contracted trips upon completion of the particular trip 
for time charters  revenue is recognized based on a per day rate 
sulfur services revenue is recognized when the customer takes title to the product  either at our plant or the customer facility 
equity method investments we use the equity method of accounting for investments in unconsolidated entities where the ability to exercise significant influence over such entities exists 
investments in unconsolidated entities consist of capital contributions and advances plus our share of accumulated earnings as of the entities latest fiscal year ends  less capital withdrawals and distributions 
investments in excess of the underlying net assets of equity method investees  specifically identifiable to property  plant and equipment  are amortized over the useful life of the related assets 
excess investment representing equity method goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment  annually 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  this goodwill is not subject to amortization and is accounted for as a component of the investment 
equity method investments are subject to impairment under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
no portion of the net income from these entities is included in our operating income 

table of contents prior to july   we used the equity method of accounting for our unconsolidated non controlling limited partner interest in cf martin sulphur 
on july   we acquired the remaining interests in cf martin sulphur not previously owned by us 
subsequent to the acquisition  cf martin sulphur is included in the consolidated financial presentation of our sulfur services segment following our acquisition of prism gas in november  we own an unconsolidated interest in waskom  the matagorda  and pipe 
as a result  these assets are accounted for by the equity method and we do not include any portion of their net income in operating income 
on june   we  through prism gas  acquired a ownership interest in a partnership which owns the lease rights to the assets of the bosque county pipeline bcp 
this interest is accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
goodwill goodwill is subject to a fair value based impairment test on an annual basis 
we are required to identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets 
we are required to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we would be required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
we have performed the annual impairment tests as of september   september  and september   respectively 
in performing such tests  we determined we had four reporting units which contained goodwill 
these reporting units were in our four reporting segments terminalling  natural gas services  marine transportation  and sulfur services 
we determined fair value in each reporting unit based on a multiple of current annual cash flows 
we determined such multiple from our recent experience with actual acquisitions and dispositions and valuing potential acquisitions and dispositions 
environmental liabilities we have historically not experienced circumstances requiring us to account for environmental remediation obligations 
if such circumstances arise  we would estimate remediation obligations utilizing a remediation feasibility study and any other related environmental studies that we may elect to perform 
we would record changes to our estimated environmental liability as circumstances change or events occur  such as the issuance of revised orders by governmental bodies or court or other judicial orders and our evaluation of the likelihood and amount of the related eventual liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts in evaluating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we assess a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the length of time the receivable has been past due and historical collection experience 
based on these assessments  we record both specific and general reserves for bad debts to reduce the related receivable to the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers 
asset retirement obligation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  we recognize and measure our asset retirement obligations and the associated asset retirement cost upon acquisition of the related asset 
subsequent measurement and accounting provisions are in accordance with sfas on march   the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin  an interpretation of sfas fin  which was effective for fiscal years ending after december   clarifies that the recognition and measurement provisions of sfas apply to asset retirement obligations in which the timing or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
we have recognized asset retirement obligations  where appropriate 

table of contents reclassifications as previously reported in our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended september   which was filed with the sec on november   we converted to a new accounting system in august in connection with the system conversion  we closely examined expense classifications under the new system 
upon review  it was determined that certain payroll  property insurance and property tax expenses that were previously categorized as selling  general and administrative expenses would be more appropriately classified as operating expenses or costs of products sold 
as a result  those expenses were set up in the new system with the new classification 
accordingly  it is necessary for us to reclassify the related expense items for fiscal years and since the reclassifications  as indicated in the tables set forth below  had no impact on the prior periods revenues  operating income  cash flows from operations or net income  we have determined that the reclassifications are not material to our audited financial statements for the prior periods 
nonetheless  we are effecting the reclassifications for prior periods in order to provide comparative clarity and consistency among the annual periods when compared to our financial reporting for our current fiscal year 
the following tables set forth the effects of the reclassifications on certain line items within our previously reported consolidated statements of income for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands  which statements of income and certain relevant footnotes thereto as well as the relevant portions of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for those periods have been updated

seasonality a substantial portion of our revenues are dependent on sales prices of products  particularly ngls and sulfur based fertilizer products  which fluctuate in part based on winter and spring weather conditions 
the demand for ngls is strongest during the winter heating season 
the demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring planting season 
however  our terminalling and storage and marine transportation businesses and the molten sulfur business are typically not impacted by seasonal fluctuations 
we expect to derive approximately half of our net income from our terminalling and storage  marine transportation  natural gas and sulfur businesses 
therefore  we do not expect that our overall net income will be impacted by seasonality factors 
however  extraordinary weather events  such as hurricanes  have in the 
table of contents past  and could in the future  impact our terminalling and storage and marine transportation businesses 
for example  hurricanes katrina and rita in the third quarter of adversely impacted our operating expenses and the four hurricanes that impacted the gulf of mexico and florida in the third quarter of adversely impacted our terminalling and storage and marine transportation business s revenues 
impact of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations in  and however  inflation remains a factor in the united states economy and could increase our cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment as well as our labor and supply costs 
we cannot assure our unitholders that we will be able to pass along increased costs to our customers 
increasing energy prices could adversely affect our results of operations 
diesel fuel  natural gas  chemicals and other supplies are recorded in operating expenses
