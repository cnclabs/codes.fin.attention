critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for bad debt  derivatives  accounting for income taxes  impairment of long lived assets  share based compensation  and goodwill 
revenue recognition and allowance for bad debts revenues principally consist of monthly recurring fees for colocation  exchange point  managed and professional services fees 
colocation revenues also include monthly rental income for unconditioned space in the nap of the americas 
revenues from colocation  exchange point services  and managed web hosting as well as rental income for unconditioned space  are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
installation fees and related direct costs are deferred and recognized ratably over the expected life of the customer installation which is 
table of contents estimated to be to months 
managed and professional services fees are recognized in the period in which the services are provided 
revenues also include equipment resales which are recognized in the period in which the equipment is delivered and installed 
revenue from contract settlements is generally recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured and no remaining performance obligation exists 
taxes collected from customers and remitted to the government are excluded from revenues 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when more than one element such as equipment  installation and colocation or managed web hosting services are contained in a single arrangement  the company allocates revenue between the elements based on acceptable fair value allocation methodologies  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the fair value of the undelivered elements is determined by the price charged when the element is sold separately  or in cases when the item is not sold separately  by using other acceptable objective evidence 
we apply judgment to ensure appropriate application of eitf  including the determination of fair value for multiple deliverables  determination of whether undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of delivered elements  and timing of revenue recognition  among others 
for those arrangements where the deliverables do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  revenue from all deliverables are treated as one accounting unit and recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the receivable is reasonably assured 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from customers 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
as of march  and  accounts receivable amounted to million and million  respectively 
these amounts are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million and million  respectively 
we sell certain third party service contracts and software assurance or subscription products and evaluates whether the subsequent sales of such services should be recorded as gross revenues or net revenues in accordance with the revenues recognition criteria outlined in sab no 
 eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and fasb technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product contracts 
we determine whether our role is that of a principal in the transaction and therefore assume the risks and rewards of ownership or if our role is acting as an agent or broker 
under gross revenues recognition  the entire selling price is recorded as revenues and costs to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded in cost of revenues 
under net revenues recognition  the cost to the third party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to revenues resulting in net revenues equal to the gross profit on the transaction and there are no cost of revenues 
we analyze current economic news and trends  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating revenue recognition and the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
customer contracts generally require us to meet certain service level commitments 
if we do not meet the required service levels  we may be obligated to provide credits  usually a month of free service 
such credits  to date  have been insignificant 
derivatives we have  in the past  used financial instruments  including interest cap agreements  to manage exposures to movements in interest rates 
the use of these financial instruments is designed to modify our exposure to these risks 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
however  our senior convertible notes  due june   the senior convertible notes  senior convertible notes  due june   the senior convertible notes and senior subordinated convertible notes  due june   the series b notes collectively  the notes contain embedded derivatives that require separate 
table of contents valuation from the notes 
we recognize these derivatives as assets or liabilities in its balance sheet  measures them at their estimated fair value  and recognizes changes in their estimated fair value in earnings in the period of change 
we estimate the fair value of our embedded derivatives using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
these embedded derivatives derive their value primarily based on changes in the price and volatility of our common stock  interest rates and credit rating 
on february   we entered into two interest rate hedge agreements  in accordance with the provisions of the senior secured credit facilities 
one of the interest rate hedge agreements was effective march  for a notional amount of million and a fixed interest rate of 
interest payments on this hedge are due on the last day of each march  june  september and december commencing on june  and ending on december  the second interest rate hedge agreement is effective on july  for a notional amount of million and a fixed interest rate of 
interest payments on this hedge are due on the last day of each january  april  july and october commencing on october  and ending on january  the interest rate swap agreements serve as an economic hedge against increases in interest rates and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
accordingly  we account for these interest rate hedge agreements on a fair value basis and adjusts these instruments to fair value and the resulting changes in fair value are charged to earnings 
considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we may eventually pay to settle these embedded derivatives 
accounting for income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider estimates of future taxable income 
effective april   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
as amended accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb no 
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
fin requires that we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions will more likely than not be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
the provisions of fin also provide guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
in connection with the adoption of fin no 
 we analyzed the filing positions in all of the federal  state and foreign jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits and there was no effect on the financial condition or results of operations for the year ended march  as a result of implementing fin in accordance with fin  we continued our policy of recognizing penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax positions  if any  in general and administrative expenses 
we currently have provided for a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
based on the available objective evidence  management does not believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realizable in the future 
an adjustment to the valuation allowance would benefit net income in the period in which such determination is made if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future 
we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or applicable tax authorities for the following open tax periods the year ended december   the quarter ended march   and the years ended march  
table of contents  march  and net operating loss carryovers incurred in years prior to are subject to audit in the event they are utilized in subsequent years 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  prolonged industry downturns  significant decline in our market value and significant reductions in our projected cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the number of additional customer contracts  profit margins  terminal growth rates and discounted rates 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
as of march  and  our long lived assets  including property and equipment  net and identifiable intangible assets  totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather  are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with its respective carrying amount 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step involves a comparison of the implied fair value to the carrying value of that reporting unit s goodwill 
to the extent that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized 
identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
as of march  and  our goodwill totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
goodwill represents the carrying amount of the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in conjunction with i the acquisition of a corporation holding rights to develop and manage facilities catering to the telecommunications industry ii the acquisition of a managed web hosting service provider in europe iii the acquisition of a managed web hosting services provider in the united states and iv the acquisition of a disaster recovery and business continuity provider in the united states 
we performed the annual test for impairment for the goodwill acquired in  and in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and concluded there were no impairments 
we performed the annual test for impairment for the goodwill acquired in  in the second quarter of the fiscal year and concluded there were no impairments 
share based compensation on april   we adopted the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments by estimating the fair value of options at grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing model and the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
calculating the fair value of option awards requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term  risk free interest rates  expected dividends and stock price volatility 
management bases expected term in accordance with sab and expected volatility on historical volatility trends and our peer group s common stock over the period commensurate with the expected term 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our 
table of contents actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period and could result in subsequent increases or decreases in compensation expense 
see note  share based compensation  in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
on march   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the vesting  effective as of march   of all unvested stock options previously granted under our stock option and executive incentive compensation plans 
the options affected by this accelerated vesting had exercise prices ranging from to 
as a result of the accelerated vesting  options to purchase approximately  shares became immediately exercisable 
all other terms of these options remain unchanged

our senior convertible notes and our series b notes contain embedded derivatives that require separate valuation 
we recognize these embedded derivatives as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet  measure them at their estimated fair value and recognize changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative instruments in earnings 
we estimated that the embedded derivatives associated with our senior convertible notes  classified as liabilities  had a march  estimated fair value of million and a march  estimated fair value of million

for the year ended march   we recognized expense of million due to the change in value of our embedded derivatives 
over the life of the senior convertible notes  given the historical volatility of our common stock  changes in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives are expected to have a material effect on our results of operations 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
furthermore  we have estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives using a theoretical model based on the historical volatility of our common stock of as of march  over the past twelve months 
if a market develops for our senior convertible notes or we are able to find comparable market data  we may be able to use future market data to adjust our historical volatility by other factors such as trading volume 
as a result  the estimated fair value of these embedded derivatives could be significantly different 
any such adjustment would be made prospectively 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  this increase is due to the amortization of the discount on our senior convertible notes 
we record amortization using the effective interest method and accordingly the interest expense associated with the senior convertible notes will increase as the carrying value increases

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at march   our exposure to market risk related primarily to changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio 
our marketable investments consist primarily of short term fixed interest rate securities 
we invest only with high credit quality issuers and we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we do not believe that a significant increase or decrease in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
we have not entered into any financial instruments for trading purposes 
however  the estimated fair value of the derivatives embedded within our senior convertible notes  senior convertible notes  and series b notes create a market risk exposure resulting from changes in the price of our common stock  interest rates and our credit rating 
we do not expect significant changes in the near term in the two year historical volatility of our common stock used to calculate the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives 
we do not expect the change in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative to significantly affect our results of operations and it will not impact our cash flows 
our senior convertible notes  senior convertible notes and our senior secured notes have fixed interest rates and  accordingly  are not exposed to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
however  the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
these interest rate changes may affect the fair market value of the fixed interest rate debt but do not impact our earnings or cash flows 
in addition  the interest on the senior secured credit facilities is determined based on an adjusted eurodollar rate plus basis points  in the case of the first lien agreement  and basis points  in the case of the second lien agreement  or at a rate based on the federal funds rate plus basis points  in the case of the first lien agreement  or basis points  in the case of the second lien agreement  at our election 
on february   we entered into two interest rate hedge agreements  in accordance with the provisions of the senior secured credit facilities 
one of the interest rate hedge agreements was effective march  for a notional amount of million and a fixed interest rate of 
interest payments on this hedge are due on the last day of each march  june  september and december commencing on june  and ending on december  the second interest rate hedge agreement entered into is effective on july  for a notional amount of million and a fixed interest rate of 
interest payments on this hedge are due on the last day of each january  april  july and october commencing on october  and ending on january  the interest rate swap agreements serve as an economic hedge against increases in interest rates and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes 

table of contents our carrying values of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable approximations of their fair value 
for the year ended march   approximately of our recognized revenue has been denominated in us dollars  generated mostly from customers in the us  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations has been minimal 
in the future  a larger portion of our revenues may be derived from operations outside of the us and may be denominated in foreign currency 
as a result  future operating results or cash flows could be impacted due to currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent we engage in international sales that are denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our services less competitive in the international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot conclude that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
some of our operating costs are subject to price fluctuations caused by the volatility of underlying commodity prices 
the commodity most likely to have an impact on our results of operations in the event of significant price change is electricity 
we are closely monitoring the cost of electricity 
to the extent that electricity costs rise  we have the ability to pass these additional power costs onto our customers that utilize this power 
we do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk
