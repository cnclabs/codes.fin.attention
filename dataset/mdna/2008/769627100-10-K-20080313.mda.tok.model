our capital expenditures for riviera las vegas are geared to upgrade the hotel rooms  gaming product and amenities in sufficient condition to compete for customers in the convention market and casino market 
in november  we began a process of upgrading our rooms in las vegas by featuring new euro beds and flat screen tv s 
room rates and slot revenues are the primary factors driving our operating margins 
we use technology to maintain labor costs at a reasonable level  including kiosks for hotel check in  slot ticket redemption and slot club redemptions 
in black hawk  the maximum bet restricts table games to a minimum and the area is basically a locals slot customer market 
our capital expenditures in black hawk are geared to maintain a competitive casino floor compared to the market and to provide upgraded food beverage amenities 
our marketing focus in las vegas is on using direct marketing efforts to customers in our database and providing complimentary rooms to our casino customers based on the level of their play  while reducing the number of rooms available for our tour and travel customers 
we also seek to maximize the number of people who patronize las vegas but who are not guests in our hotel by capitalizing on our prime las vegas strip location  convention center proximity and several popular entertainment productions 
we are well situated on the las vegas strip near circus circus  las vegas hilton  the las vegas convention center  wynn las vegas  the planned estimated billion echelon project on the site of the former stardust and the estimated billion fontainebleau project just to our north  as well as numerous non gaming condominium and time share projects which are either planned or under construction within walking distance of our casino 
however  the recent closures of the stardust  frontier and westward ho as well as construction in our immediate area  has caused a significant reduction in walk in traffic and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
our marketing focus in black hawk is on using direct marketing efforts to customers in our database and providing exciting events and give aways to our loyalty program members 
we completed our formal strategic review process  which we commenced in may when we retained jefferies company  inc as financial advisor to assist us in exploring a range of potential strategic and financial alternatives in order to enhance shareholder value 
in the course of this process  our financial advisor thoroughly explored a sale of the entire company  contacting over thirty five potential bidders over several months  including riv acquisition holdings and its affiliates 
in deciding to terminate the strategic alternative process  we took into account the uncertainty that would be faced by an potential buyer in attempting to complete a potential transaction  the deterioration in the credit markets  the potential costs of terminating the company s swap agreement due to the unpredictable drop in interest rates  the ability to obtain shareholder and regulatory approval of a transaction  the possibility of increased competition from slot machines at colorado racetracks and the impact of weak economic conditions on the company s business 
while the strategic review process did not result in entering into a transaction to sell the entire company at the present time  we have and we will continue to review all opportunities and consider all proposals that it receives  as well as other possible ways in which the company can maximize shareholder value 
we continue to have discussions with the riv acquisition holdings group regarding a possible sale of the company  although no agreements have been entered into related to such a transaction  nor can any assurance be given that an agreement will be ultimately entered into  or if entered into  on what terms or price

ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to operating income  as an indicator of operating performance  as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities  as a measure of liquidity  or as any other measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we have significant uses of cash flows  including capital expenditures  interest payments and debt principal repayments that are not reflected in ebitda

contractual obligations the table under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to adopt accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and provision for income taxes 
we periodically evaluate our policies  and our estimates and assumptions related to these policies 
we operate in a highly regulated industry 
for riviera las vegas and riviera black hawk we are subject to regulations governing operating and internal control procedures 
the majority of our casino revenue is in the form of cash  personal checks or gaming chips  which by their nature do not require complex estimations 
we estimate certain liabilities with payment periods that extend for longer than several months 
such estimates include customer loyalty liabilities  self insured medical and workers compensation costs and litigation costs 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable based upon our past experience with the business and based upon our assumptions related to possible outcomes in the future 
future actual results might differ materially from these estimates 
we have determined that the following accounting policies and related estimates are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because such estimates are highly uncertain or susceptible to change so as to present a significant risk of a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance  and such policies and estimates were selected from among available alternatives  or require the exercise of significant management judgment to apply 
long lived assets we have a significant investment in long lived property and equipment 
we estimate that the non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets exceed the current carrying value of these assets 
any adverse change to the estimate of these non discounted future cash flows could necessitate an impairment charge that would adversely affect our operating results 
we estimate useful lives for our assets based on historical experience  estimates of such classes of assets commercial lives generally  and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
should the actual useful life of a class of assets differ from the estimated useful life  we would record an impairment charge or adjust the period over which this asset is depreciated 
we review useful lives  and obsolescence  and we assess commercial viability of these assets periodically 
deferred tax assets we utilize estimates related to estimated future taxable income in the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
to the realization of deferred tax assets 
our estimates are based upon operating results and  to a lesser extent  our budgets for future operating results 
the valuation allowance has been recorded for our net operating loss carry forwards  excluding our amt credits  which have indefinite lives 
allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
any unforeseen change in customer liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect the collectibility of that account and our operating results 
fair value of interest rate swap liability the fair value of long term liabilities includes the approximate cost to settle our interest rate swap instrument at the respective valuation dates  and is reflected in fair value of interest rate swap liabilities on the balance sheet 
the fair value of the interest rate swap instrument is estimated based upon current and predictions of future interest rate levels along a yield curve  the remaining duration of the instrument and other market conditions and therefore  is subject to significant estimation and a high degree of variability of fluctuation between periods 
litigation cost we assess our exposures to loss contingencies including legal matters  and we provide for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
however  any accruals made in relation thereto do not include the estimated costs of defense for any legal services that we have not yet received 
if the actual loss from a contingency exceeds our estimate  our operating results could be adversely impacted 
self insurance provisions we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation  and  through we were also self insured for non union employee medical insurance coverage 
effective january   we are no longer self insured for non union medical insurance coverage 
we maintain reinsurance coverage for our self insurance claims until those claims are resolved 
insurance claims and provisions include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
in estimating these costs  we consider our historical claims experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
loyalty club program we offer to our guests the opportunity to earn points redeemable for cash and complimentary rooms and food and beverage based on their level of gaming activities while at our properties and an accrual is recorded as points are earned based upon expected redemption rates 
recently issued accounting standards in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no

the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the fair value option established by sfas no 
permits all companies to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
at each subsequent reporting date  a company shall report in earnings any unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected

is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the company also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements see below

would have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating whether to adopt the fair value option under sfas no 
and evaluating what impact such adoption would have on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes

in light of these and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed in this report might not occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in us treasury bills with maturities of days or less 
such investments are generally not affected by changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had million in borrowings 
the borrowings include million credit facility maturing in  sid bonds as defined below  and capital leases maturing at various dates through the equipment lease has fixed interest rate of 
the  in a special improvement district bond offering sid bonds with the city of black hawk represents our share of the debt on the sid bonds of million is payable over a ten year period ending the sid bonds bear interest at 
we are not susceptible to interest rate risk because our outstanding debt is substantially at fixed rates 
we have one interest rate swap arrangement to hedge the underlying interest rate risk on a total of million of borrowings under the term loan  which bears interest at libor plus 
under this interest rate swap arrangement  we receive payments at a variable rate of libor and pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount  which expires on june  as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
as of december   we have one interest rate swap arrangement with periodic step downs beginning in which expires on june  although this interest swap agreement is highly effective economically in fixing the interest rate on this borrowing under the term loan at approximately  changes in fair value of our interest rate swap for each reporting period are  and will continue to be  recorded as an increase decrease in swap fair value as the swap does not qualify for hedge accounting

a hypothetical one percent change in interest rate would not have a material effect on our financial statements  as the interest rate swap we currently have effectively locks our debt at  which is in excess of a one percent increase of the corresponding amount we would receive under the swap agreement 
fin requires us to record future unrealized tax payments however  due to uncertainties surrounding future taxable earnings and future audits related to our income taxes and the potential utilization of our net operating losses  we cannot establish a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of future cash settlements  if any  therefore  we have excluded this amount from the contractual obligations table above
