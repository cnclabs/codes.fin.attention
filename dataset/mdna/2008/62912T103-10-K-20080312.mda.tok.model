item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are an independent energy company focused on generating and developing natural gas prospects in appalachia and other unconventional basins with similar geologic characteristics 
we also control the midstream and field wide gas gathering facilities for our core appalachian properties  providing deliverability directly from the wellhead to interstate pipelines serving major east coast natural gas markets  and we operate natural gas distribution facilities for two communities in kentucky 
historically  we developed most of our prospects through sponsored drilling programs  maintaining combined interests as both general partner and an investor ranging from to  with additional reversionary interests after specified distribution thresholds are reached 
we account for those interests using the proportionate consolidation method  with all material inter company accounts and transactions eliminated on consolidation 
beginning in the second half of  we changed our business model to accelerate organic growth by limiting our use of future drilling programs to participation in our non operated initiatives  retaining all of our available working interest in new wells drilled on operated properties 
results of operations and revenues 
the following table shows the components of our revenues for and  together with their percentages of total revenue in and percentage change on a year over year basis 
year ended december  of revenue revenue change contract drilling oil and gas production gas transmission and compression total 
table of contents our revenue mix for reflects our ongoing strategy for transitioning to a production based business  with oil and gas sales accounting for of total revenues  compared to of total revenues in we expect this trend to continue as we execute our initiatives for long term production growth by expanding our infrastructure  acreage position and working interest in new wells on operated properties  including our horizontal drilling projects planned for contract drilling revenues reflect the size and timing of our drilling program initiatives  as well as our percentage interest in sponsored programs 
although we receive the proceeds from program financings as customer drilling deposits under our drilling contracts with sponsored programs  we recognize revenues from the interests of outside investors in our drilling programs on the completed contract method as the wells are drilled  rather than when funds are received 
the contraction in contract drilling revenues reflects the completion of program initiatives on operated properties and a reduction in our reliance on program financings for other drilling initiatives during the growth in our production revenues in of reflects a increase in production output to  mmcfe  compared to  mmcfe in our average gas sales prices were marginally lower on a year over year basis  amounting to per mcf in we anticipate ongoing production gains as we continue to expand our infrastructure and bring wells on stream in our operated fields 
principal purchasers of our production are gas marketers and customers with transmission facilities near our producing properties 
approximately of our natural gas production in was sold under fixed price contracts  and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices 
gas transmission and compression revenues were driven by fees totaling  for delivering third party gas through our ngas gathering system 
this component of revenues also reflects gathering and compression fees for our drilling program investors share of throughput from our field wide facilities  together with contributions of  from gas utility sales and  from our interest in a limited liability company that owns and operates the gathering system servicing the arkoma cdx field 
expenses 
the following table shows the components of our direct and other expenses in and percentages listed in the table reflect margins for each component of direct expenses and percentages of total revenue for each component of other expenses

these expenses decreased by on a year over year basis but represented of contract drilling revenues in both and the contraction in this part of our business reflects a planned phase out in our use of drilling programs to participate in developing our operated properties in the appalachian basin  and our margins reflect the stabilizing effect of our transition from turnkey to cost plus pricing  which we implemented in to address price volatility for drilling services  equipment and steel casing requirements 

table of contents production expenses in were consistent with our volumetric growth 
in addition to lifting costs  production expenses include field operating and maintenance costs  related overhead  severance and other production taxes  third party transportation fees and lease operating expenses 
our margins in both periods reflect cost savings realized from ownership of the ngas gathering system acquired in march  eliminating transportation fees for our share of leatherwood  straight creek and sme production delivered through the system 
gas transmission and compression expenses in were of associated revenues  compared to in the margins for this part of our business have benefited from third party fees generated by the ngas gathering system 
the improvement in margins for reflect our first full year of owning these midstream assets  which we acquired in march for million 
our gas transmission and compression expenses do not reflect those acquisition costs or capitalized costs of approximately million in for extensions of our field wide gas gathering systems  additions to dehydration and compression capacity or build outs of gas processing and treatment facilities 
we expensed the suspended exploratory well costs during for wells in a well program we began late in to test the shallow new albany shale formation on the eastern rim of the illinois basin in western kentucky 
this resulted in an impairment charge of  in the carrying value of our oil and gas assets during  in addition to a charge of  recognized for the first three wells in that program during selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are comprised primarily of selling and promotional costs for our sponsored drilling programs and overhead costs for supporting our expanded operations as a whole  including additions to our staff and technology infrastructure as well as increased salary and other employee related expenses over the last several years 
non cash charges for options  warrants and deferred compensation reflect the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options 
under this method  employee stock options are valued at the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  and the compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
we also recognized accruals of  in and  in for deferred compensation costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a is recognized under the units of production method  based on the estimated proved developed reserves of the underlying oil and gas properties  and on a straight line basis over the useful life of other property and equipment 
the increase in dd a charges on a year over year basis reflects substantial additions to our oil and gas properties  gas gathering systems and related equipment 
we recognized a bad debt expense of  in the third quarter of to reflect a reserve against past due accounts receivable from oil sales to a regional refinery 
see critical accounting policies and estimates allowance for doubtful accounts 
we also recognized a loss of  from the sale of fixed assets in  compared to gains aggregating  from asset sales in interest expense for increased from higher overall bank borrowings 
draws under our credit facility during were used primarily to support our ongoing drilling initiatives and enhancements of our field wide gas gathering systems 
deferred income tax expense represents future tax liability at the operating company level 
although we have no current tax liability due to the utilization of intangible drilling costs  our consolidated income tax expense is negatively impacted by the non recognition of tax benefits at the parent company level 
net income and eps 
we recognized a net loss of  in  compared to net income of  in  reflecting the foregoing factors 
basic earnings loss per share eps was based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in  compared to eps of based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in

year ended december  of revenue change contract drilling oil and gas production gas transmission and compression total contract drilling revenues reflect both the size and the timing of our drilling program initiatives 
we participated in gross net wells during  primarily through our drilling programs 
for our programs  we implemented a cost plus structure as part of our strategy for reducing exposure to price volatility in drilling services and supplies 
this contributed to more stable margins from our operation of sponsored programs 
our growth in production revenues reflects an increase of in production volumes to  mmcfe in  with a decline in our average sales price of natural gas to per mcf 
our volumetric growth reflects added production from our interests in arkoma cdx wells acquired late in and from wells brought on line during throughout our operating areas  including wells connected in our leatherwood field during the year 
approximately of our natural gas production in was sold under fixed price contracts  and the balance primarily at prices determined monthly under formulas based on prevailing market indices 
gas transmission and compression revenues were driven by fees totaling  for third party deliveries through our ngas gathering system  which we acquired in march this component of revenues also reflects additional gas gathering and compression fees for moving third party leatherwood production through field wide facilities we completed late in  together with contributions of  in from gas utility sales and  from our interest in a limited liability company that owns and operates the gathering system servicing the arkoma cdx field

table of contents contract drilling expenses in were of contract drilling revenues  compared to in the margins for this sector reflect our transition from turnkey to cost plus pricing for sponsored drilling programs  which we implemented in with a view to reducing our exposure to price volatility for drilling services  equipment and steel casing requirements 
production expenses in were driven by our substantial growth in production volumes 
the increase in our production expenses was significantly offset by cost savings realized from ownership of the ngas gathering system acquired in march  eliminating transportation fees during the balance of the year for our share of leatherwood  straight creek and sme production delivered through the system 
as a percentage of oil and gas production revenues  our production expenses increased to in from in the prior year  primarily reflecting lower margins for non operated properties  lower gas sales prices and higher filed service costs

in the fourth quarter of  we expensed part of our capitalized exploratory well costs for a project we began late in to test the shallow new albany shale formation on acquired tracts in western kentucky  with an impairment charge of  in the carrying value of our position 
we also recognized a fourth quarter writedown of  for impairment of non operated properties in polk county  texas 
sg a expenses primarily reflect the timing and extent of our selling and promotional costs for sponsored drilling programs 
on a year over year basis  sg a expenses also reflect higher costs for supporting expanded operations as a whole  including additions to our staff and technology infrastructure as well as increased salary and other employee related expenses 
non cash charges for options  warrants and deferred compensation reflect the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options  which we adopted in under this method  employee stock options are valued at the grant date using the black scholes valuation model  and the compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period 
we also recognized an accrual of  for deferred compensation cost 
the increase in dd a charges reflects substantial additions to our oil and gas properties  gas gathering systems and related equipment  including our acquisition of the ngas gathering transmission system for million in march it also reflects a fourth quarter adjustment of  from an increase in our depletion rate for due to an unanticipated decline natural gas prices at year end  which reduced our proved developed reserves for purposes of determining our depletion rate 
interest expense in increased from the addition of million in convertible debt at the end of and higher overall bank borrowings  used primarily for our acquisition costs of million for cbm assets in the arkoma basin at the end of  million for the purchase of our ngas gathering system early in and capitalized costs of approximately million for extensions and enhancements of our field wide gas gathering systems throughout the year 
we realized a gain of  on the sale of assets in primarily from two strategic transactions 
the first involved a sale of our overriding royalty interests under a farmout for properties we operate in harlan county  kentucky and lee county  virginia 
we had acquired these interests  together with related participation and pipeline capacity rights  for million earlier in the year  and received million for the sale of the royalty interests 
in the second transaction  completed in the fourth quarter  we sold our oil and gas lease position in the williston basin for million  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
we had assembled the position under a leasing program we initiated in at the time of the sale  our williston position aggregated  gross  net areas 
income tax expense in represents future tax liability at the operating company level 
we have no current tax liability due to the utilization of intangible drilling costs allocated from our active drilling programs 

table of contents net income and eps 
we realized net income of  in  compared to  in the prior year  reflecting the foregoing factors 
basic eps was based on  weighted average common shares outstanding in  compared to in based on  weighted average common shares outstanding 
on a fully diluted basis  eps for was on  weighted average common shares 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
net cash of  was provided in operating activities in during the year  we used  in investing activities  most of which reflects net additions to our oil and gas properties and gathering systems 
these investments were funded in part with net cash of  from financing activities 
as a result of these activities  net cash decreased from  at december  to  at the end of net cash of  was provided by operating activities in during the year  we used  in investing activities  primarily for additions to our oil and gas properties and gathering systems  including our million acquisition of ngas gathering system in march these investments were funded in part with net cash of  from financing activities 
net cash decreased from  at december  to  at the end of as of december   we had a working capital deficit of  this reflects wide fluctuations in our current assets and liabilities from the timing of customer deposits and expenditures under drilling contracts with our sponsored programs 
since these fluctuations are normalized over relatively short time periods  we do not consider working capital to be a reliable measure of liquidity 
the working capital deficit at the end of is not expected to have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods 
capital resources 
our business involves significant capital requirements 
the rate of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
without successful development activities  our proved reserves would decline as oil and gas is produced from our proved developed reserves 
our long term performance and profitability is dependent not only on developing existing oil and gas reserves  but also on our ability to find or acquire additional reserves and the infrastructure to support their development on terms that are economically and operationally advantageous 
historically  we have relied on a combination of cash flows from operations  bank borrowings and private placements of our convertible notes and equity securities to fund our ongoing reserve and infrastructure development and acquisition activities  as well as participation in our drilling initiatives by outside investors in our sponsored programs 
with the evolution of our business model during for accelerating organic growth by retaining all of our available working interest in wells drilled on operated properties  we have limited our use of future drilling programs to participation in our non operated initiatives 
this may increase our dependence on the credit and capital markets to meet our ongoing development objectives 
in november  we completed a registered direct placement of million common shares under our existing shelf registration at per share 
net proceeds of approximately million from the offering are being used to fund part of our capital expenditure program 
pending application  the net proceeds were applied to reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
we maintain a secured credit facility with keybank national association  as agent and primary lender 
the facility has a five year maturity for revolving term loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to million  with a borrowing base of million as of december  the facility is secured by liens on our oil and gas properties 
outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest at fluctuating rates ranging from to above quoted libor rates  depending on the amount of borrowing base utilization 
we are also responsible for commitment fees ranging from to of the unused borrowing base 
as of december   our outstanding borrowings under the facility aggregated million  and the interest rate amounted to 
we have an outstanding series of convertible notes due december  in the aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes are convertible into our common shares at a conversion price of  reflecting an antidilution adjustment based on the pricing of our registered direct equity placement in november we will be entitled to redeem the notes at their face amount plus accrued and unpaid interest if the prevailing market price of our common stock exceeds of the note conversion price for specified periods 
in the event of default under the notes or any change of control  the holders may require us to redeem the notes at a default rate equal to 
table of contents of their principal amount or a change of control rate equal to the greater of of their principal amount or the consideration that would be received by the holders for the underlying shares in the change of control transaction 
any notes that are neither redeemed nor converted prior to maturity will be repayable in cash or in common shares  valued for that purpose at of their prevailing market price 
our ability to repay our bank debt and convertible notes will be subject to our future performance and prospects as well as market and general economic conditions 
we will likely be dependent on additional financings to repay our outstanding long term debt at maturity 
our future revenues  profitability and rate of growth will continue to be substantially dependent on the demand and market price for natural gas 
future market prices for natural gas will also have a significant impact on our ability to maintain or increase our borrowing capacity  to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms and to attract drilling program capital for participation in our non operated initiatives 
the market price for natural gas is subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control 
we expect our cash reserves  cash flows from operations and anticipated borrowing base availability under our credit facility to provide adequate working capital to meet our short term capital expenditure objectives 
to fully realize our financial goals for growth in revenues and reserves  we will continue to be dependent on the capital markets or other financing alternatives as well as continued participation by investors in future drilling programs 
forward looking statements some statements made by us in this report are prospective and constitute forward looking statements with in the meaning of private litigation reform act of other than statements of historical fact  all statements that address future activities  outcomes and other matters we plan  expect  budget  intend or estimate and other similar expressions are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
among other things  these include uncertainty about estimates of future natural gas production  increases in the cost of drilling  completion  gas gathering or other costs of developing our reserves  unavailability of drilling rigs and services  uncertainty of production costs and estimates of required capital expenditures  drilling  operational and environmental risks  commodity price fluctuations  regulatory changes and litigation risks  and uncertainties in estimating proved oil and gas reserves  projecting future rates of production and timing of development and remedial expenditures 
if the assumptions we use in making forward looking statements prove incorrect or the risks described in this report occur  our actual results could differ materially from future results expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
financial market risk interest rate risk 
borrowing under our secured credit facility bear interest at fluctuating market based rates 
accordingly  our interest expenses are sensitive to market changes  which exposes us to interest rate risk on current and future borrowing under the facility 
foreign market risk 
we sell our products and services exclusively in the united states and receive payment solely in united states dollars 
as a result  our financial results are unlikely to be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we are parties to leases for office facilities and various types of equipment 
we are also obligated to make payments at specified times and amounts under instruments governing our long term debt and other commercial

excludes an allocation of  from our convertible notes in the principal amount of  based on equity components of their conversion features 
related party transactions because we operate through subsidiaries and affiliated drilling programs  our corporate structure causes various agreements and transactions in the normal course of business to be treated as related party transactions 
our policy to structure any transactions with related parties only on terms that are no less favorable to the company than could be obtained on an arm s length basis from unrelated parties 
significant related party transactions are summarized in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and related disclosure included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including evaluations of any allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of long lived assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these evaluations form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
although actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  management believes that its estimates are reasonable and that actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts when deemed appropriate to reflect losses that could result from failures by customers or other parties to make payments on our trade receivables 
the estimates of this allowance  when maintained  are based on a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the trade accounts receivable  specific information obtained on the financial condition of customers and specific agreements or negotiated amounts with customers 
impairment of long lived assets 
our long lived assets include property and equipment and goodwill 
long lived assets with an indefinite life are reviewed at least annually for impairment  while other long lived assets are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying values of these assets are not recoverable 
during  we recognized an impartment charge of  for exploratory well costs that had been capitalized for less than one year pending our assessment of reserves for the project
