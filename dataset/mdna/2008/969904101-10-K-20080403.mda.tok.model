item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal financial results including the impact from the additional week of net revenues in fiscal  a week year  our net revenues increased to  from  in fiscal  a week year  with positive growth in all brands 
taking into account the generally bleak retail environment in the first half of the year  and the recessionary warnings that followed in the back half of the year  we are pleased with these results  especially when compared to the lower growth rates of the home furnishings industry overall in fiscal we believe the strength of our brands and our multi channel business model drove this increase 
including a net per diluted share negative impact from the application of fin  partially offset by an estimated per diluted share net benefit from the additional week in fiscal  diluted earnings per share decreased by to in fiscal from in fiscal from a cash flow perspective  fiscal was another strong year  generating  in net cash from operating activities despite higher inventories and lower growth rates 
in fiscal  we returned  to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends  and ended the year with a cash balance of  after internally funding all growth and infrastructure initiatives including  in capital expenditures 
in our retail channel  net revenues in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in store leased square footage of including net new stores  the impact of the extra week of net revenues in fiscal  a week year  and comparable store sales growth of 
net revenues generated in the west elm  pottery barn  williams sonoma and williams sonoma home brands were the primary contributors to this year over year revenue increase 
in our direct to customer channel  net revenues in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal this increase was driven by net revenues generated in the pbteen  west elm  pottery barn and williams sonoma brands primarily due to the impact of the extra week of net revenues in fiscal  a week year  an overall increase in catalog and page circulation of and  respectively  and continued strength in our internet business  which continued to be our fastest growing shopping channel  with revenues increasing to  this increase was partially offset by lost revenues in the hold everything brand due to its transition during the second quarter of fiscal in our core brands  net revenues increased over fiscal driven by net revenues generated in the pottery barn  williams sonoma and pottery barn kids brands  primarily due to the benefit of the extra week of net revenues in fiscal  however  we were negatively impacted throughout the year by the general macro economic environment and its impact on the retail industry 
in the pottery barn brand  we had continued growth in e commerce and saw benefits from the pottery barn brand revitalization strategies 
we did  however  have a comparable store sales decrease of  primarily resulting from the significant weakness in the home furnishings sector and an overall weakened macro environment 
in the williams sonoma brand  we delivered one of the best operating margins in our history due to the on going success of our new merchandising  catalog versioning and e commerce strategies 
in the pottery barn kids brand  though net revenues increased overall  we did see a comparable store sales decrease of driven by on going weakness in textiles and the overall effect of the weakening macro environment  which appears to be impacting pottery barn kids more than our other brands due to the brand s significant dependence on broader discretionary categories such as core textiles 
in our emerging brands  including west elm  pbteen and williams sonoma home  net revenues increased over fiscal  with positive growth in all brands 
in west elm  we expanded the reach of the brand and drove incremental sales from our new and existing stores with a total of stores at the end of fiscal  as well as strong growth in e commerce 
in pbteen  we continued to see positive growth in all key merchandising categories with new product innovation and superior execution driving this year over year revenue growth 
in williams sonoma home  we made significant progress on our key initiatives of building brand awareness  
table of contents enhancing operational execution  and improving overall brand profitability driven by strong merchandising  more efficient retail operations and the implementation of an optimized catalog circulation plan 
fiscal operational results in supply chain operations  we in sourced our west coast furniture hub  which mirrors the changes we made on the east coast in and will allow us to improve the furniture delivery experience for our customers  as well as reduce our furniture return rates 
we also added additional vendors to our furniture delivery network  expanded our monogramming and personalization capabilities  and reengineered our returns processing operations in an effort to differentiate our service offerings  improve our customer service  and reduce our operating costs 
in information technology  we continued the rollout of our new retail inventory management system in the pottery barn  west elm  and williams sonoma home brands 
this system will allow us to optimize the flow of inventory and improve our in stock position in our retail stores 
we also implemented new functionality in our direct to customer channel that is allowing us to improve the relevancy of our marketing interaction with our customers and optimize our catalog response rates 
in e commerce  we launched the next generation of our williams sonoma brand website 
our other brands will begin rolling out similar features and functionality in late fiscal as we look forward to  current trends indicate that we will be operating in one of the most challenging macro economic environments we have seen in many years and we believe that it could get progressively worse  particularly if we find ourselves in a protracted recession 
in light of these trends  we are aggressively driving the appropriate changes in our business while maintaining a very flexible outlook 
while we are committed to driving future growth across all channels  we believe sector declines are likely and that our revenue growth in could be in the negative low single digits 
given this belief  we are equally committed to driving down costs and inventory levels to the extent that the actions do not affect service levels to our customers 
to support future growth and to continue to expand the reach of our brands  we expect to add net new retail stores and expand or remodel an additional stores 
we also expect to intensify the marketing behind our fastest growing channel  e commerce 
specifically  in our emerging brands  we will continue to focus on building brand awareness and enhancing customer access to the brands by adding new stores in west elm and one in williams sonoma home 
we will also identify new customers for the brands through retail name capture and third party list rentals  as well as through natural and paid search 
additionally  we will continue the on going rollout of our pottery barn revitalization initiatives 
in our efforts to drive down costs  we will be executing against the following initiatives strategically optimizing catalog circulation  catalog versioning and paid search  with the objective of improving the overall productivity of our advertising costs  implementing new sourcing and logistics initiatives that in early tests are proving to be effective in reducing customer returns  replacements and damages  improving efficiency in our domestic supply chain by expanding our furniture hub in sourcing initiative and reducing corporate overhead 
while we are confident in our ability to execute against each of these cost reduction initiatives  we believe that they will be more than offset by lower earnings associated with a low single digit decrease in net revenues and higher raw material costs 
to drive down inventory levels  we are significantly modifying our receipt plans  maintaining a high level of flexibility in our vendor commitments and aggressively liquidating slow moving inventory through our outlet stores and e commerce websites 
we will also be working to reduce our average weeks on hand in key merchandising categories through better forecasting and demand planning 
while we believe that these initiatives will be challenging in the short term due to the high volatility in sales trends  they are key priorities for us in also in  we expect to continue to return excess capital to our shareholders as reflected by the additional  share repurchase program that was approved by our board of directors in january and the increase in our quarterly cash dividend of to per share  which was approved by our board of directors in march

among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales because inclement weather can alter consumer behavior or require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors have caused our comparable store sales to fluctuate significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis and  as a result  we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future

table of contents in september  we entered into a year agreement to lease  square feet of storage facility space in city of industry  california 
as of february   we were occupying  square feet of this new facility 
during fiscal  we made total rental payments of approximately  plus applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses 
we are party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases  trademarks  intellectual property  financial agreements and various other agreements 
under these contracts  we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
consolidation of memphis based distribution facilities our memphis based distribution facilities include an operating lease entered into in july for a distribution facility in memphis  tennessee 
the lessor is a general partnership partnership comprised of w 
howard lester  our chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer and james a 
mcmahan  a director emeritus  both of whom are significant shareholders 
partnership does not have operations separate from the leasing of this distribution facility and does not have lease agreements with any unrelated third parties 
partnership financed the construction of this distribution facility through the sale of a total of  of industrial development bonds in and annual principal payments and monthly interest payments are required through maturity in december the partnership industrial development bonds are collateralized by the distribution facility and the individual partners guarantee the bond repayments 
as of february    was outstanding under the partnership industrial development bonds 
we made annual rental payments in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal of approximately  plus interest on the bonds calculated at a variable rate determined monthly approximately as of february   applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses 
although the current term of the lease expires in august  we are obligated to renew the operating lease on an annual basis until these bonds are fully repaid 
our other memphis based distribution facility includes an operating lease entered into in august for another distribution facility that is adjoined to the partnership facility in memphis  tennessee 
the lessor is a general partnership partnership comprised of w 
howard lester  james a 
mcmahan and two unrelated parties 
partnership does not have operations separate from the leasing of this distribution facility and does not have lease agreements with any unrelated third parties 
partnership financed the construction of this distribution facility and related addition through the sale of a total of  of industrial development bonds in and quarterly interest and annual principal payments are required through maturity in august the partnership industrial development bonds are collateralized by the distribution facility and require us to maintain certain financial covenants 
as of february    was outstanding under the partnership industrial development bonds 
we made annual rental payments of approximately   and  plus applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
although the current term of the lease expires in august  we are obligated to renew the operating lease on an annual basis until these bonds are fully repaid 
the two partnerships described above qualify as variable interest entities under fin r due to their related party relationship to us and our obligation to renew the leases until the bonds are fully repaid 
accordingly  the two related party variable interest entity partnerships from which we lease our memphis based distribution facilities are consolidated by us 
as of february   our consolidated balance sheet includes  in assets primarily buildings   in debt and  in other long term liabilities 
consolidation of these partnerships does not have an impact on our net income 

table of contents impact of inflation the impact of inflation on our results of operations for the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
we estimate a provision for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory based on inventory aging reports and specific identification 
if actual obsolescence is different from our estimate  we will adjust our provision accordingly 
specific reserves are also recorded in the event the cost of the inventory exceeds the fair market value 
in addition  on a monthly basis  we estimate a reserve for expected shrinkage at the concept and channel level based on historical shrinkage factors and our current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  off site storage locations  and our third party transportation providers 
advertising and prepaid catalog expenses advertising expenses consist of media and production costs related to catalog mailings  e commerce advertising and other direct marketing activities 
all advertising costs are expensed as incurred with the exception of prepaid catalog expenses 
prepaid catalog expenses consist primarily of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
estimated future revenues are based upon various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
any reduction in the estimated lives would result in higher depreciation expense in a given period for the related assets 
we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review for impairment all stores for which current cash flows from operations are either negative or nominal  or the construction costs are significantly in excess of the amount originally expected 
impairment results when the carrying value of the 
table of contents assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term typically to years is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation on operating expenses and the overall economics of the retail industry for up to years in the future  and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the net carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital or other reasonable estimates of fair market value 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding property and equipment 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability claims 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
we determine our workers compensation liability and general liability claims reserves based on an actuarial analysis 
reserves for self insurance liabilities of  and  as of february  and january   respectively  are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
customer deposits customer deposits are primarily comprised of unredeemed gift certificates  gift cards and merchandise credits and deferred revenue related to undelivered merchandise 
we maintain a liability for unredeemed gift certificates  gift cards and merchandise credits until the earlier of redemption  escheatment or four years 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed an analysis of our historical gift certificate and gift card redemption patterns based on our historical redemption data 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the likelihood of our gift certificates and gift cards being redeemed beyond four years from the date of issuance is remote 
as a result  we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and gift cards to four years from our prior estimate of seven years in fiscal as of february  and january   customer deposits were  and  respectively 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are received by our customers 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customers 
discounts provided to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are delivered to the customer 
revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
sales return reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns  net of cost of goods sold  based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
if actual returns  net of cost of goods sold  are different than those projected by management  the estimated sales return reserve will be adjusted accordingly 
as of february  and january   our reserve for sales returns was  and  respectively 

table of contents stock based compensation we measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method 
for stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights option awards  fair value is determined using the black scholes valuation model  while restricted stock units are valued using the closing price of our stock on the date prior to the date of issuance 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised or cancelled 
the fair value of the award is amortized over the expected service period 
total stock based compensation expense was   and  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and is recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january   which clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions 
fin prescribes a process for the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and requires us to make estimates of the likelihood that certain tax positions will be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is reasonably possible that current income tax examinations involving uncertain tax positions could be resolved within the next months through administrative adjudicative procedures or settlement 
new accounting pronouncements as of january   we adopted emerging issues task force eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the scope of eitf includes sales  use  value added and some excise taxes that are assessed by a governmental authority on specific revenue producing transactions between a seller and customer 
eitf requires disclosure of the method of accounting for the applicable assessed taxes and the amount of assessed taxes that are included in revenues if they are accounted for under the gross method 
we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
only applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards  except for measurements of share based payments  and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  for financial assets and liabilities 
in november  the fasb provided a one year deferral for the implementation of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities reported or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
this statement will require additional disclosures in our financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
will permit entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and report unrealized gains and losses on items 
table of contents for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items  including expensing acquisition related costs as incurred  valuing non controlling interests minority interests at fair value at the acquisition date  and expensing restructuring costs associated with an acquired business 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the first fiscal period beginning on or after december   except for adjustments to a previously acquired entity s deferred tax assets and uncertain tax position balances occurring outside the measurement period  which are recorded as a component of income tax expense in the period of adjustment  rather than goodwill 
early adoption is not permitted 
generally  the effect of sfas r will depend on future acquisitions and  as such  we do not currently expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  including the devaluation of the us dollar and the effects of rising prices in the foreign countries in which we do business 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of february   we have three debt instruments with variable interest rates which subject us to risks associated with changes in interest rates the interest payable on our credit facility  mississippi industrial development bond and bond related debt associated with our memphis based distribution facilities 
as of february   the total outstanding principle balance on these instruments was  with an interest rate of approximately as of february  
if interest rates on these existing variable rate debt instruments rose basis points an approximate increase in the associated variable rates as of february   our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of february   our investments  made solely in money market funds  are stated at cost and approximate their fair values 
an increase in interest rates of would have an immaterial effect on the value of these investments 
declines in interest rates would  however  decrease the income derived from these investments 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
any currency risks related to these international purchase transactions were not significant to us during fiscal and fiscal however  since we pay for the majority of our international purchases in us dollars  a decline in the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies would subject us to risks associated with increased purchasing costs from our vendors in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation 
we can not predict with certainty the effect these increased costs may have on our financial statements or results of operations 
in addition  as of february   we have retail stores in canada and limited operations in both europe and asia  each of which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
although these exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to us in the past  we may enter into foreign currency contracts in the future to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with the intercompany assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we did not enter into any foreign currency contracts during fiscal or fiscal
