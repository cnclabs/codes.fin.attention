item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations backlog  for an explanation of the current year backlog compared with the prior year backlog 
streamline health enters into master agreements with its customers to specify the scope of the system to be installed and or services to be provided by streamline health  the agreed upon aggregate price and the timetable for implementation 
the master agreement typically provides that streamline health will deliver the system in phases  thereby allowing the customer flexibility in the timing of its receipt of systems and to make adjustments that may arise based upon changes in technology or changes in customer needs 
the master agreement also allows the customer to request additional components as the installation progresses  which additions are then separately negotiated as to price and terms 
historically  customers have ultimately purchased systems and services in addition to those originally contemplated by the master agreement  although there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in the future 
at january   streamline health has master agreements and purchase orders from remarketing partners for systems and related services excluding support and maintenance  and transaction based revenues for the application hosting services that have not been delivered  and or installed which  if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  the related products and services are expected to be delivered over the next two to three years 
furthermore  streamline health has entered into application hosting agreements  which are expected to generate revenues in excess of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years through streamline health s master agreements also generally provide for a limited initial maintenance period and require the customer to subscribe for maintenance and support services on a monthly  quarterly  or annual basis 
maintenance and support revenues for fiscal years   and were approximately   and  respectively 
maintenance and support revenues are expected to increase in the future 
at january   streamline health had maintenance agreements and purchase orders from remarketing partners for maintenance  which if fully performed  will generate future revenues of approximately  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal year and the commencement of revenue recognition varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the customer and usage by customers of the application hosting services 
therefore  streamline health is unable to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
streamline health s master agreements generally provide that the customer may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by streamline health  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of streamline health to 
table of contents procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on streamline health s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
royalties and license fees streamline health incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate streamline health s proprietary software 
streamline health licenses these software products  and pays the required royalties and or license fees when such software is delivered to streamline health s customers 
employees as of january   streamline health had full time employees  an increase of during the fiscal year 
in addition  streamline health utilizes independent contractors to supplement its staff  as needed

item a risk factors see also  part i  item  business 
the following is a list of risk factors that affect the company 
they are not listed in any particular order or relative importance and no inferences should be given to the listing order 
the variability of quarterly operating results can be significant 
the company s future revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside the control of the company 
these factors include the relatively large size of customer agreements  unpredictability in the number and timing of system sales  length of the sales cycle  delays in installations and changes in customer s financial condition or budgets 
the company needs to manage its costs while planning for growth 
the company is currently experiencing a period of growth and expansion which has placed  and could continue to place  a significant strain on the company s services and support operations  sales and administrative personnel and other resources 
streamline health believes that it must expand the workforce to develop new products enhance existing products and serve the needs of its existing and anticipated customer base 
the company s ability to successfully expand its operations will depend  in large part  upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees 
the company s ability to manage its planned growth effectively also will require the company to continue to improve its operational  management  and financial systems and controls  to train  motivate  and manage its employees and to increase its operating expenses in anticipation that such growth will increase future revenues 
the company could be less profitable than expected 
because of the relatively fixed operating expenses and overhead  the future profitability of the company is dependent on increasing revenues which may not materialize as anticipated 

table of contents sales have been concentrated in a small number of customers 
the company s revenues have been concentrated in a relatively small number of large customers  and the company has historically derived a substantial percentage of its total revenues from a few customers 
there can be no assurance that a customer will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay installations 
a termination or installation delay of one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of streamline health to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on streamline health s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s major reseller could choose to discontinue reselling streamline health products  and significant customers could elect to discontinue using our products 
the company needs to ensure that it expands the distribution channels to reduce the reliance on a single major reseller and expand the customer base to ensure that the loss of a customer is not a significant loss in total revenues 
streamline health faces significant competition  including from companies with significantly greater resources 
the company currently competes with many other companies for the licensing of similar software products and related services 
many of these companies are larger than streamline health and have significantly more resources to invest in their business 
streamline health s intellectual property rights are valuable  and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of streamline health s products and services 
the company trademarks and copyrights its intellectual property  which represents an important asset to the company 
streamline health does not have any patent protection on any of its software 
the company relies upon license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc 
to maintain the confidentiality of streamline health s proprietary information and trade secrets 
if the company fails to adequately protect the intellectual property through trademarks and copyrights  license agreements  employment agreements  confidentiality  nondisclosure agreements  etc  the intellectual property rights may be misappropriated by others  invalidated  or challenged  and our competitors could duplicate the company s technology or may otherwise limit any competitive technology advantage the company may have 
also  the company could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of software patents and copyrighted and trademarked materials are produced as our software functionality is expanded 
any claim  even if not meritorious  would be expensive to defend  and if the company were to become liable for infringing third party intellectual property rights  the company could be liable for substantial damage awards  and potentially be required to cease using the technology  produce noninfringing technology or obtain a license to use such technology 
due to the rapid pace of technology change  the company believes its future success is likely to depend upon continued innovation  technical expertise  marketing skills and customer support and services rather than on legal protection of our property rights 
however  the company has in the past  and intends in the future  to aggressively assert its intellectual property rights when necessary 
rapid technology changes and short product life cycles could harm streamline health s business 
the technology underlying streamline health s product is subject to rapid change including the potential introduction of new products and technologies  which may have a material  adverse impact on its business  operating results  and financial condition 
the company needs to maintain an ongoing research and development program to continue to develop new products and apply new technologies to the existing products 
the impact of new or changes in existing federal  state  and local regulations governing healthcare information healthcare regulations issued to date have not had a material adverse affect on business 
however  the company cannot predict the potential impact of new or revised regulations that have not yet been released or made final  or any other regulations that might be adopted 
congress may adopt legislation that may change  override  conflict with  or preempt the currently issued regulations 
additionally  legislation governing the dissemination of patient health information is also from time to time proposed and debated at the state level 
these laws or 
table of contents regulations  when adopted  could restrict the ability of customers to obtain  use  or disseminate patient health information 
streamline health believes that the features and architecture of streamline health s products are such that it currently supports or should be able to make the necessary modifications to its products  if required  to ensure support of the hipaa regulations  and other legislation or regulations 
the loss of key personnel could adversely affect streamline health s business 
streamline health s success depends  to a significant degree  on its management  sales force and technical personnel 
the company must recruit  motivate  and retain highly skilled managers  sales  consulting and technical personnel  including application programmers  database specialists  consultants  and system architects who have the requisite expertise in the technical environments in which our products operate 
competition for such technical expertise is intense 
streamline health software may not be error free and could result in claims of breach of contract and liabilities 
streamline health software products are very complex and may not be error free  especially when first released 
although the company performs extensive testing  failure of any product to operate in accordance with its specifications and documentation could constitute a breach of the license agreement and require streamline health to correct the deficiency 
if such deficiency is not corrected within the agreed upon contractual limitations on liability and cannot be corrected in a timely manner  it could constitute a material breach of a contract allowing the termination thereof and possibly subjecting the company to liability 
streamline health s license agreement generally limits the company s liability arising from such claims but such limits may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions or under some circumstances 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the application hosting services and support services could experience interruptions 
the company provides hosting services for certain clients  including the storage of critical patient and administrative data 
in addition  it provides support services to clients through the client support facility 
the company has redundancies  such as backup generators and redundant telecommunications lines  built into its operations to prevent disruptions 
however  complete failure of all generators or impairment of all telecommunications lines or severe casualty damage to the building or equipment inside the buildings housing our data center or client support facilities could cause a disruption in operations and adversely affect clients who depend on the application hosting services 
any interruption in operations at its data center or client support facility could cause the company to lose existing clients  impede our ability to obtain new clients  result in revenue loss  cause potential liability to our clients  and increase our operating costs 
third party products are essential to streamline health s software 
streamline health software incorporates software licensed from various vendors into its proprietary software 
in addition  third party  stand alone software is required to operate some of the company s proprietary software modules 
the loss of the ability to use these third party products  or ability to obtain substitute third party software at comparable prices  could have a material adverse affect on the ability to license streamline health software 
the company could be liable to customers or third parties 
the company s systems provide access to patient information used by physicians and other medical personnel in providing medical care 
the medical care provided by physicians and other medical personnel are subject to numerous medical malpractice and other claims 
the company attempts to limit any potential liability of the company to customers by limiting the warranties on its systems in the company s agreements with healthcare provider 
however  such agreements do not protect the company from third party claims by patients who may seek damages from any or all persons or entities connected to the process of delivering patient care 
the company maintains insurance  which provide limited protection from such claims  if they are successfully litigated 
although no such claims have been brought against the company to date regarding injuries related to the use of our software 
table of contents solutions  such claims may be made in the future 
a significant uninsured or under insured judgment against the company could have a material adverse impact on the company 
the company needs to continuously anticipate future events  such as changes in regulations that could affect its products  and the probability of natural disasters  catastrophes  war  or terrorism etc 
the company may not correctly anticipate such future events which could have a material adverse impact on the company 
access to capital streamline health may need additional capital in the form of loans or equity in order to operate 
the company may be limited to the availability of such capital or may not have any availability 
in addition  risks and uncertainties not currently known to the company or that the company currently deems to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect the company  its financial condition and or operating results

application of critical accounting policies see also notes to consolidated financial statements streamline health s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires streamline health to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  streamline health evaluates its estimates  including those related to product revenues  bad debts  capitalized software development costs  income taxes  warranty obligations  support contracts  contingencies and litigation 
streamline health bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that streamline health believes are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and revenue recognition 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
streamline health believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition streamline health records revenues for customer contracts  including special payment agreements and royalties from third party resellers in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  sab revenue recognition and eitf issue no

generally  revenues from software license fees and hardware sales to end users are recognized when a master agreement is signed and products are made available to end users 
revenues from agreements that contain multiple element arrangements are allocated to the various elements based on the fair value of the elements 
revenues related to routine installation and integration and project management are deferred until the work is performed 
revenues from consulting  education  and application hosting services are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues from short term support and maintenance agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
billings to customers recorded prior to the recognition of revenue are classified as deferred revenues 
revenues recognized prior to progress billings to customers are recorded as contract receivables

royalties are remitted to streamline health based upon ge sublicensing streamline health s software to its customers 
thirty percent of the royalty is due days following the end of the month in which ge executes an end user license agreement with its customer 
the remaining seventy percent of the royalty is due  in varying amounts based on specific milestones  days following the end of the month in which a milestone occurs 
each contract is reviewed quarterly with the appropriate streamline health client manager to determine the appropriateness of the revenue recognition criteria applied to the individual contracts based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the contract  the customer comments  if any  and the status of any open or unresolved issues with the customer 

table of contents bad debts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed streamline health for licensed software  professional services  including maintenance services and application hosting activities 
contracts with individual customers and resellers determine when receivables are due and payable

corrective action  if necessary  is taken by streamline health to resolve open issues related to unpaid receivables 
during these quarterly reviews  streamline health determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its customers or resellers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of streamline health s customers or resellers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
streamline health s customers typically have been well established hospitals  medical facilities  or major healthcare information systems companies that resell streamline health s products  which have good credit histories  and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare facilities have experienced significant operating losses and limited cash resources as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
extended payment of streamline health receivables is not uncommon 
capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the costs of software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development  including coding and testing activities necessary to establish technological feasibility are classified as product research and development and are expensed as incurred

 accounting for income taxes  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes  by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted fin as of february   as required 
as a result of the implementation of fin  the changes to the company s reserve for uncertain tax positions was accounted for as a  adjustment to increase the beginning balance of retained earnings on the company s balance sheet 
the company believes that its income tax positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate adjustments that will result in a material change to its financial position during the next twelve months 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain tax positions have been recorded pursuant to fin as of january  the company and its subsidiary are subject to us federal income tax as well as income taxes in multiple state and local jurisdictions

a valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to a level which will  more likely than not  be realized 
whether the deferred tax assets will be realized depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax asset become deductible 
the net deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amount which will  more likely than not  reduce future taxable income 
as of january   streamline health believes that a valuation allowance is required to reduce a portion of the deferred tax assets  primarily relating to certain net operating loss carry forwards  for the following reasons although streamline health generated approximately  of earnings before income taxes during the three year period ended january   there can be no assurance that streamline health will be able to achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis or be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods and believes historical operating results may not be indicative of the future performance of streamline health in the near or long term 
streamline health has incurred net losses as indicated by the carry forwards of approximately  based on the expenses associated with current and planned staffing levels  continued profitability and utilization of carry forwards to be evaluated as more likely than not is dependent upon increasing revenues 
as of january   streamline health estimates that a valuation allowance of approximately  was required to reduce the deferred tax assets  primarily relating to loss carry forwards  to a level streamline health currently believes will be utilized to offset future earnings before income taxes based on the current backlog and forecasts over the next two years 
the valuation allowance is required due to the inability to predict on a longer term basis that streamline health will more likely than not attain levels of profitability required to utilize additional carry forwards

we believe that the client s ability to develop substitute software that would have the same robust functionality as streamline health s current asp offering will be a major software development undertaking 
therefore  we are unable to determine if or when this client will discontinue the use of our asp services

streamline health relies on ge medical systems for a significant amount of its revenues  the loss of which would have a material adverse affect on future results of operations 
streamline health believes a greater percentage of its future revenues will come from remarketing agreements with  ge medical systems  and other his related vendors such as the emergis  inc agreement that was entered into in december streamline health continues to actively pursue remarketing agreements with other companies 
streamline health believes the large his vendors  hospitals and integrated healthcare delivery networks now have a better understanding of the valuable role the document management and workflow technologies play in providing truly computerized information and the benefits of such systems in utilizing advanced workflow solutions 
as more healthcare providers become aware of and better understand the significant economic and operating benefits of utilizing document management and workflow applications  streamline health believes the future demand for its products and services will increase 
many companies have emerged to provide healthcare applications through private intranets or secure applications on the internet 
additionally  the traditional his companies have developed clinical information systems for the internet 
streamline health s applications are well suited for integration with such clinical systems and are optimized for use on the internet and private intranets 
through streamline health s aspen services  
table of contents application hosting customers can rapidly deploy and access healthcare information using web browser based technology from a central data center on a per transaction or subscription basis thereby minimizing up front capital expenditures 
streamline health believes healthcare organizations will continue to increase their use of healthcare applications through the internet  and streamline health s products are an integral part of providing a complete emr across the internet 
streamline health continues to actively pursue strategic relationships with other healthcare application service providers 
management believes that revenue growth can be fueled by the expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts  an increase in incremental revenue from existing and new strategic distribution partners  an increase in interest by healthcare organizations in streamline health products and services to assist in compliance with the federal hipaa standards as they relate to the confidentiality and security of medical records  and incremental new revenues derived from new lines of business for streamline health in the remote coding  revenue cycle and other workflows for the hospital marketplace 
the revenue cycle workflows are a logical extension of the product line because of the ability of the financial services departments of hospitals to access and process patient information from the emr 
due to an acute shortage of available coding personnel  there currently exists a great demand for solutions to attract and retain qualified coders and to make the coding process more efficient 
since commencing operations in  streamline health has incurred substantial cumulative operating losses 
although streamline health achieved operating profitability during six of the last seven years  streamline health incurred net losses in most fiscal years prior to fiscal year and in the current fiscal year 
based upon the expenses associated with current and planned staffing levels  profitability is dependent upon increasing revenues 
although the company believes that it can return to profitability  there can be no assurance that streamline health will be able to achieve consistent profitability on a quarterly or annual basis nor be able to sustain or increase its revenue growth in future periods and believes historical operating results may not be indicative of the future performance of streamline health in the near or long term 
liquidity and capital resources during the last five fiscal years  streamline health has funded its operations  working capital needs  and capital expenditures primarily from a combination of cash generated by operations  and a  bank loan in streamline health s liquidity is dependent upon numerous factors including i the timing and amount of revenues and collection of contractual amounts from customers  ii amounts invested in research and development  capital expenditures  and iii the level of operating expenses  all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
streamline health s customers typically have been well established hospitals or medical facilities or major his companies that resell streamline health products  which have good credit histories and payments have been received within normal time frames for the industry 
however  some healthcare organizations have experienced significant operating losses as a result of limits on third party reimbursements from insurance companies and governmental entities 
agreements with customers often involve significant amounts and contract terms typically require customers to make progress payments 
streamline health has no significant obligations for capital resources  other the noncancelable operating leases of approximately  payable over the next three years

if it does not appear likely that revenues will increase  it may be necessary to reduce operating expenses or raise cash through additional borrowings  the sale of assets  or other equity financing 
certain of these actions will require current lender approval 
however  there can be no assurance streamline health will be successful in any of these efforts 
if it is necessary to significantly reduce operating expenses  this could have an adverse effect on future operating performance 
streamline health believes that its present cash position  combined with cash generation currently anticipated from operations and the availability of the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
however  continued expansion of the company will require additional resources 
the company may need to incur debt  obtain an additional infusion of capital  or a combination of both  depending on the extent of the expansion of the company and future revenues and expenses 
however  there can be no assurance streamline health will be able to do so 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on streamline health s revenues or expenses
