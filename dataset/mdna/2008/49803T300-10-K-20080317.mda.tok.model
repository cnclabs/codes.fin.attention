item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying historical financial statements and related notes thereto and the risk factors appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in this discussion  unless the context suggests otherwise  references to the company  we  us and our mean kite realty group trust and its subsidiaries 
overview our business and properties kite realty group trust  through its majority owned subsidiary  kite realty group  lp  is engaged in the ownership  operation  management  leasing  acquisition  construction  expansion and development of neighborhood and community shopping centers and certain commercial real estate properties in selected growth markets in the united states 
we also provide real estate facility management  construction  development and other advisory services to third parties 
we derive revenues primarily from rents and reimbursement payments received from tenants under existing leases at each of our properties 
we also derive revenues from providing management  leasing  real estate development  construction and real estate advisory services through our taxable reit subsidiary 
our operating results therefore depend materially on the ability of our tenants to make required payments and overall real estate market conditions 
as of december   we owned interests in a portfolio of operating retail properties totaling approximately million square feet of gross leasable area including non owned anchor space and also owned interests in four operating commercial properties totaling approximately  square feet of net rentable area and an associated parking garage 
also  as of december   we had an interest in properties in our development redevelopment pipeline including our glendale town center and shops at eagle creek properties  both of which are undergoing a major redevelopment 
upon completion  our development redevelopment properties are anticipated to have approximately million square of total gross leasable area 
in addition to our current development redevelopment pipeline  we have a significant visible shadow development pipeline which includes land parcels that are undergoing pre development activity and are in the final stages of preparation for construction to commence 
as of december   this visible shadow pipeline consisted of six projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet of total gross leasable area upon completion 
finally  as of december   we also owned interests in other land parcels comprising approximately acres 
these land parcels are classified as land held for development in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
developments and current market conditions during and into  there was  and continues to be  increasing economic uncertainty 
the united states economy  as well as the specific markets that we operate in  could face a challenging economic environment in the possibility of recession or the effects of inflation  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  energy costs  tax rates  business layoffs  downsizing or industry slowdowns could have an adverse affect on the businesses of our retail tenants 
this  in turn  could challenge our business because current or prospective tenants may be unwilling to enter into or renew leases with us on favorable terms or at all  or our tenants may have a more difficult time paying us rent 
these conditions could also negatively affect the market for retail space 
as an owner and developer of community and neighborhood shopping centers  our performance is linked to economic conditions in the retail industry in those markets where our centers are located 
this is particularly true in indiana  florida and texas  the states where the majority of our properties are located 
the challenging economic conditions in the united states have been created  in part  by recent events in the credit  mortgage and housing markets 
during  higher interest rates  falling real estate prices and a significant increase in the number of high risk  or sub prime  mortgages contributed to dramatic increases in mortgage delinquencies and defaults in the anticipated future delinquencies among sub prime borrowers in the united states is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
these conditions have caused banks to tighten credit standards  making it more difficult for individuals and companies to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all 
obtaining favorable financing is important to our business due to  among other things  the capital needs of our existing development projects 
in addition  we may seek to refinance the current indebtedness on our properties 
the uncertainty in the credit markets could make it more challenging for us to carry out our financing objectives in current dual growth strategy despite the current challenging environment  we believe that our strong balance sheet will continue to provide us access to reliable capital and allow us to refinance variable rate debt 
for example  in january and february  we were able to take advantage of low interest rates and refinance variable rate debt at seven of our consolidated properties and one of our unconsolidated properties 
as a result of this refinancing  approximately of debt obligations previously due in are now due in including our share of debt at our unconsolidated property and approximately of debt obligations previously due in are now due in we will continue to try to take advantage of low interest rates to refinance variable rate debt 
we also believe that  notwithstanding the challenging conditions  our strong demographics  experience with prior downturns in the economy and solid current development and visible shadow pipeline will allow us to continue to execute our dual growth strategy in the first part of this growth strategy is to focus on increasing our internal growth by leveraging our existing tenant relationships to improve the performance of our existing operating property portfolio 
we intend to focus on improving the operational efficiencies of our existing portfolio by attempting to  among other things  lowering our variable costs while increasing ancillary income at our existing properties 
the second part of our growth strategy is to focus on achieving external growth through the expansion of our portfolio 
we continue to develop our current development pipeline and prepare the properties in our visible shadow pipeline for the commencement of construction 
in addition  we continue to pursue targeted acquisitions of both land and neighborhood and community shopping centers in attractive markets with strong economic and demographic characteristics  as well as additional joint venture capital partners 
we expect to incur additional debt in connection with any future development or acquisitions of real estate 
we may also dispose of certain real estate that no longer fits our portfolio or growth strategy 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
purchase accounting the purchase price of operating properties is allocated to tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 

in making estimates of fair values for the purpose of allocating purchase price  a number of sources are utilized 
we also consider information about each property obtained as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired 
a portion of the purchase price is allocated to tangible and intangible assets  including the fair value of the building on an as if vacant basis and to land determined by real estate tax assessments  independent appraisals  or other relevant data  above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over the remaining non cancelable term of the leases 
the capitalized above market and below market lease values are amortized as a reduction of or addition to rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the lease intangibles would be charged or credited to income  and the value of leases acquired 
we utilize independent sources for our estimates to determine the respective in place lease values 
our estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors we consider in our analysis include an estimate of costs to execute similar leases including tenant improvements  leasing commissions and foregone costs and rent received during the estimated lease up period as if the space was vacant 
the value of in place leases is amortized to expense over the remaining initial terms of the respective leases 
we also consider whether a portion of the purchase price should be allocated to in place leases that have a related customer relationship intangible value 
characteristics we consider in allocating these values include the nature and extent of existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  and expectations of lease renewals  among other factors 
to date  a tenant relationship has not been developed that is considered to have a current intangible value 
capitalization of certain pre development and development costs we incur costs prior to land acquisition and for certain land held for development  including acquisition contract deposits as well as legal  engineering and other external professional fees related to evaluating the feasibility of developing a shopping center 
these pre development costs are included in construction in progress in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
if we determine that the development of a property is no longer probable  any pre development costs previously incurred are immediately expensed 
we also capitalize costs such as construction  interest  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs of personnel directly involved with the development of our properties 
as a portion of the development property becomes operational  we expense appropriate costs on a pro rata basis 
impairment of investment properties in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas no 
 investment properties are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable 
impairment losses for investment properties are recorded when the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the investment properties during the expected hold period are less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
impairment losses are measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset 
in accordance with sfas no 
 operating properties held for sale include only those properties available for immediate sale in their present condition and for which management believes it is probable that a sale of the property will be completed within one year 
operating properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
depreciation and amortization are suspended during the held for sale period 
our properties generally have operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished from the rest of our activities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the operations reported in discontinued operations include those operating properties that were sold or were considered held for sale and for which operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished 
the operations from these properties are eliminated from ongoing operations  and we will not have a continuing involvement after disposition 
prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the operations of these properties as discontinued operations 
revenue recognition as lessor  we retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases 
base minimum rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that grant additional rents based on tenants sales volume contingent percentage rent 
percentage rents are recognized when tenants achieve the specified targets as defined in their lease agreements 
percentage rents are included in other property related revenue in the accompanying statements of operations 
reimbursements from tenants for real estate taxes and other recoverable operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expense is incurred 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized in accordance with statement of financial standards sfas no 
 accounting for sale of real estate 
in summary  gains from sales are not recognized unless a sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and we do not have a substantial continuing financial involvement in the property 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
project costs include all direct labor  subcontract  and material costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance costs incurred to date 
project costs do not include uninstalled materials 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income  which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
development and other advisory services fees are recognized as revenues in the period in which the services are rendered 
performance based incentive fees are recorded when the fees are earned 
results of operations acquisition and development activities the comparability of results of operations is significantly affected by our development and acquisition activities and the effects of the ipo and related formation transactions

liquidity and capital resources current state of capital markets the uncertainty in the credit markets have caused banks to tighten credit standards  making it more difficult for individuals and companies to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all 
obtaining favorable financing is important to our business due to the capital needs of our existing development projects 
in light of the uncertainty in the credit markets and the economy in general  we intend to aggressively manage our balance sheet in and  to the extent available to us  take advantage of low interest rates to refinance variable rate debt and minimize our interest rate risk 
for example  in january and february  we were able to refinance variable rate debt at seven of our consolidated properties and one of our unconsolidated properties 
as a result of this refinancing  approximately of debt obligations previously due in are now due in including our share of debt at our unconsolidated property and approximately of debt obligations previously due in are now due in we may also seek to reduce the aggregate amount of indebtedness outstanding under our unsecured credit facility  discussed below  and diversify our capital structure

subject to certain conditions  including the prior consent of the lenders  we have the option to increase our borrowings under the unsecured facility to a maximum of million 
the unsecured facility also includes a short term borrowing line of million with a variable interest rate 
borrowings under the short term line may not be outstanding for more than five days 
the amount that we may borrow under the unsecured facility is based on the value of properties in the unencumbered property pool 
we currently have unencumbered assets  of which are wholly owned and used to calculate the amount available for borrowing under the unsecured credit facility and two of which are joint venture assets 
the major unencumbered assets include silver glen crossings  glendale town center  king s lake square  hamilton crossing  waterford lakes  eastgate pavilion  wal mart plaza  market street village  and courthouse shadows 
as of december   the total amount available for borrowing under the unsecured facility was approximately million 
our ability to borrow under the unsecured facility is subject to ongoing compliance with various restrictive covenants similar to those in our previous secured credit facility  including with respect to liens  indebtedness  investments  dividends  mergers and asset sales 
in addition  the unsecured facility  like our previous secured credit facility  requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio of or in certain circumstances  adjusted ebitda as defined in the unsecured facility to fixed charges coverage ratio of at least to  minimum tangible net worth defined as total asset value less total indebtedness of million plus of the net proceeds of any future equity issuances  ratio of net operating income of unencumbered property to debt service under the unsecured facility of at least to  minimum unencumbered property pool occupancy rate of  ratio of floating rate indebtedness to total asset value of no more than to  and ratio of recourse indebtedness to total asset value of no more than to we were in compliance with all applicable covenants under the unsecured facility as of december  under the terms of the unsecured facility  we are permitted to make distributions to our shareholders of up to of our funds from operations provided that no event of default exists 
if an event of default exists  we may only make distributions sufficient to maintain our reit status 
however  we may not make any distributions if an event of default resulting from nonpayment or bankruptcy exists  or if our obligations under the credit facility are accelerated 
short and long term liquidity needs we derive the majority of our revenue from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
therefore  our ability to generate cash from operations is dependent on the rents that we are able to charge and collect from our tenants 
while we believe that the nature of the properties in which we typically invest primarily neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a relatively stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  general economic downturns or downturns in the markets in which we own properties may still adversely affect the ability of our tenants to meet their lease obligations  as discussed in more detail above in overview developments and current market conditions 
in that event  our cash flow from operations could be materially affected 
the nature of our business  coupled with the requirements for qualifying for reit status which includes the stipulation that we distribute to shareholders at least of our annual reit taxable income and to avoid paying tax on our income  necessitate that we distribute a substantial majority of our income on an annual basis which will cause us to have substantial liquidity needs over both the short term and the long term 
our short term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses associated with our operating properties  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on our debt  expected dividend payments including distributions to persons who hold units in our operating partnership and recurring capital expenditures 
when we lease space to new tenants  or renew leases for existing tenants  we also incur expenditures for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions 
this amount  as well as the amount of recurring capital expenditures that we incur  will vary from year to year 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of costs for recurring capital expenditures on operating properties 
we also incurred approximately million of costs for tenant improvements and external leasing commissions  of which approximately million related to costs associated with a new tenant at our thirty south property 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  borrowings under the unsecured facility and new construction loans 
our long term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for development of new properties  redevelopment of existing properties  non recurring capital expenditures  acquisitions of properties  and payment of indebtedness at maturity 
as of december   our glendale town center and shops at eagle creek properties were undergoing major redevelopment activities 
we anticipate our investment in the redevelopment at glendale town center  net of third party contributions  will be approximately million 
we anticipate our investment in the redevelopment at shops at eagle creek will be approximately million 
we expect to fund these investments through draws on our unsecured facility 
as of december   we had nine development projects in our current development pipeline 
the total estimated cost  including our share and our joint venture partners share  for these projects is approximately million  of which approximately million had been incurred as of december  our share of the total estimated cost is approximately million  of which we have incurred approximately million as of december  we expect to fund these investments through a combination of new construction loans and draws on our unsecured facility 
in addition to our current development pipeline  we have a significant visible shadow development pipeline which includes land parcels that are in the final stages of preparation for construction to commence 
as of december   this visible shadow pipeline consisted of six projects that are expected to contain approximately million square feet at a total estimated project cost of approximately million  of which our share is currently expected to be approximately million 
we expect to fund these investments through a combination of new construction loans and draws on our unsecured facility 
we are actively pursuing the acquisition and development of other properties  which will require additional capital 
we do not expect to have sufficient funds on hand to meet these long term cash requirements 
we will have to satisfy these needs through participation in joint venture transactions  additional borrowings  sales of common or preferred shares and or cash generated through property dispositions 
we believe we will have access to these sources of capital on favorable terms to fund our long term liquidity requirements  but we cannot assure this will be the case 
our ability to access the capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors  including general capital market conditions 
in september  the company entered into an agreement the venture with prudential real estate investors prei to pursue joint venture opportunities for the development and selected acquisition of community shopping centers in the united states 
the venture intends to develop or acquire up to billion of well positioned community shopping centers in strategic markets in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  the company has agreed to present to prei opportunities to develop or acquire community shopping centers  each with estimated project costs in excess of million 
the company has the option to present to prei additional opportunities with estimated project costs under million 
it is expected that equity capital contributions of up to million will be made to the venture for qualifying projects 
the company expects contributions would be made on a project by project basis with prei contributing and the company contributing of the equity required 
our first project with prei is parkside town commons  which is currently in our visible shadow development pipeline 
in august  we filed a registration statement  and subsequent prospectus supplements related thereto  with the securities and exchange commission allowing us to offer  from time to time  common shares or preferred shares for an aggregate initial public offering price of up to million 
in october  we issued million common shares under this registration statement for gross offering proceeds of approximately million 
in may  we issued  common shares under this registration statement for offering proceeds  net of offering costs  of approximately million 
we have approximately million remaining under this registration statement

for a discussion of the impact of inflation on the company 
cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase resulted largely from the addition of four operating properties purchased in  the opening of several properties that were under development during  and the change in tenant receivables and deferred costs and other assets between years of million 
these increases were partially offset by a change in accounts payable  accrued expenses  deferred revenues  and other liabilities between years of approximately million 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily a result of a decrease of million in property acquisition and capital expenditures in compared to in addition  during  we realized net proceeds of million from the termination of our lease with marsh supermarkets at naperville marketplace and the related sale of this asset 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  a decrease of million from proceeds from loan transactions  net of loan transaction costs  decreased approximately million between periods 
this decrease was largely due to new debt obtained during for the purchase of four operating properties  an outside partners interest in a consolidated property  the financing of the acquisition of development land parcels  and the funding of development activity 
in  a significant portion of proceeds from loan transactions was related to the draw of million from the new unsecured credit facility to repay the principal amount outstanding under our then existing secured revolving credit facility and retire the secured revolving credit facility 
loan payments also decreased million between years  which was primarily the result of the repayment of short term borrowings related to the acquisition of properties in comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the increase resulted largely from the addition of nine fully operational or partially operational properties and was partially offset by cash used through changes in deferred costs and other assets of million 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million in  an increase of million from the increase largely resulted from a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of operating properties of million between years

cash provided by financing activities totaled million during  an increase of million from loan proceeds net of transaction costs and principal payments increased million between years and loan payments increased million between years 
net loan proceeds were primarily used to finance acquisition and development activity 
in addition  during  we had a follow on offering of common shares  raising million after offering costs 
primarily as a result of the shares issued in connection with the follow on offering  our distributions to shareholders increased million 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do  however  have certain obligations to some of our unconsolidated joint venture arrangements  including our joint venture with prudential real estate investors with respect to our parkside town commons development 
as of december   we owned a interest in this joint venture which  under the terms of this joint venture  will be reduced to upon the commencement of construction 
as of december   our share of unconsolidated joint venture indebtedness was million 
unconsolidated joint venture debt is the liability of the joint venture and is typically secured by the assets of the joint venture 
as of december   the operating partnership had guaranteed unconsolidated joint venture debt of million in the event the joint venture partnership defaults under the terms of the underlying arrangement 
mortgages which are guaranteed by the operating partnership are secured by the property of the joint venture and that property could be sold in order to satisfy the outstanding obligation 
see note investments in unconsolidated joint ventures in our notes to consolidated financial statements  contained in this form k  for information on our unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended december   and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties  excluding interest

as a result  million of these obligations previously due in are now due in construction contracts in the table represent commitments related to new developments  redevelopments and third party construction

we intend to satisfy the approximately million of contractual obligations that are due in as reduced by million due to the variable debt refinancings primarily with cash generated from operations  draws on our revolving line of credit  obtaining new financing  and  where appropriate  refinancing of indebtedness coming due 
in connection with our formation at the time of our ipo  we entered into an agreement that restricts our ability  prior to december   to dispose of six of our properties in taxable transactions and limits the amount of gain we can trigger with respect to certain other properties without incurring reimbursement obligations owed to certain limited partners 
we have agreed that if we dispose of any interest in six specified properties in a taxable transaction before december   then we will indemnify the contributors of those properties for their tax liabilities attributable to their built in gain that exists with respect to such property interest as of the time of our ipo and tax liabilities incurred as a result of the reimbursement payment 
the six properties to which our tax indemnity obligations relate represented approximately of our annualized base rent in the aggregate as of december  these six properties are international speedway square  shops at eagle creek  whitehall pike  ridge plaza shopping center  thirty south  and market street village

we calculate ffo in accordance with the best practices described in the april national policy bulletin of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which we refer to as the white paper 
the white paper defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciated property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
given the nature of our business as a real estate owner and operator  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance  such as gains or losses from sales of depreciated property and depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance  is not an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  and is not indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
our computation of ffo may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definitions differently than we do 
our calculation of ffo and reconciliation to net income is as follows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  funds from operations net income add loss on sale of asset  net of tax less gain on sale of operating property add limited partners interests in income add depreciation and amortization of consolidated entities and discontinued operations  net of minority interest add joint venture partners interests in depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated entities funds from operations of the kite portfolio less limited partners interests in funds from operations funds from operations allocable to the company funds from operations of the kite portfolio measures of the operating performance of the operating partnership s real estate properties and construction and service subsidiaries in which the company owns an interest 
funds from operations allocable to the company reflects a reduction for the limited partners weighted average diluted interest in the operating partnership 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments depend upon prevailing interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in interest rates of debt instruments of similar maturities and terms 
market risk related to fixed rate debt we had approximately million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness as of december  inclusive of net premiums on acquired debt of million 
during  we participated in the following interest rate swaps on february   a portion of the unsecured facility was hedged by an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of and matures february   on august   two of our outstanding interest rate swaps totaling million matured 
these swaps were entered into during to hedge variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt and had a fixed interest rate of and  on august   in connection with these maturities  an additional portion of the unsecured facility was hedged by an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  a fixed rate of and matures february   on august   a portion of our variable rate construction loan at naperville marketplace was hedged by an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of and matures december   on august   a portion of the venture s variable rate construction loan at parkside town commons was hedged by an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of and matures march   on december   a portion of our variable rate construction loan at beacon hill shopping center was hedged by an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of and matures march   on december   a portion of our variable rate construction loan at estero town commons was hedged by an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of and matures january   and on december   a portion of our variable rate construction loan at tarpon springs plaza was hedged by an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of and matures january  in total  at december   we had million of consolidated interest rate swaps outstanding 
including the effects of these swaps  our fixed and variable rate debt would have been approximately million and million  respectively  of our total consolidated indebtedness at december  reflecting our share of unconsolidated debt  our fixed and variable rate debt was and  respectively  of total consolidated and our share of unconsolidated indebtedness at december  based on the amount of our fixed rate debt  a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in its fair value of approximately million 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt of approximately million 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  would increase or decrease our annual cash flow by approximately million 
as a matter of policy  we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative transactions 
inflation most of our leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation by requiring the tenant to pay its share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance 
this helps reduce our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation
