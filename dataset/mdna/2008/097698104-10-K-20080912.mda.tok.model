overview sales of the company s products are generally related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration and development activity  which is dependent  primarily  on oil and gas prices 
the recent high price of oil  increased worldwide energy demand and the depletion of proven oil and natural gas reserves have contributed to an increased demand for marine seismic surveys 
as a result  the demand for the company s products is strong 
the company s sales increased in the fiscal year ended june  compared to the year ended june   aided by the acquisition  effective july   of real time systems inc  a developer  manufacturer and seller of air gun controllers synchronizers rts 
the company believes that the oilfield services industry will continue to be strong during fiscal because of the continued imbalance between supply and demand for hydrocarbons  low reserve replacement rates and high commodity prices 
the company also anticipates continued use of more sophisticated technology  such as d and wide azimuth seismic exploration surveys 
in particular  wide azimuth surveys create a need for a larger seismic vessel fleet because such surveys require utilization of several vessels working in tandem 
effective may   the company sold substantially all of the assets of its wholly owned subsidiary  custom products corporation custom 
custom  a developer  manufacturer and seller of miniature industrial clutches and brakes and seller of sub fractional horsepower electrical motors  formerly comprised the company s industrial products segment 
custom was the only unit in the industrial products segment 
therefore  due to the sale of custom  the company operates only in the oilfield services equipment business 
in the consolidated financial statements  amounts relating to custom have been reported as discontinued operations in fiscal year and prior fiscal year information relating to custom has been restated as discontinued operations

these anticipated capital expenditures will relate primarily to new and replacement production machinery and leasehold improvements relating to a new leased manufacturing facility in fredericksburg  texas refer to contractual obligations below for additional information regarding this facility 
since a relatively small number of customers account for the majority of the company s sales  the consolidated accounts receivable balance at the end of any period tends to be concentrated in a small number of customers

capital expenditures to be incurred by the company in fiscal relating to this facility are estimated to be  results of operations year ended june  compared to year ended june  consolidated sales for the year ended june  totaled  an increase of  or from fiscal year primarily due to higher volume of sales of complete energy source systems  air gun replacement parts  underwater electrical connectors and cables  and effective july   sales of air gun controllers synchronizers  data loggers and auxiliary equipment 
higher sales reflected continued strength in marine seismic activity and the acquired rts business  which contributed sales of  consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the year ended june   unchanged from the year ended june  the gross profit in fiscal was positively impacted by higher gross profit associated with the acquired rts business  partially offset by lower gross profit associated with certain foreign sales  which included sales of auxiliary equipment purchased from outside vendors that normally have a lower margin than the company s proprietary products

higher sales reflected continued strength in marine seismic activity 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of consolidated sales was for the year ended june  versus for the year ended june  the gross profit improvement was due to higher manufacturing efficiencies associated with the increase in sales and higher pricing  partially offset by higher material and labor costs 
in addition  the gross profit for the year ended june  was adversely affected by sales of auxiliary equipment purchased from third party suppliers 
third party auxiliary equipment had significantly lower margin than the company s proprietary products 
research and development costs for the year ended june  decreased by  or from the year ended june  these expenditures were associated with work being done to improve the company s apg guns and ssms 
the decrease was primarily due to lower spending for ssms 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended june  from the year ended june  due primarily to higher professional fees  compensation expense  and freight out 
higher professional fees were primarily due to the incremental expenses incurred to become compliant with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the increase in compensation expense primarily reflected higher incentive compensation  the addition of personnel and salary increases 
higher freight out reflects the increase in consolidated sales

the above mentioned factors resulted in net income for the year ended june  of  compared to net income of  for the year ended june  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying the accounting policies most critical to its financial statements have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and requires the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  the company s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  recording of inventory reserves  deferred taxes  and the potential impairment of goodwill 
these policies are discussed below 
the company also has other key accounting policies  including the establishment of bad debt reserves 
the company believes that these other policies either do not generally require it to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or are less likely to have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
although the company believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the end of each reporting period and involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ significantly from the company s estimates and its estimates could be different using different assumptions or conditions 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales revenue when it is realized and earned 
the company s reported sales revenue is based on meeting the following criteria manufacturing products based on customer specifications  delivering product to the customer before the close of the reporting period  whereby delivery results in the transfer of ownership risk to the customer  establishing a set sales price with the customer  collecting the sales revenue from the customer is reasonably assured  and no contingencies exist 
inventory reserves a significant source of the company s revenue arises from the sale of replacement parts required by customers who have previously purchased products 
as a result  the company maintains a large quantity of parts on hand that may not be sold or used in final assemblies for an extended period of time 
in order to recognize that certain inventory may become obsolete or that the company may have supplies in excess of reasonably supportable sales forecasts  an inventory valuation reserve has been established 
the inventory valuation reserve is a significant estimate made by management 
actual results may differ from this estimate  and the difference could be material 
management establishes the inventory valuation reserve by reviewing the inventory for items that should be reserved in full based on a lack of usage for a specified period of time and for which future demand is not forecasted and establishes an additional reserve for slow moving inventory based on varying percentages of the cost of the items 
the reserve for inventory valuation at june  and was  and  respectively 
at june  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the raw materials and sub assemblies inventory were considered slow moving and subject to a reserve provision equal to all or a portion of the cost  less an estimate for scrap value 
in certain instances  this inventory has been unsold for more than five years from date of manufacture or purchase  and in other instances the company has more than a five year supply of inventory on hand based on recent sales volume 
at june   the cost of inventory for which the company has more than a five year supply on hand and the cost of inventory for which the company has had no sales during the last five years amounted to approximately  management believes that this inventory is properly valued and appropriately reserved 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  that would not result in a cash outlay since the cash required to manufacture or purchase the older inventory was expended in prior years 
the inventory valuation reserve is adjusted at the close of each accounting period  as necessary  based on management s estimate of the valuation reserve required 
this estimate is calculated on a consistent basis as determined by the company s inventory valuation policy 
increases to the inventory valuation reserve result in a charge to cost of sales  and decreases to the reserve result in a credit to cost of sales 
the inventory valuation reserve is also decreased when items are scrapped or disposed of 
during the fiscal year ended june   the inventory valuation reserve was decreased by  and the company did not scrap or dispose of any items 
deferred taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
the company reviews its internal forecasted sales and pre tax earnings estimates to make its assessment about the utilization of deferred tax assets 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
if that assessment changes  a charge or a benefit would be recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the company has concluded that no deferred tax valuation allowance was necessary at june  and june  because future taxable income is believed to be sufficient to utilize any deferred tax asset 
goodwill impairment testing as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
management tested goodwill for impairment as of july  and and the tests indicated no impairment of the goodwill balances at june  and goodwill represents approximately of the company s total assets at june  and is thus a significant estimate by management 
even if management s estimate were incorrect  it would not result in a cash outlay because the goodwill amounts arose out of acquisition accounting 
see notes  and to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning goodwill 
recent accounting developments business combinations in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r continues to require the purchase method of accounting for business combinations and the identification and recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas r requires  among other things  the buyer to fair value assets and liabilities acquired as of the acquisition date ie  a fair value model rather than a cost allocation model  expense acquisition related costs  recognize assets or liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at acquisition date using acquisition date fair values  recognize goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest over the acquisition date fair value of net assets acquired  recognize at acquisition any contingent consideration using acquisition date fair values ie  fair value earn outs in the initial accounting for the acquisition  and eliminate the recognition of liabilities for restructuring costs expected to be incurred as a result of the business combination 
sfas r also defines a bargain purchase as a business combination where the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest 
under this circumstance  the buyer is required to recognize such excess formerly referred to as negative goodwill in earnings as a gain 
in addition  if the buyer determines that some or all of its previously booked deferred tax valuation allowance is no longer needed as a result of the business combination  sfas r requires that the reduction or elimination of the valuation allowance be accounted as a reduction of income tax expense 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company will apply sfas r to any acquisitions that are made on or after july  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the company s first fiscal year that begins after november  the company believes that sfas will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require new fair value measurements 
the purpose of sfas is to provide a single definition of fair value and to provide additional guidance relative to fair value measurements 
the end result of sfas application will be consistency and comparability in fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company believes that it is unlikely that sfas will have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements because the company does not deal in transactions requiring complex fair value measurements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk none
