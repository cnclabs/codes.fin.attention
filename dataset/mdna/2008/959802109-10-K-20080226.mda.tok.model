overview we are a leading provider of money transfer services  operating in two business segments consumer to consumer money transfer services  provided primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency  real time money transfer processing systems 
this service is available for both international transactions that is  the transfer of funds from one country to another and intra country transfers that is  money transfers from one location to another in the same country 
consumer to business payment services  which allow consumers to send funds to businesses and other organizations that receive consumer payments  including utilities  auto finance companies  mortgage servicers  financial service providers and government agencies all sometimes referred to as billers through our network of third party agents and various electronic channels 
while we continue to pursue international expansion of our offerings in selected markets  as demonstrated by our december acquisition of servicio electronico de pago sa and related entities sepsa or pago f cil in argentina  the segment s revenue was primarily generated in the united states during all periods presented 
businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as other and represented or less of consolidated revenue during the three years ended december   and  and include western union branded money orders available through a network of third party agents primarily in the united states and canada  and prepaid services 
prepaid services include a western union branded prepaid mastercard card sold through select agents in the united states and the internet  a western union branded prepaid visa card sold on the internet  and top up services for third parties that allow consumers to pay in advance for mobile phone and other services 
also included in other are recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to our company  and consulting costs used to develop ongoing processes in connection with completing the spin off  and expenses incurred in connection with the development of certain new service offerings  including costs to develop mobile money transfer and micro lending services 
the consumer to consumer money transfer service is available through an extensive network of agent locations that offer western union services around the world 
some of our agent locations only pay out and do not send money 
in addition to our agent locations  we are expanding the ability of consumers to send money through other channels  such as our internet site  westernunion 
com  and the telephone 
consumer to consumer money transfer service is available through the western union  orlandi valuta and vigo sm brands 
the consumer to business service allows consumers to transfer money to a biller 
this service is available at many of our western union agent locations  primarily in the united states  and through the internet or by telephone 

table of contents factors that we believe are important to our long term success include international growth by expanding and diversifying our global distribution network  building our brands and enhancing the consumer experience  expanding the channels by which consumers can send or receive money  and diversifying our consumer to consumer and consumer to business service offerings through new technologies and new services 
significant factors affecting our financial position and results of operations include transaction volume is the primary generator of revenue in our businesses 
transaction volume in our consumer to consumer segment is affected by  among other things  the size of the international migrant population and individual needs to transfer funds in emergency situations 
we believe that the demand for money transfer services will be strong as people continue to migrate to other countries for economic and other reasons 
as noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k  a reduction in the size of the migrant population  interruptions in migration patterns or reduced employment opportunities including those resulting from any changes in immigration laws  economic development patterns or political events  could adversely affect our transaction volume 
for discussion on how these factors have impacted us in recent periods  refer to the consumer to consumer segment discussion below 
revenue is also impacted by changes in the fees we charge consumers  the amount of money sent  and by the foreign exchange spreads we set 
we intend to continue to implement strategic pricing reductions  including actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and competitive factors 
decreases in our fees or foreign exchange spreads generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
we continue to face robust competition in both our consumer to consumer and consumer to business segments from a variety of money transfer and consumer payment providers 
we believe the most significant competitive factors in the consumer to consumer segment relate to brand recognition  distribution network  consumer experience and price and in the consumer to business segment relate to brand recognition  convenience  speed  variety of payment methods and price 
regulation of the money transfer industry is increasing 
the number and complexity of regulations around the world and the pace at which regulation is changing are factors that pose significant challenges to our business 
we continue to implement policies and programs and adapt our business practices and strategies to help us comply with current legal requirements  as well as with new and changing legal requirements affecting particular services  or the conduct of our business in general 
our activities include dedicated compliance personnel  training and monitoring programs  government relations and regulatory outreach efforts and support and guidance to the agent network on compliance programs 
these efforts increase our costs of doing business 
our consumer to business segment continues to experience a shift in demand in the united states from cash based walk in payment services to lower margin  higher volume growth electronic payment services 
significant financial and other highlights significant financial and other highlights for the year ended december  include we generated  million in total consolidated revenues and  million in consolidated operating income  resulting in year over year growth of and in total consolidated revenues and operating income  respectively 
our operating income margin was during the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december  operating income and operating income margin were impacted by the shift in business mix reflecting stronger growth in the international business  which carries a lower margin than the united states originated businesses  the million accelerated non cash stock compensation charge taken in connection with the change in control of first data as further described in results of operations  and million of incremental independent public company expenses compared to million in 
table of contents consolidated net income during was million  representing a decrease of from basic and diluted earnings per share during were and  respectively  compared to basic and diluted earnings per share in of and  respectively 
in addition to the factors described above which have negatively impacted operating income during  net income also decreased in due to higher interest expense in connection with higher outstanding borrowings payable to third parties 
we completed million consumer to consumer transactions worldwide  representing an increase of over  due primarily to transactions generated outside of the united states 
we completed million consumer to business transactions  an increase of over excluding transactions attributable to pago f cil  which was acquired in december  consumer to business transactions increased in compared to consolidated cash flow provided by operating activities was  million 
cash provided by operating activities remained consistent during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   despite decreased net income  as some of the decrease to net income was from increased non cash charges which have not impacted cash flows 
the separation of western union from first data on january   the first data corporation first data board of directors announced its intention to pursue the distribution of of its money transfer and consumer payments businesses related assets  through a tax free distribution to first data shareholders 
effective on september   first data completed the separation and the distribution of these businesses the distribution 
prior to the distribution  our company had been a segment of first data 
in connection with the spin off  we reported a billion dividend to first data in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity deficiency net investment in the western union company  consisting of a promissory note from our subsidiary  first financial management corporation  or ffmc  in an aggregate principal amount of billion  the issuance of billion in western union notes and a cash payment to first data of million 
the remaining dividend was comprised of cash  consideration for an ownership interest held by a first data subsidiary in one of our agents which had already been reflected as part of our company  settlement of net intercompany receivables exclusive of certain intercompany notes as described in the following paragraph  and transfers of certain liabilities  net of assets 
we also settled as part of the spin off  certain intercompany notes receivable and payable with first data along with related interest and currency swap agreements associated with these notes 
the net settlement of the principal and related swaps resulted in a net cash inflow to our cash flows from financing activities of million 
the net settlement of interest on these notes receivable and payable of million was reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
basis of presentation the financial statements in this annual report on form k for periods ending on or after the distribution are presented on a consolidated basis and include the accounts of our company and its majority owned subsidiaries 
the financial statements for the periods presented prior to the distribution are presented on a combined basis and represent those entities that were ultimately transferred to our company in connection with the spin off 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our company s segments have been eliminated 
the historical consolidated statements of income include expense allocations for certain corporate functions historically provided to western union by first data  including treasury  tax  accounting and reporting  mergers and acquisitions  risk management  legal  internal audit  procurement  human resources  investor relations and information technology 
if possible  these allocations were made on a specific identification basis 
otherwise  the expenses related to services provided to western union by first data were allocated to western 
table of contents union based on the relative percentages  as compared to first data s other businesses  of headcount or other appropriate methods depending on the nature of each item of cost to be allocated 
pursuant to a transition services agreement we entered into with first data prior to the spin off  first data provided western union with certain of these services at prices agreed upon by first data and western union 
the transition services agreement expired on september  the costs historically allocated to us by first data for the services provided to us were lower than the costs we have incurred and will continue to incur following the spin off 
certain expenses related to being a stand alone company  reflected in the consolidated statements of income  are higher than the historical amounts prior to the spin off 
the financial information presented in this annual report on form k prior to the spin off date of september  does not reflect what our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows would have been as a stand alone company during the periods presented and is not necessarily indicative of our future consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
adoption of fin we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on january  fin addresses the determination of how tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
under fin  we recognize the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the position  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an increase in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits plus associated accrued interest and penalties of million  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings

r  following the modified prospective method effective january  sfas no 
r requires all stock based payments to employees to be recognized in the income statement based on their respective grant date fair market values over the corresponding service periods and also requires an estimation of forfeitures when calculating compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense  including stock compensation expense allocated by first data prior to the spin off on september  and the impact of adopting sfas no 
r  was million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
stock compensation expense during the year ended december  included a million accelerated non cash stock compensation charge taken in connection with the change in control of first data 
in december  first data accelerated vesting of all outstanding unvested stock options granted to its officers and employees under its long term incentive plan 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of these stock options was made primarily to reduce stock based compensation expense that otherwise likely would have been recorded in future periods following first data s adoption of sfas no

table of contents components of revenue and expenses the following briefly describes the components of revenue and expenses as presented in the consolidated statements of income 
descriptions of our revenue recognition policies are included in note summary of significant accounting policies in our consolidated financial statements 
transaction fees transaction fees are charged to consumers for sending money transfers and consumer to business payments 
consumer to consumer transaction fees generally vary according to the principal amount of the money transfer and the locations from and to which the funds are sent 
transaction fees represented of western union s total consolidated revenues for the year ended december   and are most reflective of our performance 
foreign exchange revenue in certain consumer money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies  we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency 
foreign exchange revenue growth has historically been driven principally by growth in international cross currency transactions 
foreign exchange revenue represented approximately of western union s total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  commission and other revenues commission and other revenues represented approximately of our total consolidated revenue for the year ended december  commission and other revenues consist of commissions we receive in connection with the sale of money orders  enrollment fees received when consumers enroll in our equity accelerator program a recurring mortgage payment service program  revenue recorded for reimbursable costs incurred to operate payment services programs and investment income primarily derived from interest generated on money transfer and payment services settlement assets as well as realized net gains and losses from such assets 
cost of services cost of services includes the costs directly associated with providing services to consumers  including commissions paid to agents and billers  personnel expenses  software maintenance costs  equipment  telecommunications costs  bank fees  infrastructure costs to provide the resources and materials necessary to offer money transfer and other payment services including reimbursable costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and other operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  primarily consists of salaries  wages and related expenses paid to sales and administrative personnel  as well as certain advertising and promotional costs and other selling and administrative expenses 
prior to september   the date of the spin off  sg a also included allocations of general corporate overhead costs from first data 
interest expense interest expense represents interest incurred in connection with outstanding borrowings payable to third parties 
interest income interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances not required to satisfy settlement obligations and in connection with loans made to several agents 
interest income from first data  net interest income from first data  net consists of interest income earned on notes receivable from first data  net of interest expense incurred on notes payable to first data 
all notes receivable and payable were settled in connection with the spin off on september  derivative gains losses  net derivative gains and losses include realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with certain foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify as hedges under derivative accounting rules prior to september   and the portion of the change in fair value that is considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness related to contracts designated as accounting hedges 
table of contents entered into on or after september  derivative gains and losses do not include fluctuations in foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate exposures on settlement activities of our money transfer business or on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions 
gains and losses associated with those foreign currency forward contracts are included in operating expenses  consistent with exchange rate fluctuations on the related settlement assets  obligations and cash positions 
foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from first data  net certain of the notes receivable from first data in our consolidated balance sheets prior to september   the spin off date  were repayable in euros  and certain of those euro denominated notes also had foreign currency swap agreements associated with them 
these notes receivable were translated based on current exchange rates between the euro and the united states dollar  and changes in fair value of the related foreign currency swap agreements were recorded based on current market valuations 
the effect of translation adjustments and recording the foreign currency swaps to market is reflected in our consolidated statements of income as foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from first data 
all notes receivable and payable with first data were settled in connection with the spin off on september  other income  net other income  net is comprised primarily of equity earnings from equity investments and other income and expenses 

table of contents results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations refers to the year ended december  compared to the same period in and the year ended december  compared to the same period in the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the discussion of our segment results of operations  which provide more detailed discussions concerning certain components of the consolidated statements of income 
all significant intercompany accounts and transactions between our company s segments have been eliminated 
the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and years ended december  change in millions  except per share amounts vs

consolidated revenue growth of and 
table of contents during the years ended december  and  respectively  was driven by revenue growth in our international business as defined in segment discussion due to increased money transfers at existing agent locations  and to a lesser extent  money transfers at new agent locations 
international revenue represented  and of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our international consumer to consumer transactions that were originated outside of the united states continued to display strong transaction and revenue growth for all periods presented 
pago f cil  which was acquired in december and is primarily included in our consumer to business segment  contributed million and million of revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our acquisition of vigo in october contributed million and million in total revenue during the years ended december  and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the acquisitions of pago f cil and vigo  consolidated revenue growth for the years ended december  and compared to the previous corresponding years was and  respectively 
in addition  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the united states dollar have resulted in the following benefit or reduction to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue which represents over of our consolidated revenue over the previous year  net of foreign currency hedges  that would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange rate year ended december  in millions benefit reduction overall  consolidated revenue increased due to the strong transaction growth in our international business  and due to the impact of the acquisitions and the euro noted above 
the revenue growth experienced by our international business was offset by revenue declines in our domestic business transactions between and within the united states and canada  and to a lesser extent  the mexico business during the years ended december  and compared to the corresponding previous periods 
revenue for the years ended december  and for our united states to mexico  united states outbound and domestic businesses were adversely impacted by various factors which began in the second quarter of in the united states  including the immigration debate and subsequent general market softness  in part due to the slow down in the construction industry 
domestic and united states outbound transactions and revenues for money transfers were also impacted by a decline in transactions initiated on our website and on the telephone in the united states during the year ended december  these declines resulted primarily from additional controls implemented beginning in early by western union  card associations and issuing banks in response to credit and debit card fraud 
foreign exchange revenue increased for the years ended december  and over the corresponding previous periods  due to an increase in cross currency transactions primarily as a result of strong growth in international consumer to consumer transactions 
the overall increase in foreign exchange revenue during these periods relating to the increase in cross currency transactions was partially offset by reduced foreign exchange spreads in selected markets 
the acquisition of vigo also contributed to foreign exchange revenue growth in we have and intend to continue to implement strategic pricing reductions to reduce fees and foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and competitive factors 
pricing decreases and foreign exchange actions generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
the costs of such pricing decreases and foreign exchange actions have averaged approximately of our annual consolidated revenue over the last three years 

table of contents commission and other revenues during the year ended december   commission and other revenues increased over the previous corresponding period primarily as a result of interest income from higher money transfer and payment services settlement asset balances and higher enrollment fees from increased participation in our recurring mortgage payment service program 
commission and other revenue increased during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher investment income on money orders pending settlement and higher enrollment fees from increased participation in our recurring mortgage payment service program 
operating expenses overview incremental independent public company expenses of million and million in and  respectively  are classified within operating expenses under the captions cost of services and selling  general and administrative in the consolidated statements of income 
incremental public company expenses relate to staffing additions and related costs to replace first data support  corporate governance  information technology  corporate branding and global affairs  benefits and payroll administration  procurement  workforce reorganization  stock compensation  and other expenses related to being a stand alone public company as well as recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring key management positions new to our company  other employee compensation expenses and temporary labor used to develop ongoing processes 
these expenses are those in excess of amounts allocated to us by first data prior to september  or beyond amounts we presume first data would have allocated subsequently thereto 
we expect most of these expenses will continue to be incurred in future periods 
at the time of the spin off  first data converted stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units collectively  stock based awards of first data stock held by western union and first data employees 
both western union and first data employees received converted western union stock based awards 
all converted stock based awards  which had not vested prior to september   are subject to the terms and conditions applicable to the original first data stock based awards  including change of control provisions which require full vesting upon a change of control of first data 
accordingly  upon the completion of the acquisition of first data on september  by an affiliate of kohlberg kravis roberts co kkr  all of these remaining converted unvested western union stock based awards vested 
in connection with this accelerated vesting  we incurred a non cash pre tax charge of million during the third quarter of approximately one third of this charge was recorded within cost of services and two thirds was recorded within selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
cost of services cost of services is primarily comprised of agent commissions and also includes expenses for personnel  software  equipment  telecommunications  bank fees  depreciation and amortization and other expenses incurred in connection with providing money transfer and other payment services 
cost of services was   and of consolidated revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
overall  agent renewals in resulted in commission rates materially consistent with previous agreements 
the majority of the increase in cost of services as a percentage of revenue in compared to the corresponding period in was attributable to the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international business  which carries higher cost of services compared to our united states originated businesses 
the pago f cil business  which carries a lower margin than our existing consumer to business services  also contributed to the increase in cost of services 
the stock compensation charge resulting from the acquisition of first data by an affiliate of kkr and incremental public company expenses were additional factors leading to the increase in cost of services in  and caused cost of services to increase at a higher rate between and compared to the increase in compared to 
table of contents the majority of the increase in cost of services for the year ended december  compared to was attributable to the shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth from our international business  as described above 
another factor impacting cost of services as a percent of revenue was the october acquisition of vigo  which has higher cost of services compared to western union branded money transfers 
higher stock compensation costs in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  and higher employee incentive compensation expense also contributed to the increase in cost of services as a percent of revenue 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year primarily due to incremental public company expenses and the stock compensation charge related to kkr s acquisition of first data  as described above 
in addition  costs associated with the inclusion of the pago f cil business contributed to the increase in from selling  general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due primarily to vigo  incremental public company expenses  as discussed above  higher stock compensation expense from the adoption of sfas no 
r and higher employee incentive compensation expenses in compared to marketing related expenditures  principally classified within selling  general and administrative expenses  increased during the years ended december  and compared to the corresponding periods in the prior years 
however  marketing related expenditures as a percent of consolidated revenue were approximately  and during the years ended december   and  respectively 
marketing related expenditures include advertising  events  loyalty programs and the cost of employees dedicated to marketing activities 
when making decisions with respect to marketing investments  we review opportunities for advertising and other marketing related expenditures together with opportunities for pricing adjustments and other initiatives in order to best maximize the return on these investments 
for further discussion regarding the impact of pricing decreases refer to the transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue discussion within the consumer to consumer segment section 
interest income interest income increased during the years ended december  and compared to corresponding periods in the prior years due to higher international cash balances resulting from the net cash received in connection with the settlement of intercompany notes with first data net of certain other payments made to first data on the spin off date  and from cash generated through our international operations 
also contributing to higher interest income in and was interest income recorded in connection with a million loan made to one of our agents in the first quarter of interest expense interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million during  due to interest expense on our outstanding borrowings that arose in connection with the spin off on september  interest expense was significantly higher in since the related borrowings were outstanding for the full year compared to three months during derivative gains losses  net our foreign currency forward contracts that did not qualify as hedges under applicable derivative accounting rules were held primarily in the euro and british pound and had maturities of one year or less 
prior to september   we did not have any forward contracts that qualified as hedges  and therefore the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts were reflected within this line item in the consolidated statements of income prior to that date 
since these instruments did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  there was resulting 
table of contents volatility in our net income for the periods presented prior to september  for example  during the years ended december  and  we had pre tax derivative losses gains of million and million  respectively 
on september   we established our foreign currency forward positions to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
we anticipate the amounts reflected in this income statement caption going forward will be minimal  as such amounts will relate primarily to the portion of the change in fair value that is considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness related to contracts designated as accounting hedges 
foreign exchange effect on notes receivable from first data  net all euro denominated notes receivable with first data  and related foreign currency swap agreements were settled in connection with the spin off on september  accordingly  no amounts related to the revaluation of such notes or related swaps were recorded during the year ended december   explaining the decrease from the year ended december  no such amounts will be recognized in future periods 
prior to the spin off  the revaluation to fair market value of these euro denominated notes receivable from first data and the related foreign currency swap arrangements benefited income before income taxes for the year ended december  by million compared to a reduction to income before income taxes for the year ended december  of million 
such fluctuations corresponded to changes in the value of the euro 
interest income from first data  net interest income from first data  net consists of interest income earned on notes receivable from first data  partially offset by interest incurred on notes payable to first data 
all notes receivable and payable were settled in connection with the spin off on september   and accordingly  no such amounts were recognized during the year ended december  interest income from first data  net increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to increased average net borrowings by first data from western union affiliates 
other income  net changes in other income  net during the years ended december  and compared to the previous corresponding years were primarily attributable to fluctuations in equity earnings from equity method investments 
income taxes our effective tax rates on pretax income were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the effective tax rate over the three periods remained relatively constant 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  compared to the prior year is primarily the result of a higher proportion of foreign derived profits compared to united states derived profits our foreign derived profits are taxed at lower rates than our united states derived profits and the favorable resolution of certain income tax matters 
we have established contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures  including potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations restructured in  whereby our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
as of december   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits is a liability of million  including accrued interest and penalties 
our reserves reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserve 
with respect to these reserves  our income tax expense would include i any changes in tax reserves arising from 
table of contents material changes during the period in facts and circumstances ie new information surrounding a tax issue  and ii any difference from our tax position as recorded in the financial statements and the final resolution of a tax issue during the period 
such resolution could materially increase or decrease income tax expense in our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
earnings per share during the years ended december   and  basic earnings per share were  and  respectively  and diluted earnings per share were  and  respectively 
all issued and outstanding shares of western union common stock until the spin off on september   consisting of shares  were held by first data 
accordingly  for all periods presented prior to the spin off date of september   basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using our basic shares outstanding as of the spin off date 
unvested shares of restricted stock are excluded from basic shares outstanding 
diluted earnings per share subsequent to september  reflects the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding stock options on the presented dates are exercised and shares of restricted stock have vested 
as of december  and  there were million and million  respectively  outstanding options to purchase shares of western union stock excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation under the treasury stock method as their effect is anti dilutive 
the treasury stock method assumes proceeds from the exercise price of stock options  the unamortized compensation expense and assumed tax benefits are available to reduce the dilutive effect upon exercise 
of the million outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock as of december   approximately are held by employees of first data 
diluted earnings per share decreased during the year ended december  and compared to the previous periods due to the decrease in net income as a result of the previously described factors and the increase in diluted shares outstanding  because  as described above  prior to the september  spin off date  there were no potentially dilutive instruments outstanding 
accordingly  the potentially dilutive shares arising in connection with the spin off had no impact to and minimal impact to due to the impact of weighting 
in  the dilutive shares outstanding were outstanding for a full year 
segment discussion we manage our business around the consumers we serve and the types of services we offer 
each of our two segments addresses a different combination of consumer groups  distribution networks and services offered 
our segments are consumer to consumer money transfer services between consumers  primarily through a global network of third party agents using our multi currency  real time money transfer processing systems 
this service is available for both international cross border transfers that is  the transfer of funds from one country to another and intra country transfers that is  money transfers from one location to another in the same country 
consumer to business the processing of payments from consumers to billers through our networks of third party agents and various electronic channels 
the segment s revenue was primarily generated in the united states for all periods presented 
businesses not considered part of the segments described above are categorized as other 
in and  other also included recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to our company  and consulting costs used to develop ongoing processes in connection with completing the spin off  and expenses incurred in connection with the development of certain new service offerings  including costs to develop mobile money transfer and micro lending services 

table of contents the business segment measurements provided to  and evaluated by  our chief operating decision maker are computed in accordance with the following principles the accounting policies of the reporting segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies

revenues compared to the primary driver of consumer to consumer revenue growth are transaction fees and foreign exchange revenue 
consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth of for the year ended december  over the same period in was driven by our international business 
however  the growth experienced by our international business has been partially offset by revenue declines in our domestic and mexico businesses in international revenue growth of for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in  resulted from a increase in volume of international money transfer transactions 
our international transactions that were originated outside of the united states also continued to display strong transaction and revenue growth for the year ended december  the key strategic inbound markets of india and china continued to grow  with revenue growth of and  respectively  on transaction growth of approximately and  respectively  and these two markets combined represented approximately of western union consolidated revenues for the year ended december  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the united states dollar have resulted in benefits of million and million in and  respectively  over the previous year 
these benefits to consumer to consumer revenue would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange rate  and was net of the impact of our foreign currency hedges 
the united states to mexico  united states domestic and the united states outbound businesses were adversely impacted by various factors in the united states for the year ended december  these factors  which began in the second quarter and are discussed in more detail below  include the immigration debate  and market softness  in part due to the slowdown in the construction industry 
we responded to these factors by launching distribution  pricing  advertising  promotion and community outreach initiatives 
we have not seen transaction and revenue growth rates return to levels prior to we believe this is due primarily to market softness in the united states  in part due to a slow down in the construction industry 
although domestic transactions decreased for the year ended december  over the corresponding period in  due primarily to the factors described above and the decline in transactions initiated on our website and through the telephone  as described below  the decline in domestic transactions began to moderate during each sequential quarter in domestic revenue declined at a higher rate than transactions  due in part to the impact of price decreases and lower principal amounts sent 
transactions and revenues for money transfers initiated on our website and through the telephone declined for the year ended december  compared to the same period in transactions initiated in the united states have been  and we anticipate will continue to be  impacted by tightened controls implemented beginning in early by western union  card issuing banks and card associations in response to credit and debit card fraud in the united states 
these tightened controls have directly impacted our consumers ability to use their debit and credit cards to send money on our website and through the telephone  decreasing the volume of transactions 

table of contents card issuing banks and card associations have begun to allow more consumer transactions to be processed  in part in response to western union s own increased scrutiny of these transactions 
however  we anticipate transaction growth will continue to be impacted by these factors and consumer perceptions of their ability to transact on the website and through the telephone as a result of the additional controls that have been implemented 
while mexico transactions grew for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue declined due to price reductions taken in early however  mexico revenue and transaction growth rates began to converge during each sequential quarter in as there were no significant pricing reductions after the early part of foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the prior year due to an increase in the international business resulting in increased cross currency transactions  partially offset by reduced foreign exchange rate spreads in selected markets 
we have and intend to continue to implement strategic pricing reductions  including actions to reduce foreign exchange spreads  where appropriate  taking into account growth opportunities and competitive factors 
pricing decreases and foreign exchange actions generally reduce margins  but are done in anticipation that they will result in increased transaction volumes and increased revenues over time 
such overall pricing decreases and foreign exchange actions have averaged approximately of our annual consolidated revenue over the last three years  a trend that is expected to continue 
contributing to the increase in total consumer to consumer money transfer revenue and transaction growth in all periods presented was the growth in transactions at existing agent locations  the increased number of agent locations and marketing campaigns promoting western union services 
the majority of transaction growth is derived from more mature agent locations  new agent locations typically contribute only marginally to revenue growth in the first few years of their operation 
increased productivity  measured by transactions per location  is often experienced as locations mature 
we believe that new agent locations will help drive growth by increasing the number of locations available to send and receive money 
we generally refer to locations with more than of transactions being initiated versus paid as send locations and to the balance of locations as receive locations 
send locations are the engine that drives consumer to consumer revenue 
they contribute more transactions per location than receive locations 
however  a wide network of receive locations is necessary to build each corridor and to help ensure global distribution 
the number of send and receive transactions at an agent location can vary significantly due to such factors as customer demographics around the location  immigration patterns  the location s class of trade  hours of operation  length of time the location has been offering our services  regulatory limitations and competition 
each of the more than  agent locations in our agent network is capable of providing one or more of our services  however  not every location completes a transaction in a given period 
for example  as of december   more than of agent locations in the united states  canada and western europe representing at least one of our three money transfer brands experienced money transfer activity in the last months 
in the developing regions of asia and other areas where there are predominantly receive locations  more than of locations experienced money transfer activity in the last months 
we periodically review locations to determine whether they remain enabled to perform money transfer transactions 
compared to consumer to consumer money transfer revenue growth for the year ended december  over the same period in was driven by international revenue growth and the acquisition of vigo  which was completed in october vigo contributed million and million in total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this revenue growth was offset by declines in our domestic businesses and a slow down in revenue growth in our mexico business  both of which began in the second quarter of 
table of contents international revenue growth in the year ended december  compared to the same period in resulted from growth in money transfer transactions and the acquisition of vigo 
international money transfer transaction growth in the year ended december  compared to the prior year period was driven most significantly by growth in the united states and european outbound businesses 
the international transaction growth rate excluding vigo for the year ended december  of and was directionally consistent with the growth rate for the comparable period in although international intra country transaction growth remained strong in  the overall international transaction growth rate during was impacted by high transaction growth rates experienced in the intra country business in the second half of  particularly in the philippines 
the key inbound markets of india and china continued to grow  with transactions in india more than doubling and china transaction growth rates exceeding for the year ended december  for the year ended december   india and china combined represented approximately of western union consolidated revenues 
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the united states dollar have resulted in a benefit or reduction to consumer to consumer transaction fee and foreign exchange revenue of million and million in and  respectively  over the previous corresponding year 
this benefit or reduction to consumer to consumer revenue would not have occurred had there been a constant exchange rate  and was net of the impact of our foreign currency hedges 
the relationship between international transaction growth and revenue growth was relatively consistent during the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in transactions related to vigo  which have lower revenue per transaction compared to the western union branded business  benefited transactions more than revenue 
offsetting this impact was the benefit to revenue from the euro described above  which did not have a corresponding benefit to transactions compared to revenue for the year ended december  for our united states to mexico  united states outbound and domestic businesses was adversely impacted by various factors in the united states  including the immigration debate  which raised concerns with certain consumers in the united states and decreased the frequency of money transfers from the united states to mexico and other countries 
these concerns  together with general market softness  in part due to the slow down in the construction industry  led some competitors to lower fees and reduce foreign exchange spreads in certain markets 
in  western union was also impacted by the actions of the office of attorney general in the state of arizona which also may have added to the uncertainty with some of our consumers 
the arizona attorney general seized money transfers initiated in arizona during certain periods in  and  in september  sought to seize money transfers originated in other states and intended for payment in certain areas of mexico 
western union obtained an injunction preventing such seizures  and the arizona attorney general has appealed that injunction 
furthermore  the arizona attorney general sought personal information about a large number of western union customers outside of arizona  which efforts western union has resisted in court 
we believe that these events and the publicity they created led some consumers to avoid western union s services in late and early western union remains in litigation with the arizona attorney general on these matters 
we believe that our legal position is sound  and the publicity surrounding these matters has largely abated 
domestic transaction growth rates in the year ended december  over the same period in declined compared to increases observed for the year due in part to the uncertainty created by the immigration debate described above  and broader market softness experienced within the united states domestic business in growth in mexico money transfer transactions for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was driven by the acquisition of vigo and growth in western union branded transactions 
the 
table of contents decline in revenue growth rates was primarily due to the uncertainty created by the immigration debate in the united states as described above 
foreign exchange revenue increased for the year ended december  due to the acquisition of vigo and an increase in the higher growth international business resulting in increased cross currency transactions 
operating income the consumer to consumer segment s operating income increased by for the year ended december  compared to the corresponding period in this increase was primarily driven by increased revenue in our international business 
operating income during the year ended december  was impacted by the ongoing shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth in our international business  which carries lower profit margins than in our united states originated businesses 
however  we have been experiencing a convergence between international operating profit margins and profit margins of our united states originated businesses 
operating income during the year ended december  was adversely impacted by incremental public company expenses which are incremental to both costs allocated by first data prior to the spin off and presumed overhead allocations from first data had we remained part of first data 
such incremental public company expenses include salaries  benefits  equipment  supplies and other costs incurred in connection with operating as a separate public company 
in addition  we recognized an accelerated non cash stock compensation charge of million taken in connection with the change in control of first data  of which was allocated to the consumer to consumer segment 
the consumer to consumer segment s operating income increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to an increase in revenue and by lower escheatment accruals resulting from charges incurred in that did not recur in these benefits to operating income during the year ended december  were partially offset by the ongoing shift in our business mix reflecting stronger growth in our international business  and incremental public company expenses as discussed above

in december  we acquired the remaining interest in pago f cil 
prior to the acquisition  we held a interest in pago f cil 
this acquisition contributed million and million in revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which million and million related to our consumer to business segment in the years ended december  and  respectively

transaction growth  excluding pago f cil  was during the year ended december   compared to the same period in for the year ended december   other consumer to business segment revenue increased compared to the corresponding period in due to higher investment income on settlement asset balances as well as higher enrollment fees from increased participation in our recurring mortgage payment service program 
compared to transaction and revenue growth in the year ended december  compared to the same period in also resulted from strong transaction growth in electronic bill payments  and to a lesser extent  the acquisition of pago f cil described above 
the growth rates in compared to also benefited from cash bill payments experiencing a slight revenue growth for the year ended december  versus a decline in as our western union convenience pay or convenience pay business benefited from the addition of a large new biller client in the third quarter of which had a positive impact to transaction and revenue growth rates for the year ended december  compared to the same period in other consumer to business segment revenue increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due to higher enrollment fees from increased participation in our recurring mortgage payment service program  and higher investment income on settlement asset balances 
operating income operating income for the consumer to business segment was unchanged for the year ended december  compared to the same period in because of the impact of pago f cil and revenue growth in the segment s electronic based services businesses  and was offset by incremental public company expenses and the accelerated stock compensation charge taken in connection with the change in control of first data 
operating income for the period grew at a lower rate than revenues as pago f cil and the electronic based services have lower operating margins compared to those in the segment s other services  as well as the incremental public company expenses and accelerated stock compensation charge noted above 
for the year ended december   operating income increased at a slower rate than revenue growth over the same period in the shift in the united states to electronic based products  as discussed above  negatively impacted operating income

we previously operated internet auction payments  messaging and international prepaid cellular top up businesses  which were shut down or disposed of in and early revenue remained relatively constant for the year ended december   due to moderate growth in our money order and prepaid services businesses  offset by the loss of revenue from our shut down or disposed of businesses  which generated revenue for a portion of  while none of those businesses generated revenue in the decline in revenue for these shut down businesses also contributed to the decrease in the year ended december  compared to as these businesses contributed to the entire year in  but only a portion of the year in first data  through its subsidiary integrated payment systems  issues our western union branded money orders 
we do not believe first data s announcement of its plan to exit its official check and money order business will have a significant impact on us  as first data has a money order processing contract with us through we believe we have adequate time to replace the services currently provided by first data 
operating income for the year ended december   the increase in operating income was driven by modest growth from our prepaid services 
for the year ended december   the increase in operating income was driven by the money order business and the elimination of operating losses of the businesses shut down or disposed of primarily in  partially offset by recruiting and relocation expenses associated with hiring senior management positions new to our company and consulting costs used to develop ongoing processes  all in connection with the spin off from first data 
aggregate operating income related to the shut down or disposed of businesses  including a gain on the sale of assets related to our internet auction payments business  for the year ended december  was million 
the aggregate operating loss associated with such businesses in the year ended december  was million 
further financial information relating to each of our segments external revenue  operating profit measures and total assets is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
capital resources and liquidity our primary source of liquidity has been cash generated from our operating activities  driven primarily from net income  and also impacted by fluctuations in working capital 
our working capital is affected by the timing of interest payments on our outstanding borrowings  timing of income tax payments  and collections on receivables  among other items 
the majority of our interest payments are due in the second and fourth quarter which results in a decrease in the amount of cash provided by operating activities in those quarters  and a corresponding increase to the first and third quarter 

table of contents our future cash flows generated from operating activities could be impacted by a variety of factors  some of which are out of our control  including changes in economic conditions  especially those impacting the migrant population  and changes in income tax laws or the status of income tax audits 
a significant portion of our cash flows from operating activities has been generated from subsidiaries  some of which are regulated entities 
these subsidiaries may transfer all excess cash flows generated to the parent company for general corporate use  except for a cash balances related to foreign earnings which have been taxed at a more favorable income tax rate than the combined united states federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the united states indefinitely  b assets located in countries outside of the united states containing legal or regulatory restrictions from being transferred outside of those countries  and c cash and investment balances that are maintained by regulated subsidiaries to secure certain money transfer obligations initiated in the united states in accordance with applicable state regulations in the united states 
significant changes in the regulatory environment for money transmitters could impact our primary source of liquidity 
as of december   we have cash and cash equivalents of  million 
we also have a billion revolving credit facility available to meet additional short term liquidity needs that might arise  and available to support borrowings under our commercial paper program 
taking into account our projected share repurchases  dividends  capital expenditures  and debt service during  we believe our cash flows generated from operating activities and available financing sources will provide us with an adequate source of liquidity to meet the needs of our business 
cash and investment securities our foreign entities held  million and million of our cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  and  respectively 
we currently plan to invest the majority of these funds through these foreign entities 
repatriating these funds to the united states would  in many cases  result in significant tax obligations because most of these funds have been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the united states 
we expect to use these funds in expanding our international operations and acquiring businesses overseas 
we expect to receive and hold funds from money transfers and certain other payment services before we settle with payment recipients 
these funds  referred to as settlement assets on our consolidated balance sheets  are not used to support our operations 
however  we earn income from investing these funds 
we maintain a portion of these settlement assets in highly liquid investments  classified as cash and cash equivalents within settlement assets  to fund settlement obligations 
a portion of our settlement assets are held in investment securities  substantially all of which are highly rated state and municipal debt instruments  totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
most state regulators in the united states require us to maintain specific high quality  investment grade securities and such investments are intended to secure relevant outstanding settlement obligations in accordance with applicable regulations 
we do not hold financial instruments for trading purposes  and all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  which is based primarily on market quotations 
investment securities are exposed to market risk due to changes in interest rates and credit risk 
we regularly monitor credit risk and attempt to mitigate our exposure by making high quality investments 
as of december   substantially all of our investment securities had credit ratings of aa or better from a major credit rating agency 
the credit quality of the majority of our investment portfolio was aaa 
our investment securities are also actively managed with respect to concentration 
as of december   no individual security represented more than of our investment securities portfolio 

table of contents the third party issuer of western union branded money orders holds the settlement assets generated from the sale of western union money orders  and maintains the responsibility for investing those funds 
based on the terms of the contract with the issuer  we are provided with a fixed rate of return on the funds awaiting settlement 
cash flows from operating activities during the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities was  million and  million  respectively 
cash flows provided by operating activities was consistent between and  despite decreased net income 
the decrease in net income was  in part  due to increased non cash charges which did not decrease cash flows 
cash flows from operating activities also benefited from favorable working capital fluctuations in cash provided by operating activities increased to  million during the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  driven by consumer to consumer transaction growth  despite a slight decrease in net income 
net income for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by higher non cash charges that did not impact cash flows relating to stock compensation in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r in  higher amortization expense related to higher intangible asset balances in connection with the acquisition of vigo  and also higher amortization expense as a result of certain large strategic agent contracts being executed earlier in the year for which initial payments were made 
the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities also benefited from the delay in the payment of accrued income taxes from to discussed above  while income taxes relating to all four quarters in were paid to first data during financing resources as of december  and  we have the following outstanding borrowings in millions due in less than one year commercial paper note payable  due january floating rate notes  due due in greater than one year floating rate notes  due notes  net of discount  due a notes  net of discount  due notes  net of discount  due total borrowings a includes the fair market value of million relating to an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million

as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings and had approximately billion available for borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility is used to provide general liquidity for the company and to support our commercial paper program  which we believe enhances our short term credit rating 
if the amount available to borrow under the revolving credit facility decreased  or if the revolving credit facility were eliminated  the cost and availability of borrowing under the commercial paper program may be impacted 
amounts available to borrow under this facility are limited by outstanding commercial paper borrowings 
notes on september   we issued billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured notes maturing on october  the notes

we may redeem the floating rate notes at any time on or after may   at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the floating rate notes to be redeemed plus accrued interest on the date of redemption 
debt service requirements our debt service requirements will include payments on existing borrowings and any future borrowings under our commercial paper program  the payment due on the maturity of our million floating rate notes in and interest payments 
we have the ability to use existing financing sources  such as our 
table of contents revolving credit facility and commercial paper program  to meet debt obligations as they arise 
currently we intend to refinance our floating rate notes in with new financing sources  depending on market conditions 
additionally  we may convert a portion of our commercial paper program into longer term borrowings in based on market conditions at the time such re financings occur  we may not be able to obtain new financings under similar conditions as historically reported 
as discussed in cash and investment securities above  a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents on hand at december  is held by foreign entities  some of which has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rate in the united states 
we currently plan to invest such funds through these foreign entities 
however  if we change our plans or are required to change our plans in order to use these cash and cash equivalents for debt service  we would incur significant tax obligations 
credit ratings and debt covenants the credit ratings on our debt are an important consideration in managing our financing costs and facilitating access to additional capital on favorable terms 
factors that we believe are important in assessing our credit ratings include earnings  cash flow generation  leverage  available liquidity and overall business risks 
our revolving credit facility contains a facility fee and a utilization fee  determined based on our credit rating assigned by s p and or moody s  as further described above 
we do not have any other terms within our debt agreements or other contracts that are tied to changes in our credit ratings

our credit ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
we cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 
a significant downgrade or an indication that a significant downgrade may occur could result in the following our access to the commercial paper market may be limited  and if we were downgraded below investment grade  our access to the commercial paper market would likely be eliminated  our borrowing costs on certain existing borrowings would increase  we may be required to pay a higher interest rate in future financings  our potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease  regulators may impose additional capital and other requirements on us  including imposing restrictions on the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends  and our agent relationships may be adversely impacted  particularly those agents that are financial institutions or post offices 
the indenture governing our notes and the revolving credit facility all contain covenants which  among other things  limit or restrict our ability to grant certain types of security interests  enter into sale and leaseback transactions or incur certain subsidiary level indebtedness 
in addition  the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of greater than ratio of consolidated ebitda  as defined 
table of contents in the agreement  to interest expense for each period comprising the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters 
our consolidated interest coverage ratio was as of december  as of december   we are in compliance with our debt covenants 
a violation of our debt covenants could impair our ability to borrow  and outstanding amounts borrowed could become due  thereby restricting our ability to use our excess cash for other purposes 
cash priorities capital expenditures total aggregate amount capitalized for contract costs  purchases of property and equipment  and purchased and developed software was million in amounts capitalized for new and renewed agent contracts were million during the year 
such contract costs will vary depending on the terms of existing contracts as well as the timing of when new contracts are signed or renewed 
other capital expenditures during included purchased and developed software costs and purchases of property and equipment representing investments in our information technology infrastructure and the renovation of certain facilities 
acquisition of businesses  net of cash acquired in december  we acquired pago f cil for a total purchase price of million  less cash acquired of million 
during  first data acquired of vigo  which was later transferred to us as part of the spin off  for a total purchase price of million  net of cash acquired of million resulting in a net cash outflow of million 
we expect that we will continue to pursue opportunities to acquire companies  particularly outside of the united states  that complement our existing businesses worldwide 
return value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends we have two programs which allow us to repurchase shares 
in september  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to billion of our common stock through december  in december   our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to an additional billion of our common stock through december  as of december   million shares have been repurchased for million at an average cost of per share 
as of december   billion remains available under these two programs 
during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors declared an annual cash dividend of per common share  representing million  which was paid in december during the fourth quarter of  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per common share  representing million  which was paid in december equity investments in and loans to certain key agents in october  we entered into agreements totaling million to convert our non participating interest in a joint venture with our singapore agent  hersing corporation ltd  into a fully participating equity interest and extended the agent relationship at more favorable commission rates to western union 
as a result  we will now earn a pro rata share of profits and will have enhanced voting rights 
we also have the right to add additional agent relationships in singapore under this agreement 
also in october  we completed an agreement to acquire a ownership interest in gracekennedy money services caribbean srl gracekennedy  an agent in jamaica which also acts as our agent in several other caribbean countries  and to extend the term of the agent relationship for million 
the aggregate consideration paid resulted in million of identifiable intangible assets  which are being amortized over seven to years 

table of contents from time to time  we also make advances and loans to agents 
most significantly  in the first quarter  we signed a six year agreement with one of our existing agents which included a four year loan of million to the agent  of which million and million was repaid in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the terms of the loan agreement require that a percentage of commissions earned by the agent in and in be withheld as repayment of the loan and the agent remains obligated to repay the loan if commissions earned are not sufficient 
the remaining loan receivable balance relating to this agent as of december  and  net of discount  was million and million  respectively 
as opportunities arise  we expect we will continue to strategically invest in agents to further strengthen our business 
our ability to continue to grow the business  make acquisitions  and return capital to shareholders  primarily through share repurchases will depend on our ability to continue to generate excess operating cash through our operating subsidiaries and to continue to receive dividends from those operating subsidiaries  our ability to obtain adequate financing and our ability to identify the appropriate acquisitions that will align with our long term strategy 
prior to spin off from first data prior to the spin off  excess cash generated from our domestic operations that was not required to meet certain regulatory requirements was periodically advanced to first data and was reflected as a receivable from first data 
in addition  we periodically paid dividends to first data 
first data and its subsidiaries provided a number of services on behalf of our business  including shared services  which were reimbursed periodically 
also  when we were a segment of first data  we benefited from first data s financing resources 
off balance sheet arrangements other than facility and equipment leasing arrangements disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have no material off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
pension plans we have two frozen defined benefit plans that together were underfunded by million as of december  during the period from to  we did not make a contribution to these plans  and based on current asset return calculations and minimum funding requirements  no such contribution is required in the measurement date for our pension plans is september thus  during the third quarter of each year  management reviews and  if necessary  adjusts the assumptions associated with its pension plans 
during  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas no 
  and r sfas no 
 the measurement dates for our pension plans will be changed to december the calculation of the funded status and net periodic benefit income is dependent upon two primary assumptions expected long term return on plan assets  and discount rate 
our expected long term return on plan assets was for and if actual asset returns exceed the expected return on plan assets by basis points  the plans funded status would improve by million 
the discount rate assumption for the company s benefit obligation was and for and  respectively 
a basis point change in 
table of contents the discount rate would change the funded status by million 
due to the frozen status of our plans  a basis point change in these assumptions would not be significant to the net periodic benefit income or expense of our plans 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations to third parties as of december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years borrowings  including interest a purchase obligations b foreign currency forward contracts c operating leases unrecognized tax benefits d capitalized contract costs e estimated pension funding f a we have estimated our interest payments based on i projected libor rates in calculating interest on commercial paper borrowings and floating rate notes  ii projected commercial paper borrowings outstanding throughout  and the assumption that no such amounts will be outstanding on or after december   and iii the assumption that no debt issuances or renewals will occur upon the maturity dates of our fixed and floating rate notes 
our floating rate notes mature in november and we plan to refinance these notes in with new financing sources 
b many of our contracts contain clauses that allow us to terminate the contract with notice  and with or without a termination penalty 
termination penalties are generally an amount less than the original obligation 
certain contracts also have an automatic renewal clause if we do not provide written notification of our intent to terminate the contract 
obligations under certain contracts are usage based and are  therefore  estimated in the above amounts 
historically  we have not had any significant defaults of our contractual obligations or incurred significant penalties for termination of our contractual obligations 
c represents the liability position of our foreign currency forward contracts as of december   which will fluctuate based on market conditions 
d the timing of cash payments on unrecognized tax benefits  including accrued interest and penalties  is inherently uncertain because the ultimate amount and timing of such liabilities is affected by factors which are variable and outside our control 
e represents accrued and unpaid initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts as of december  f we have estimated our pension plan funding requirements using assumptions that are consistent with pension legislation enacted during the actual minimum required amounts each year will vary based on the actual discount rate and asset returns when the funding requirement is calculated 
other commercial commitments we had million in outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees at december   with expiration dates through  certain of which contain a one year renewal option 
the letters of credit and bank guarantees are held primarily in connection with lease arrangements and certain agent agreements 
we expect to renew the letters of credit and bank guarantees prior to their expiration in most circumstances 

table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based on our financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues  expenses  assets  liabilities and other related disclosures 
actual results may or may not differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in  financial statements and supplementary data 
our critical accounting policies  described below  are very important to the portrayal of our financial position and our results of operations and applying them requires our management to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
we believe that the understanding of these key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into our operating results and financial condition 
description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions stock based compensation we have stock based compensation plans  which include stock options  restricted stock awards and units  unrestricted stock awards  and other equity based awards granted to employees and other key individuals who perform services for the company 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  and note  stock compensation plans  to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
we currently utilize the black scholes merton option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
option pricing models require us to estimate a number of key valuation inputs including expected volatility  expected dividend yield  expected term and risk free interest rate 
the most subjective estimates are the expected volatility of the underlying stock and the expected term when determining the fair market value of an option granted 
based on the limited amount of trading history of our common stock as a stand alone public company  we utilized a peer group to estimate the volatility assumption when calculating the fair value of stock options granted in late and in addition  our expected option terms are based in part on stock option exercise activity when we were part of first data 
our volatility and expected option term assumptions could be significantly different going forward than what we have estimated for historical grants which could impact our stock based compensation expense in future periods 
a change in our stock based compensation expense for the year ended december   would have affected pre tax income by approximately million 
income taxes income taxes income taxes  as reported in our consolidated financial statements  represent the net amount of income taxes we expect to pay to various taxing jurisdictions in connection with our operations 
we provide for income taxes based on amounts that we believe we will ultimately owe after applying the analyses and judgments required under the provisions of sfas no 
and fin with respect to earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions  we have provided for income taxes on such earnings at a more favorable income tax rate than the combined united states federal and state income tax rates because we expect to reinvest these earnings outside of the united states indefinitely 
at december   no provision had been made for united states federal and state income taxes on foreign earnings of approximately billion  which are expected to be reinvested outside the united states indefinitely 
if we were to repatriate those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise to the united states  the company would be subject to united states income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits  state income taxes and possible withholding taxes payable to various foreign countries which could result in a material impact to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the period such repatriation occurred 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions income tax contingencies under the provisions of fin  we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits of the position  that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
we have established contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures  a substantial portion of which relate to potential tax audit adjustments with respect to our international operations  which were restructured in  whereby our income from certain foreign to foreign money transfer transactions has been taxed at relatively low foreign tax rates compared to our combined federal and state tax rates in the united states 
the internal revenue service irs is conducting audits of the united states federal consolidated income tax returns of first data for the years through  which include our taxable results for those years 
we currently contemplate that the irs will complete the examination phase of its audit for these years during our tax contingency reserves for our uncertain tax positions as of december  were million including interest and penalties 
while we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  in the event that the ultimate resolution of our uncertain tax positions differ from our estimates  particularly with respect to our restructuring of our international operations  we may be exposed to material increases or decreases in income tax expense  which could materially impact our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
tax allocation agreement with first data pursuant to a tax allocation agreement signed in connection with our spin off from first data  we and first data each are liable for taxes imposed on our respective businesses both prior to and after the spin off 
we are in the process of resolving certain tax matters with first data relating to periods prior to the spin off 
under the tax allocation agreement  with respect to taxes and other liabilities that could be imposed as a result of a final determination that is inconsistent with the anticipated tax consequences of the spin off as set forth in the private letter ruling and relevant tax opinion  we may be liable to first data for all or a portion of any such taxes or liabilities 
although we believe that we have appropriately apportioned such taxes between first data and us through  subsequent adjustments may occur 
if we are required to indemnify first data for taxes incurred as a result of the spin off being taxable to first data  it likely would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
derivative financial instruments we utilize derivative instruments to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk 
we recognize all derivative instruments in other assets and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value 
certain of our derivative arrangements are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges at the time of inception  and others are not designated as hedges in accordance with sfas no 
cash flow hedges cash flow hedges consist of foreign currency hedging of forecasted sales and hedges of anticipated fixed rate debt issuances 
derivative value changes that are captured in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods the hedged item affects earnings  to the the accounting guidance related to derivative accounting is complex and contains strict documentation requirements 
the details of each designated hedging relationship must be formally documented at the inception of the arrangement  including the risk management objective  hedging strategy  hedged item  specific risks being hedged  the derivative instrument  how effectiveness is being assessed and how ineffectiveness  if any  will be measured 
the derivative must be highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flows or fair value of the hedged item  and effectiveness is evaluated quarterly on a retrospective and prospective basis 
while we expect that our derivative instruments that currently qualify for hedge accounting will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings which could have a significant impact on our reported earnings 
as of december   the cumulative amount of unrealized losses classified within accumulated other comprehensive loss that would be reflected in earnings if our hedges were disqualified from hedge accounting  net of income taxes  was million 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions extent the change in the fair value of the instrument is effective in offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item 
the portion of the change in fair value that is either considered ineffective or is excluded from the measure of effectiveness is recognized immediately in the income statement 
fair value hedges fair value hedges consist of hedges of fixed rate debt  through interest rate swaps 
the changes in fair value of these hedges  along with offsetting changes in fair value of the related debt instrument are recorded in interest expense 
if the hedge is no longer deemed effective  we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively 
capitalized costs we capitalize certain initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts 
these capitalized costs are classified in our consolidated balance sheets as other intangible assets 
we evaluate such other intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
in such reviews  estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets are compared with their carrying amounts to determine if a write down to fair value normally measured by the present value technique is required 
the capitalization of initial payments for new and renewed contracts is subject to strict accounting policy criteria and requires management judgment as to the appropriate time to initiate capitalization 
our accounting policy is to limit the amount of capitalized costs for a given contract to the lesser of the estimated future cash flows from the contract or the termination fees we would receive in the event of early termination of the contract 
disruptions to an agent relationship  significant declines in cash flows or transaction volumes associated with an agent contract  or other issues significantly impacting an agent s business could require us to evaluate the recoverability of our capitalized initial payments for new and renewed agent contracts prior to the annual assessment 
these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in impairment charges in the future which could significantly impact our reported earnings in the periods such charges occur 
we did not record any impairment charges related to other intangible assets during the years ended december   or the net carrying value of our capitalized contract costs at december  was million 

table of contents description judgments and uncertainties effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill impairment testing we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered to have a potential impairment and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
however  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to determine the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill  by comparing the reporting unit s fair value to the allocated fair values of all assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we also have subsidiaries within our consolidated group with stand alone reporting requirements 
goodwill testing with respect to these subsidiaries is tested for impairment at the subsidiary level using that subsidiary s reporting units  which differ from our consolidated reporting units 
accordingly  if a goodwill impairment loss were recognized at the subsidiary level  a resulting impairment loss would be recorded at the consolidated level only to the extent that the consolidated reporting unit  where the subsidiary resides  experienced an impairment loss 
we calculate the fair value of each reporting unit through discounted cash flow analyses which require us to make estimates and assumptions including  among other items  revenue growth rates  operating margins  and capital expenditures based on our budgets and business plans which take into account expected  regulatory  marketplace and other economic factors 
there are also judgments around the determination of our reporting units 
reporting units are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  referred to as a component 
we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill prior to the annual assessment if we experience disruptions to the business  unexpected significant declines in operating results  a divestiture of a significant component of our business  significant declines in market capitalization or other triggering events 
in addition  as our business or the way we manage our business changes  our reporting units may also change 
these types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment charges in the future which could materially impact our reported earnings in the periods such charges occur 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december  was  million which represented approximately of our consolidated assets 
during  we recognized an impairment charge of million relating to our ownership interest in eposs limited eposs due to a change in strategic direction 
this impairment was recognized at both the subsidiary reporting unit and consolidated reporting unit level as eposs was its own reporting unit for stand alone and consolidated financial reporting 
we have not recorded any other goodwill impairments during the three years ended december

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices  including movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
a risk management program is in place to manage these risks 
foreign currency exchange rates we provide money transfer services in more than countries and territories 
we manage foreign exchange risk through the structure of the business and an active risk management process 
we settle with the vast majority of our agents in united states dollars or euros 
however  in certain circumstances  we settle in the agent s local currency 
we typically require the agent to obtain local currency to pay recipients  thus  we generally are not reliant on international currency markets to obtain and pay illiquid currencies 
the foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid within hours 
table of contents after they are initiated 
to mitigate this risk further  we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts  generally with maturities from a few days up to three weeks  to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations between transaction initiation and settlement 
we also utilize foreign currency forward contracts  typically with terms of less than one year at inception  to offset foreign exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated cash positions 
in certain consumer money transfer transactions involving different send and receive currencies  we generate revenue based on the difference between the exchange rate set by us to the consumer and the rate at which we or our agents are able to acquire currency  helping to provide protection against currency fluctuations 
our policy is not to speculate in foreign currencies and we promptly buy and sell foreign currencies as necessary to cover our net payables and receivables which are denominated in foreign currencies 
we use longer term foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues denominated primarily in the euro  british pound and canadian dollar 
in february  we revised certain guidelines related to our longer term foreign currency forward contracts  which we designate as hedges  to allow us to use contracts with maturities of up to months at inception to mitigate some of the risk related to forecasted revenues  with a targeted weighted average maturity of approximately one year at any point in time 
prior to revising our guidelines with respect to such longer term foreign currency forward contracts  maturities at inception were generally one year or less 
we expect that the extension of the maturity of certain of our hedges will provide additional predictability of future cash flows from our international operations and allow us to better manage and mitigate risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
prior to september   we did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges under the provisions of sfas no 
as a result  changes in the fair market value of our outstanding derivative instruments  which are impacted primarily by fluctuations in the euro  have been recognized in derivative gains losses  net in the consolidated statement of income for all derivatives entered into prior to september  since these instruments were not designated to qualify for hedge accounting treatment  there was resulting volatility in our net income for the periods presented prior to september  for example  during the years ended december  and  we had pre tax derivative losses gains of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the united states dollar relative to all other currencies in which our profits are generated would result in a decrease increase to pretax annual income of approximately million based on the company s forecast of unhedged exposure to foreign currency at december  there are inherent limitations in this sensitivity analysis  primarily due to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous  the unhedged exposure is static  and that the company would not hedge any additional exposure 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 
interest rates we invest in several types of interest bearing assets  with a total value at december  of billion 
most of this amount is sensitive to changes in interest rates  and is included in our consolidated balance sheets within cash and cash equivalents and settlement assets 
such assets classified as cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and are readily convertible to cash 
to the extent these assets are held in connection with money transfers and other related payment services awaiting redemption  they are classified as settlement assets 
earnings on these investments will increase and decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates 
substantially all of the remainder of our portfolio consists of highly rated  fixed rate municipal bonds  which may include investments made from cash received from our money transfer business and other related payment 
table of contents services awaiting redemption classified within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
as interest rates rise  the fair market value of these fixed rate interest bearing securities will decrease  conversely  a decrease to interest rates would result in an increase to the fair market values of the securities 
we have classified these investments as available for sale within settlement assets in the consolidated balance sheets  and accordingly  recorded these instruments at their fair market value with the net unrealized gains and losses  net of the applicable deferred income tax effect  being added to or deducted from our total stockholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   million of our total  million in debt carries a floating interest rate or matures in such a short period that the financing is effectively a floating rate position 
of this floating rate debt  million bears interest based on the three month libor plus basis points and is reset quarterly  and million represents commercial paper with a weighted average interest rate of approximately and a weighted average initial term of days 
the company reviews its overall exposure to floating and fixed rates by evaluating our net asset position in each  also considering duration of the individual positions 
the company actively manages this mix of fixed versus floating exposure in an attempt to minimize risk  reduce costs  and optimize returns 
portfolio exposure to interest rates can be modified by changing the mix of our interest bearing assets  as well as adjusting the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt 
the latter is accomplished primarily through the use of interest rate swaps and the decision regarding terms of any new debt issuances ie  fixed versus floating 
we revised certain guidelines in february and have begun  through the use of interest rate swaps designated as hedges  to increase the percent of floating rate debt  subject to market conditions 
for example  during june  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates in our debt portfolio 
our weighted average interest rate on our borrowings  including our hedges  outstanding at december  was approximately 
a hypothetical uniform basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease to pretax income of approximately million annually based on borrowings on december  that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations 
the same basis point increase in interest rates  if applied to our cash and investment balances on december  that are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  would result in an offsetting benefit to pre tax income of approximately million annually 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rate changes would be instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  including changes in credit risk regarding our investments  which may positively or negatively affect income 
in addition the current mix of fixed versus floating rate debt and investments and the level of assets and liabilities will change over time 
credit risk the company s interest earning assets include money market fund investments  which are classified in cash and cash equivalents  and investment securities  substantially all of which are highly rated state and municipal debt instruments  which are classified in settlement assets and accounted for as available for sale securities 
credit risk is significantly mitigated in the money market funds by both the short duration of the funds  as well as the diversification provided by the fund format 
substantially all of our investment securities are rated aa or better from a major credit rating agency 
the company is actively monitoring these positions in light of recent credit market events in the united states and abroad 
given the nature of the company s portfolio  we do not expect significant impacts to our portfolio 
during the year ended december   we did not incur any impairment charges on our interest earning assets
