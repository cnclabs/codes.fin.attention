during  the demand for the transportation of petrochemical products and gasoline blending components remained strong  with term contract customers continuing to operate their plants and facilities at high utilization rates  resulting in high tank barge utilization 
the black oil products market contributed of marine transportation revenue 
this market also remained strong throughout as refineries continued to operate at close to full capacity  generating high demand for the transportation of heavier residual oil by products by barge 
the refined petroleum products market contributed of marine transportation revenue  experiencing strong demand for the movement of product from the gulf coast to the midwest 
the agricultural chemical market  which contributed of marine transportation revenue  was seasonally weak during the first quarter and strong during the balance of the year  fueled by the heavy demand for the movement of liquid fertilizer from the gulf coast to the midwest 
during the second half  approximately of the marine transportation revenues were generated by term contracts and were spot market contracts  compared with a term contract and spot market mix for the first half of rates on term contract renewals  net of fuel  increased during in the to average range  with some contracts increasing by a higher percentage and some by a lower percentage 
effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of multi year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts by to

diesel engine services during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its diesel engine services segment  of which was generated through service and from direct parts sales 
the results of the diesel engine services segment are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the industries it serves 
the following table shows the markets serviced by the company  the revenue distribution for  and the customers for each market revenue markets serviced distribution customers marine inland river carriers dry and liquid  offshore towing dry and liquid  offshore oilfield services drilling rigs supply boats  harbor towing  dredging  great lakes ore carriers power generation standby power generation  pumping stations railroad passenger transit systems  class ii  shortline  industrial the company s diesel engine services segment s revenue and operating income increased and  respectively  compared with the results were positively impacted by the accretive acquisitions of global  mes  p s and saunders  more fully described under acquisitions below  as well as from continued strong in house and in field service activities and direct parts sales in the majority of its markets  continued high labor utilization  and higher service rates and parts pricing implemented during and the diesel engine services segment s operating margin for improved to compared with for  reflecting the accretive acquisitions of global  mes  the nordberg engine assets and technology  p s and saunders  stronger markets  increased pricing for service and parts  and higher labor utilization 
cash flow and capital expenditures the company continued to generate strong operating cash flow during  with net cash provided by operating activities of  a increase compared with  in in addition  during  the company generated cash from the exercise of stock options of  and from the disposition of assets of  cash and borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility were used for capital expenditures of  including  for new tank barge and towboat construction and  primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation fleet  and  for the acquisitions  which included saunders  cypress  coastal  p s  the nordberg engine assets and technology  seven tank barges from shipyard  nine tank barges from siemens and the purchase of three towboats 
the company s debt to capitalization ratio decreased to at december  from at december   primarily due to the increase in stockholders equity attributable to net earnings for of  the exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock  and lower borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the company projects that capital expenditures for will be in the  to  range  including approximately  for new tank barge and towboat construction 
during  the company took delivery of barges with a total capacity of  barrels  three horsepower towboats and one horsepower towboat 
the new construction will consist of barges with a total capacity of  barrels and five horsepower towboats 
delivery is anticipated to be throughout and early 
table of contents the company s strong cash flow and unutilized loan facilities position the company to take advantage of internal and external growth opportunities in its marine transportation and diesel engine services segments 
the marine transportation segment s external growth opportunities include potential acquisitions of independent inland tank barge operators and captive fleet owners seeking to outsource tank barge requirements 
increasing the fleet size would allow the company to improve asset utilization through more backhaul opportunities  faster barge turnarounds  more efficient use of horsepower  barges positioned closer to cargoes  less cleaning due to operating more barges with compatible prior cargoes  lower incremental costs due to enhanced purchasing power and minimal incremental administrative staff 
the diesel engine services segment s external growth opportunities include further consolidation of strategically located diesel service providers  and expanded service capability for other engine and marine gear related products 
the company anticipates continued strong demand for the transportation services of the marine transportation segment in in and  some incremental capacity was added to the industry fleet and the company anticipates some additional capacity will be added during additionally  the company anticipates that the diesel engine services segment will continue to perform well  with strong service activity and direct parts sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  a significant change in the level of uncollectible amounts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
major maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 

table of contents in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this guidance prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in interim and annual financial reporting periods because an obligation has not occurred and therefore a liability should not be recognized 
the company adopted the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of the first quarter of this change was applied retrospectively for all consolidated financial statements presented 
the change had no impact on its annual consolidated financial statements but affected its interim consolidated financial statements 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company  or are not yet fully developed 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance
