item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
introduction the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein as item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
refer to forward looking statements on page and risk factors beginning on page  for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks  and assumptions associated with these statements 
overview we design  develop  produce and support a technologically advanced portfolio of small unmanned aircraft systems  or uas  that we supply primarily to organizations within the us department of defense  or dod  and fast charge systems for electric industrial vehicle batteries that we supply to commercial customers 
we derive the majority of our revenue from these two business areas and we believe that both the small unmanned aircraft systems  or uas  and fast charge markets are in the early stages of development and have significant growth potential 
additionally  we believe that some of the innovative potential products in our research and development pipeline will emerge as new growth platforms in the future  creating market opportunities 
the success we have achieved with our current products stems from our investment in research and development and our ability to invent and deliver advanced solutions  utilizing our proprietary technologies  to help our government and commercial customers operate more effectively and efficiently 
our core technological capabilities  developed through more than years of innovation  include lightweight aerostructures and electric propulsion systems  efficient electric energy systems and storage  high density energy packaging  miniaturization  controls integration and systems engineering optimization 
through our fiscal year ended april   we were organized into three segments based on our business operations  uas  posicharge systems  and energy technology center  which focused primarily on the development of innovative  efficient electric energy technologies for internal and external customers  and also developed  produced and supported a line of electronic test equipment used for research and development activities 
as of may   the operations of our posicharge systems and energy technology center were consolidated to form the newly named efficient energy systems segment 
revenue we generate our revenue primarily from the sale and support of our small uas and posicharge solutions 
support for our small uas customers includes training  spare parts  product repair  product replacement  and the customer contracted operation of our small uas by our personnel 
we refer to these support activities collectively as our services operation 
we derive most of our small uas revenue from fixed price and cost plus fee contracts with the us government  and most of our posicharge revenue from sales and service to commercial customers 
we also generate revenue from our energy technology center through the provision of contract development and engineering services  the sale of our power processing systems and license fees 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of direct costs and allocated indirect costs 
direct costs include labor  materials  travel  subcontracts and other costs directly related to the execution of a specific contract 
indirect costs include overhead expenses  fringe benefits and other costs that are not directly charged to a specific contract 
gross margin gross margin is equal to revenue minus cost of sales 
we use gross margin as a financial metric to help us understand trends in our direct costs and allocated indirect costs when compared to the revenue we generate 
research and development expense research and development  or r d  is an integral part of our business model 
we conduct significant internally funded research and development and anticipate that research and development expense will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
our uas research and development activities focus specifically on creating capabilities that support our existing small uas product portfolio as well as new uas platforms 
these activities are funded both externally by customers and internally 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  include salaries and other expenses related to selling  marketing and proposal activities  and other administrative costs 
sg a is an important financial metric that we analyze to help us evaluate the contribution of our selling  marketing and proposal activities to revenue generation 
other income and expenses other income and expenses includes interest income and interest expense 
income tax expense our effective tax rates are substantially lower than the statutory rates primarily due to research and development tax credits and federal tax exempt municipal bond interest income 
the federal research and development tax credit expired in december critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical estimates include those related to revenue recognition  inventories and reserves for excess and obsolescence  self insured liabilities  accounting for stock based awards  and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our organization and significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
the substantial majority of our revenue is generated pursuant to written contractual arrangements to design  develop  manufacture and or modify complex products  and to provide related engineering  technical and other services according to customer specifications 
these contracts may be fixed price or cost reimbursable 
we consider all contracts for treatment in accordance with financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf eitf provides for deferral to higher authoritative guidance  including american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or sop  under which the majority of our contracts are properly accounted for 
contracts which provide for multiple deliverables to which sop does not apply are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of eitf revenue from product sales not under contractual arrangement is recognized at the time title and the risk and rewards of ownership pass  which typically occurs when the products are shipped and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue and profits on fixed price contracts are recognized using percentage of completion methods of accounting 
revenue and profits on fixed price production contracts  whose units are produced and delivered in a continuous or sequential process  are recorded as units are delivered based on their selling prices  or the units of delivery method 
revenue and profits on other fixed price contracts with significant engineering as well as production requirements are recorded based on the ratio of total actual incurred costs to date to the total estimated costs for each contract  or the cost to cost method 
under percentage of completion methods of accounting  a single estimated total profit margin is used to recognize profit for each contract over its entire period of performance  which can exceed one year 
accounting for revenue and profits on a fixed price contract requires the preparation of estimates of the total contract revenue  the total costs at completion  which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s statement of work and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss at completion on a contract is equal to the difference between the total estimated contract revenue and the total estimated cost at completion 
under the units of delivery method  sales on a fixed price type contract are recorded as the units are delivered during the period based on their contractual selling prices 
under the cost to cost method  sales on a fixed price type contract are recorded at amounts equal to the ratio of actual cumulative costs incurred divided by total estimated costs at completion  multiplied by a the total estimated contract revenue  less b the cumulative sales recognized in prior periods 
the profit recorded on a contract in any period using either the units of delivery method or cost to cost method is equal to x the current estimated total profit margin multiplied by the cumulative sales recognized  less y the amount of cumulative profit previously recorded for the contract 
in the case of a contract for which the total estimated costs exceed the total estimated revenue  a loss arises  and a provision for the entire loss is recorded in the period that it becomes evident 
the unrecoverable costs on a loss contract that are expected to be incurred in future periods are recorded in the program cost 
revenue and profits on cost reimbursable type contracts are recognized as costs are incurred on the contract  at an amount equal to the costs plus the estimated profit on those costs 
the estimated profit on a cost reimbursable contract is generally fixed or variable based on the contractual fee arrangement 
we review cost performance and estimates to complete at least quarterly and in many cases more frequently 
adjustments to original estimates for a contract s revenue  estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
the impact of revisions in profit estimates for all types of contracts are recognized on a cumulative catch up basis in the period in which the revisions are made 
amounts representing contract change orders or claims are included in revenue only when they can be reliably estimated and their realization is probable 
incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
revenue on arrangements that are not within the scope of sop is recognized in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
inventories and reserve for excess and obsolescence our policy for valuation of inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write downs if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
supplemental executive retirement plan obligation we maintained a supplemental executive retirement plan  or serp  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for dr 
maccready  our late founder and former chairman of our board of directors until january  the plan was non contributory and non funded 
pension expense was determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to the plan beneficiary  and this amount was accrued as a liability on our balance sheet until termination of the serp 
we reviewed the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs annually 
in january  the serp terminated without any payment or promise of future payment to dr 
maccready  which resulted in a reversal of the related accrued expense of approximately million for the fiscal year ended april  self insured liability we are self insured for employee medical claims  subject to individual and aggregate stop loss policies 
we estimate a liability for claims filed and incurred but not reported claims based upon recent claims experience and an analysis of the average period of time between the occurrence of a claim and the time it is reported to and paid by us 
we perform an annual evaluation of this policy and have determined that for all prior years during which this policy has been in effect there have been cost advantages to this policy  as compared to obtaining commercially available employee medical insurance 
however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes  which includes estimating our current income taxes as well as measuring the temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we currently have significant deferred assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends on our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors  which may result in recording a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
fiscal periods our fiscal year ends on april due to our fixed year end date of april  our first and fourth quarters each consist of approximately weeks 
the second and third quarters each consist of weeks 
our first three quarters end on a saturday

without the reversal  sg a expense increased million  primarily due to higher selling and marketing infrastructure associated with business growth and added expense for being a public company 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to for the fiscal year ended april  this decrease was largely due to higher levels of tax exempt interest income received from our short term investments

revenue for the fiscal year ended april  was million  as compared to million for the fiscal year ended april   representing an increase of million  or 
uas revenue increased million to million for the fiscal year ended april   largely due to increases in uas product sales  services and customer funded r d 
the increase in product sales resulted from higher manufacturing volume associated with our progression to full rate production resulting from the completion of customer testing and evaluation of our raven b product 
posicharge systems revenue decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended april   primarily due to a reduction in installations of our posicharge systems products among automotive customers 
energy technology center revenue increased by million to million in the fiscal year ended april   primarily due to higher sales of power processing test equipment

r d expense for the fiscal year ended april  was million  or of revenue  which was lower than r d expense of million  or of revenue  for the fiscal year ended april  primarily due to a shift of engineering resources to customer funded r d work 
customer funded r d work for the fiscal year ended april  increased million  or  to million 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expense for the fiscal year ended april  was million  or of revenue  which included the reversal of expenses associated with the serp of million 
excluding the effect of the serp on sg a for both fiscal years  sg a expense increased to million  or of revenue for our fiscal year ended april   compared to sg a expense of million  or of revenue  in the fiscal year ended april  the increase in sg a expense of million was caused primarily by the addition of administrative and marketing infrastructure necessary to continue to grow our business 
income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended april   as compared to for the fiscal year ended april  this increase was largely due to lower federal research and development tax credits as a percentage of revenue 
liquidity and capital resources we currently have no material cash commitments  except for normal recurring trade payables  accrued expenses and ongoing research and development costs  all of which we anticipate funding through our existing working capital  funds provided by operating activities 
the majority of our purchase obligations are pursuant to funded contractual arrangements with our customers 
in addition  we do not currently anticipate significant investment in property  plant and equipment  and we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities and other financing sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements  if any  during the next twelve months 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will continue to generate cash flow at current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  then we may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures or obtain additional financing 
our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital  investing in capital expenditures  supporting product development efforts  introducing new products and enhancing existing products  and marketing acceptance and adoption of our products and services 
our future capital requirements  to a certain extent  are also subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense industry and are subject to general economic  political  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors that are beyond our control 
moreover  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalents  cash from operations  and cash from short term borrowing are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investment in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
our working capital requirements vary by contract type 
on cost plus fee programs  we typically bill our incurred costs and fees monthly as work progresses  and therefore working capital investment is minimal 
on fixed price contracts  we typically are paid as we deliver products  and working capital is needed to fund labor and expenses incurred during the lead time from contract award until contract deliveries begin 
cash flows the following table provides our cash flow data as of fiscal year ended april  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash provided by used in investing activities  net cash provided by used in financing activities  cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended april  increased by million to million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to an increase in tax benefits from stock options exercises of million  the reversal of the supplemental executive retirement plan accrual in the prior year of million  higher depreciation and amortization expense of million  and higher net income of million partially offset by higher working capital needs of million and higher deferred income taxes of million 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended april  increased by million to million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  this increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income of million  lower deferred taxes of million  and higher depreciation costs of million partially offset by increased working capital needs of million and the reversal of the prior year serp of million 
cash provided by investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities increased by million to million for the fiscal year ended april   compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  the increase in net cash provided by investing activities was primarily due to net redemption of tax exempt municipal auction rate securities of million partially offset by higher capital expenditures of million 
during the fiscal year ended april  and april   we used cash to purchase property and equipment totaling million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the fiscal year ended april   compared to million for the fiscal year ended april  during the fiscal year ended april   we invested cash in tax exempt municipal securities totaling million 
during the fiscal year ended april  and april   we used cash to purchase property and equipment totaling million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million for the fiscal year ended april   compared to million for the fiscal year ended april  on january   we completed an initial public offering that provided net proceeds of million 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended april  and april   we received proceeds from stock option exercises of million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities increased million to million for the fiscal year ended april   compared to net cash used by financing activities of million for the fiscal year ended april  during the fiscal year ended april   we received net proceeds from our initial public offering of million 
long term debt payments  net of borrowings  during the fiscal year ended april  decreased by million  compared to the fiscal year ended april  in addition  we fulfilled the delivery terms outlined in a standby letter of credit that allowed us to release million of restricted cash 
line of credit and term loan facilities we had a revolving line of credit with a bank  under which we were able to borrow up to million 
borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime commercial lending rate  which was as of april  the line of credit was secured by substantially all of our assets 
all principal plus accrued but unpaid interest on the line of credit would have been due august  we had no outstanding balance on the line of credit as of april  effective june   we cancelled the line of credit with the bank to avoid unused commitment fees 
contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of april  payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations     purchase obligations   total     consists of all cancelable and non cancelable purchase orders as of april  we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements and bank guarantee agreements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services and to secure advance payments we have received from certain international customers 
as of april  and  we had standby letters of credit totaling and  respectively  without any claims against such letters of credit 
these letters of credit expired upon release by the customer 
off balance sheet arrangements as of april   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the sec s regulation s k 
inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in our material and labor costs
