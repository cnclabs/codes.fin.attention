item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview national healthcare corporation  which we also refer to as nhc or the company  is a leading provider of long term health care services 
at december   we operate or manage long term health care centers with  beds in states and provide other services in two additional states 
these operations are provided by separately funded and maintained subsidiaries 
we provide long term health care services to patients in a variety of settings including long term nursing centers  managed care specialty units  sub acute care units  alzheimer s care units  hospice care  homecare programs  assisted living centers and independent living centers 
in addition  we provide management and accounting services to owners of long term health care centers 
executive summary merger of national healthcare corporation and national health realty  inc  and issuance of nhc convertible preferred stock on october   nhc completed its acquisition of national health realty  inc  nhr as contemplated by the agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement  dated december   by and among davis acquisition sub llc  nhc op  lp  nhr and nhc  following the approval of the merger by the stockholders of nhr and the adoption of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation of nhc and approval of the issuance of shares of nhc series a convertible preferred stock nhc preferred by the stockholders of nhc 
the acquisition is expected to enable us to move forward with future growth opportunities  to enhance our cash flows  and to provide us with ownership of a portfolio of first class health care  retirement and assisted living centers 
we estimate that we experienced a reduction in earnings per share of approximately cents per share basic and one cent per share diluted due to the merger 
we believe  however  that the negative consequence is offset by the accretive effect that the merger has had and is expected to have in the future on nhc s free cash flow 
 revolving credit agreement on october   national healthcare corporation entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with bank of america  na  as lender the lender 
the credit agreement provides for a  revolving credit facility the credit facility  of which of up to  may be utilized for letters of credit 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at either i the eurodollar rate plus or ii the base rate 
the credit facility is available for general corporate purposes  including working capital and acquisitions 
we obtained the line of credit to fund further growth strategies as opportunities arise 
earnings to monitor our earnings  we have developed budgets and management reports to monitor labor  census  and the composition of revenues 
inflationary increases in our costs may cause net earnings from patient services to decline 
development and growth we are undertaking to expand our long term care operations while protecting our existing operations and markets 
the following table lists our recent or expected construction and purchase activities 
description beds location placed in service ps or began construction bc purchase town country  mo march ps addition farragut  tn third quarter ps addition mauldin  sc third quarter ps addition columbia  sc first quarter ps addition garden city  sc first quarter ps addition north augusta  sc second quarter bc addition franklin  tn ps new center bluffton  sc bc purchase knoxville  tn january ps in april  we purchased long term health care beds and received certificate of need approval for an additional beds to construct a new bed facility to be located in hendersonville  tennessee 
construction of the new facility is expected to begin in in we are continuing to develop an active hospice program in south carolina independently of our partnership with caris healthcare and are also exploring opportunities to expand our home health care services 
also during  we will apply for certificates of need for additional beds in our markets and also evaluate the feasibility of expansion into new markets by building private pay health care centers or by the purchase of existing health care centers 
accrued risk reserves our accrued professional liability reserves  workers compensation reserves and health insurance reserves totaled  at december  and are a primary area of management focus 
we have set aside restricted cash and marketable securities to fund our professional liability and workers compensation reserves 
as to exposure for professional liability claims  we have developed for our centers performance certification criteria to measure and bring focus to the patient care issues most likely to produce professional liability exposure  including in house acquired pressure ulcers  significant weight loss and numbers of falls 
these programs for certification  which we regularly modify and improve  have produced measurable improvements in reducing these incidents 
our experience is that achieving goals in these patient care areas improves both patient and employee satisfaction 
furthermore  we are continuing efforts to identify and restructure the ownership or management of our higher risk operations and locations to eliminate nhc liability exposure 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
our critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments are as follows revenue recognition third party payors approximately  and and of our net revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
we have made provisions of approximately  for other various medicare and medicaid issues for current and prior year cost reports 
consistent with our revenue recognition policies  we will record revenues associated with the approved requests and the other various issues when the approvals  including the final cost report audits  are assured 
we recorded revenues of  and a  for suc h settlements in and  respectively 
adjustments of a similar nature were not significant in revenue recognition private pay for private pay patients in skilled nursing or assisted living facilities  we bill room and board in advance for the current month with payment being due upon receipt of the statement in the month the services are performed 
charges for ancillary  pharmacy  therapy and other services to private patients are billed in the month following the performance of services  however  all billings are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
valuations and impairments to our investment in enhanced cash fund at december   we reported an aggregate investment of  in the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund the fund which invests principally in high quality corporate debt  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities 
during december  the fund s manager notified us that due to turmoil in credit markets in the united states fund cash redemptions to investors were suspended  the fund s valuation will be based on the market value of the underlying securities instead of amortized cost  interest would continue to accrue and be paid and the fund would begin an orderly liquidation and dissolution of its assets for distribution to the fund holders that is expected to be completed in as the fund is liquidated  we expect to receive our pro rata share of the fund in cash distributions 
nb sp  the fund s valuation will fluctuate based on changes in the market values of the securities held by the fund 
at december  we adjusted our carrying value to the fund s net asset value  which adjustment required us to write down our carrying value by  we will continue to evaluate our investment in the fund for other than temporary impairments 
it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to our estimates of the fund value 
accrued risk reserves we are principally self insured for risks related to employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
our accrued risk reserves primarily represent the accrual for self insured risks associated with employee health insurance  workers compensation and professional and general liability claims 
the accrued risk reserves include a liability for reported claims and estimates for incurred but unreported claims 
our policy with respect to a significant portion of our workers compensation and professional and general liability claims is to use an actuary to support the estimates recorded for incurred but unreported claims 
our health insurance reserve is based on our known claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but unreported claims determined by our analysis of historical claims paid 
we reassess our accrued risk reserves on a quarterly basis 
professional liability remains an area of particular concern to us 
the entire long term care industry has seen a dramatic increase in personal injury wrongful death claims based on alleged negligence by nursing homes and their employees in providing care to residents 
as of december   we and or our managed centers are defendants in such claims inclusive of years through it remains possible that those pending matters plus potential unasserted claims could exceed our reserves  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
it is also possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these reserve estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we maintain insurance coverage for incidents occurring in all provider locations owned  leased or managed by us 
the coverages include both primary policies and umbrella policies 
for  we maintain primary coverage through our own insurance company with excess coverage provided by a third party insurance company 
for  we maintain both primary and excess coverage through our own insurance subsidiary 
in all years  settlements  if any  in excess of available insurance policy limits and our own reserves would be expensed by us 
revenue recognition subordination of fees and uncertain collections we provide management services to certain long term care facilities and to others we provide accounting and financial services 
we generally charge of net revenues for our management services and a predetermined fixed rate per bed for the accounting and financial services 
our policy is to recognize revenues associated with both management services and accounting and financial services on an accrual basis as the services are provided 
however  under the terms of our management contracts  payments for our management services are subject to subordination to other expenditures of the long term care center being managed 
furthermore  there are certain of the third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services and which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that collection i s not reasonably assured and our policy is to recognize income only in the period in which the amounts are realized 
we may receive payment for the unpaid and unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investing activities of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees 
there can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur 
the realization of such previously unrecognized revenue could cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
we agree to subordinate our fees to the other expenses of a managed center because we believe we know how to improve the quality of patient services and finances of a long term care center and because subordinating our fees demonstrates to the owner and employees of the managed center how confident we are of the impact we can have in making the center operations successful 
we may continue to provide services to certain managed centers despite not being fully paid currently so that we may be able to collect unpaid fees in the future from improved operating results and because the incremental savings from discontinuing services to a center may be small compared to the potential benefit 
also  we may benefit from providing other ancillary services to the managed center 
we may receive payment for the unrecognized management fees in whole or in part in the future only if cash flows from the operating and investment activities of the centers are sufficient to pay the fees 
there can be no assurance that such future cash flows will occur 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements regarding our relationships with national  nhi and centers previously owned by nhi and the recognition of management fees from long term care centers owned by these parties 
certain of our accounts receivable from private paying patients and certain of our notes receivable are subject to credit losses 
we have attempted to reserve for expected accounts receivable credit losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
we continually monitor and evaluate the carrying amount of our notes receivable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 aaccounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and it is possible  however  that the accuracy of our estimation process could be materially impacted as the composition of the receivables changes over time 
we continually review and refine our estimation process to make it as reactive to these changes as possible 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accurately estimate credit losses on these balances 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
potential recognition of deferred income during  we sold the assets of eight long term health care centers to national health corporation anational  our administrative general partner at the time of the sale 
the resulting profit of  was deferred 
 of the deferred gain and related deferred income taxes of  was recognized as income in december  with the collection of the  note from national 
 of the deferred gain has been amortized into income on a straight line basis over the year management contract period 
additional deferred income of  will be reported when the company no longer has an obligation to advance the  working capital loan which obligation was extended until january  with the extension of the management agreement with national to th at date 
guarantees we guarantee the debt of national and the esop 
it is possible that future events could cause us to make adjustments to our estimates and liability under this guarantee and cause our reported net income to vary from period to period 
uncertain tax positions nhc continually evaluates for uncertain tax positions 
these uncertain positions may arise where tax laws may allow for alternative interpretations or where the timing of recognition of income is subject to judgment 
we believe we have adequate provisions for our uncertain tax positions including related penalties and interest 
however  because of uncertainty of interpretation by various tax authorities and the possibility that there are issues that have not been recognized by management  we cannot guarantee we have accurately estimated our tax liabilities 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with limited need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles

the overall average census in owned and leased health care centers for was compared to in and in approximately and and of our net patient revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
as discussed above in the application of critical accounting policies section  amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the medicare and medicaid intermediaries 
see application of critical accounting policies for discussion of the effects that this revenue concentration and the uncertainties related to such revenues have on our revenue recognition policies 
government program financial changes cost containment will continue to be a priority for federal and state governments for health care services  including the types of services we provide 
government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid prescribe  by law  the billing methods and amounts that health care providers may charge and be reimbursed to care for patients covered by these programs 
congress has passed a number of laws that have effected major changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
the balanced budget act of  or the budget act  sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  reducing federal spending on medicare and medicaid to various providers 
in february  congress enacted the deficit reduction act  or dra  which reduced net medicare and medicaid spending  and in december  congress passed the tax relief and health care act of  which also affects payments under the medicare and medicaid programs 
in the tax relief and health care act of  congress reduced the limit on medicaid provider taxes for the period january  through september  from the percent set by cms regulations to a percent limit set by statute 
medicare effective october   our pps rates were increased by due to inflation update and care based statistical area cbsa designations 
we estimate that the positive revenue effect of the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms final rule was  for the fourth quarter of the inflation update or market basket increase was in and in overall our average medicare per diem increased in compared to no assurances can be given as to whether congress will increase or decrease reimbursement in the future  the timing of any action or the form of relief  if any  that may be enacted 
medicaid tennessee annual medicaid rate increases were implemented effective july  the increase in revenue was approximately  per quarter 
minimum wage pass thru impact was  per quarter 
missouri medicaid funded a global rate increase for all providers of per day effective for february  through june  effective july   an additional per day increase was funded 
the combined effect of the eleven months in rate increases was approximately  in south carolina medicaid annual per diem rate increases resulted in additional revenues of approximately  per quarter 
overall our average medicaid per diem increased in compared to we face challenges with respect to states medicaid payments  because many currently do not cover the total costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
states will continue to control medicaid expenditures but also look for adequate funding sources  including provider assessments 
the dra includes several provisions designed to reduce medicaid spending 
these provisions include  among others  provisions strengthening the medicaid asset transfer restrictions for persons seeking to qualify for medicaid long term care coverage  which could  due to the timing of the penalty period  increase facilities exposure to uncompensated care 
other provisions could increase state funding for home and community based services  potentially having an impact on funding for nursing facilities 
there is no assurance that the funding for our services will increase or decrease in the future 
compared to results for compared to include a increase in net revenues and a increase in net income before income taxes after excluding the consideration of the effect of the recovery of a note receivable previously written off 
net patient revenues increased  or compared to the same period last year due to government and program and private pay rate increases and bed additions

other revenues this year decreased  or to  other revenues in include management and accounting service fees of   in and insurance services revenue of   in

the increases were offset by increases in accounts receivable and increases in restricted cash 
increases in restricted cash totaled  compared to an increase of  in the prior year 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to increases in revenues and timing differences 
the increase in restricted cash is due primarily to the cash reserved for our accrued risk reserves  including professional liability claims  workers compensation claims and health insurance claims  net of cash paid out for those claims 
the increase in other current liabilities and accrued risks reserves accounted for  in   in and  in of the cash provided by operating activities

investment in enhanced cash fund at december   we reported an aggregate investment of  in the columbia strategic cash portfolio fund the fund in current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fund invests in obligations denominated in us dollars consisting of asset backed securities  corporate bonds and notes  certificates of deposit  short term corporate debt obligations  commercial paper  extendible commercial notes  and municipal bonds 
we have invested in the fund for a number of years and prior to december   we had considered the investment to be a cash equivalent because the funds were immediately available for distribution 
by a series of notices from december  through december   the fund s manager notified us that cash redemptions were suspended  although redemptions could under certain circumstances be fulfilled through a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities  the fund s valuation will be based on the market value of the underlying securities  whereas historically the fund s valuation was based on amortized cost  interest would continue to accrue  and the fund would begin an orderly liquidation and dissolution of its assets for distribution to the fund holders that is expected to be completed in our investment in the fund of  at december  is not considered a cash equivalent due to the suspension of fund redemptions 
at december   our aggregate investment in the fund was  which amount was included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets 
as the fund is liquidated  we expect to receive our pro rata share of the fund in cash distributions 
the fund has begun making distributions 
we received  of cash distributions in december  and  in january  in that time period  the fund has reported  of realized losses  of which amount  was reported in the fund s valuation will fluctuate based on changes in the market values of the securities held by the fund 
at december   we adjusted our carrying value to the fund s net asset value  which adjustment required us to write down our carrying value through a charge to earnings by  because the fund is invested in financial instruments with exposure to the current turmoil in the credit markets in the united states  we consider the write down amount to be an other than temporary impairment 
it is difficult to predict the timing or magnitude of these other than temporary impairments and additional impairments may occur 
management does not expect that the current illiquidity of the fund will prevent us from meeting our obligations as they come due or from making new investments when and as opportunities arise 
table of contractual cash obligations our contractual cash obligations for periods subsequent to december  are as follows in s total less than year years years after years long term debt principal long term debt interest obligations to complete construction obligation to purchase senior secured notes from financial institutions operating leases total contractual cash obligations we have guaranteed debt obligations of certain other entities totaling approximately  these guarantees are not included in the table above because we do not anticipate material obligations under these commitments 
nhc has entered into agreements to complete construction of leasehold improvements at three long term health care facilities 
at december   we are obligated on construction contracts in the amount of approximately  income taxes payable for uncertain tax positions under fin of  attributable to permanent differences  at december  has not been included in the above table because of the inability to estimate the period in which it is expected to occur 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
our current cash on hand  marketable securities  short term notes receivable  operating cash flows  and as needed  our borrowing capacity are expected to be adequate to meet these contractual obligations and to finance our operating requirements  growth and development plans 
we started paying quarterly dividends in the second quarter of and anticipate the continuation of dividend payments as approved quarterly by the board of directors 
in addition to our primary debt obligations  which are included in our consolidated financial statements  we have guaranteed certain of the debt obligations of national and the esop 
this guarantee  which is not included as debt obligations in our consolidated financial statements  totals  at december  the  of guarantees of debt of national and the esop relates to senior secured notes held by financial institutions 
the total outstanding balance of national and the esop s obligations under these senior secured notes is  of this obligation   has been included in our debt obligations because we are a direct obligor on this indebtedness 
the remaining  which is not included in our debt obligations because we are not a direct obligor  is due from nhi to national and the esop 
the  of senior secured notes payable and the  guarantee described above have cross default provisions with other debt of national and the esop 
we currently believe that national and the esop are in compliance with the terms of their debt agreements 
as of december   our maximum potential loss related to debt guarantees and financial guarantees is  we have no outstanding letters of credit 
we may or may not in the future elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure in the future 
at december   we did not participate in any such financial investments 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of new accounting standards 
impact of inflation inflation has remained relatively low during the past three years 
however  rates paid under the medicare and medicaid programs do not necessarily reflect all inflationary changes and are subject to cuts unrelated to inflationary costs 
therefore  there can be no assurance that future rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases in our labor and other health care service costs 
recently passed minimum wage increases are not expected to have a material impact on salaries and wages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months when purchased 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have minimal impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as the interest rates on these notes receivable are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
approximately million of our notes receivable bear interest at variable rates generally at the prime rate plus 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in a related increase or decrease in interest income of approximately  as of december   none of our long term debt bears interest at fixed interest rates 
all of our long term debt million at december  bears interest at variable rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in a related increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately  we do not currently use any derivative instruments to hedge our interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of such instruments in the future would be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
equity price risk we consider the majority of our investments in marketable securities as available for sale securities and unrealized gains and losses that are not considered to be other than temporary are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 aaccounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
hypothetically  a increase in quoted market prices would result in a related increase in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities of  and a reduction in quoted market prices would result in a related decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities of approximately
