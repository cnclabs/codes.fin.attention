item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an insurance holding company engaged in the insurance and reinsurance business through our wholly owned insurance company  independence american insurance company independence american and our marketing organizations  including our three medical stop loss managing general underwriter subsidiaries our mgus 
since november  amic has been affiliated with independence holding company ihc  which currently owns of amic s stock  and ihc s senior management has provided direction to the company through service agreements between the company and ihc 
in  independence american s primary source of revenue was reinsurance premiums 
the majority of these premiums are ceded to independence american from ihc under long term reinsurance treaties to cede its gross medical stop loss premiums written to independence american 
in addition  independence american as sumes fully insured health and short term statutory disability benefit product in new york state dbl premiums from ihc  and assumes medical stop loss premiums from unaffiliated carriers 
in  independence american began writing small group major medical  medical stop loss  major medical plans for individuals and families  and short term medical 
given its enhanced a excellent rating from am best  independence american expects to expand the distribution of its medical stop loss products through our mgus  and increase significantly the business written on its paper  especially major medical plans for individuals and families 
while management considers a wide range of factors in its strategic planning  the overriding consideration is underwriting profitability 
management s assessment of trends in healthcare and in the medical stop loss market play a significant role in determining whether to expand independence american s reinsurance participation percentage or the number of programs it reinsures 
since independence american reinsures a portion of all of the business produced by our mgus  and since these companies are also eligible to earn profit sharing commissions based on the profitability of the business they place  our mgus also emphasize underwriting profitability 
in addition  management focuses on controlling operating costs 
by sharing employees with ihc and sharing resources among our subsidiaries  we strive to maximize our earnings

the return on investments of the company was for both and independence american insurance company in the fourth quarter of  independence american s rating by am best company was upgraded to a excellent 
our results were negatively impacted by higher than expected claims from certain of independence american s medical stop loss programs 
o income loss before income taxes from the medical stop loss portion of the independence american segment decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily as a result of a million charge in relating to the re estimation of insurance reserves from the prior year in addition to an increase in the rate that the company is reserving for current year business as more fully described in the reserve strengthening discussion under results of operations for the year ended december  the average percentage of gross medical stop loss premiums written ceded from ihc to independence american slightly increased to during from during premiums earned increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended  primarily due to the company s agreement with employers direct health edh see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and the increase in fully insured health premiums assumed from ihc 
for the year ended december   independence american wrote million of medical stop loss business and million of small group major medical business pursuant to the agreement with the aforementioned production source 
for the year ended december   independence american wrote million of medical stop loss business and of small group major medical business under the same agreement 
independence american added three additional licenses in  bringing its total to states and the district of columbia 
in  independence american began writing health plans for individuals and families through a national  career agent marketing organization 
underwriting experience  as indicated by its gaap combined ratios on the three lines of business within the independence american segment  are as follows medical stop loss in thousands premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves expenses loss ratio a expense ratio b combined ratio c fully insured health in thousands premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves expenses loss ratio a expense ratio b combined ratio c dbl in thousands premiums earned insurance benefits claims and reserves expenses loss ratio a expense ratio b combined ratio c a loss ratio represents insurance benefits claims and reserves divided by premiums earned 
b expense ratio represents net commissions  administrative fees  premium taxes and other underwriting expenses divided by premiums earned 
c the combined ratio is equal to the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio 
mgu subsidiaries independencecare  marlton  ras in  our mgus wrote an aggregate of million of annualized gross premium which generated pre tax income of million  as compared to million and million in  respectively 
our mgus wrote less premiums due  in part  to stricter underwriting guidelines and the continuing generally soft market 
pre tax income increased primarily due to an increase in profit commissions and a decrease in operating expenses 
in  our mgus generated revenues of million  as compared to million in  a decrease of  due to the lower volume of premium underwritten 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies and practices is provided in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements and this management s discussion and analysis 
insurance reserves the company maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  where material  including legal and other fees  for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these loss reserves are based on actuarial assumptions and are maintained at levels that are estimated in accordance with gaap 
the company s estimate of loss reserves represents management s best estimate of the company s liability at the balance sheet date 
all of the company s policies are short duration and are accounted for based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss inherent in that period s claims or open claims from prior periods  including losses incurred for claims that have not been reported ibnr 
short duration contract loss estimates rely on actuarial observations of ultimate loss experience for similar historical events 
management believes that the company s methods of estimating the liabilities for insurance reserves provided appropriate levels of reserves at december  changes in the company s reserve estimates are recorded through a charge or credit to its earnings 
medical stop loss the company s medical stop loss business is comprised of employer stop loss  hmo reinsurance and provider excess 
the two primary or key assumptions underlying the calculation of loss reserves for medical stop loss business are i projected net loss ratio  and ii claim development patterns 
the projected net loss ratio is set at expected levels consistent with the underlying assumptions projected net loss ratio 
claim development patterns are set quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history claim development patterns 
the company uses the projected net loss ratio to establish reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
the company has concluded that a reasonably likely change in the projected net l oss ratio assumption could have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity material effect but a reasonably likely change in the claim development pattern would not have a material effect 
projected net loss ratio generally  during the first twelve months of an underwriting year  reserves for medical stop loss are first set at the projected net loss ratio  which is determined using assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward 
the projected net loss ratio is the company s best estimate of future performance until such time as developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results 
while the company establishes a best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  actual experience may deviate from this estimate 
this was the case with the  and underwriting years which deviated by  and net loss ratio points  respectively 
after the recorded reserve increase it is reasonably likely that the actual experience will fall within a range up to five net loss ratio points above or below the expected projected net loss ratio for at december  the impact of these reasonably likely changes at december   would be an increase in net reserves in the case of a higher ratio or a decrease in net reserves in the case of a lower ratio of up to approximately million with a corresponding increase or decrease in the pre tax expense for insurance benefits  claims and reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
major factors that affect the projected net loss ratio assumption in reserving for medical stop loss relate to i frequency and severity of claims  ii changes in medical trend resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation  changes in utilization and demand for medical services  the impact of new medical technology and changes in medical treatment protocols  and iii the adherence by the mgus that produce and administer this business to applicable underwriting guidelines 
changes in these underlying factors are what determine the reasonably likely changes in the projected net loss ratio as discussed above 
claim development patterns subsequent to the first twelve months of an underwriting year  the company s developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate losses 
at this point  claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
development factors based on historical patterns are applied to paid and reported claims to estimate fully developed claims 
claim development patterns are reviewed quarterly as reserve estimates are developed and are based on recent claim development history 
the company must determine whether changes in development represent true indications of emerging experience or are simply due to random claim fluctuations 
the company also establishes its best estimates of claim development factors to be applied to more developed treaty year experience 
while these factors are based on historical claim development patterns  actual claim development may vary from these estimates 
the company does not believe that reasonably likely changes in its actual claim development patterns would have a material effect 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is more complex than fully insured medical and disability business due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
the level of these deductibles makes it more difficult to predict the amount and payment pattern of such claims 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims  whereas fluctuations in aggregate coverage are largely attributable to frequency of underlying claims rather than severity 
liabilities for first dollar medical reserves and disability coverages are computed using completion factors and expected loss ratios derived from actual historical premium and claim data 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies or deficiencies will typically emerge during the course of the following year rather than over a number of years 
for employer stop loss  as noted above  the company maintains its reserves based on underlying assumptions until it determines that an adjustment is appropriate based on emerging experience from all of its mgus for prior underwriting years 
reserves for hmo reinsurance and provider excess are adjusted on a policy by policy basis 
because of the small number of hmo reinsurance and provider excess policies it writes  the company is able to evaluate each policy individually for potential liability by reviewing open claims with each hmo or provider group and applying completion factors using historical data 
fully insured health reserves for fully insured medical and dental business are established using historical claim development patterns 
claim development by number of months elapsed from the incurred month is studied each month and development factors are calculated 
these claim development factors are then applied to the amount of claims paid to date for each incurred month to estimate fully complete claims 
the difference between fully complete claims and the claims paid to date is the estimated reserve 
total reserves are the sum of the reserves for all incurred months 
the primary assumption in the determination of fully insured health reserves is that historical claim development patterns are representative of future claim development patterns 
factors which may affect this assumption include changes in claim payment processing times and procedures  changes in product design  changes in time delay in submission of claims and the incidence of unusually large claims 
the reserving analysis includes a review of claim processing statistical measures and large claim early notifications  the potential impact of any changes in these factors are minimal 
the time delay in submission of claims tends to be stable over time and not subject to significant volatility 
since our analysis considered a variety of outcomes related to these factors  the company does not believe that any reasonably likely change in these factors will have a material effect 
premium and mgu fee income revenue recognition direct and assumed premiums from short duration contracts are recognized as revenue over the period of the contracts in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
the company records mgu fee income as policy premium payments are earned 
our mgus are compensated in two ways 
they earn fee income based on the volume of business produced  and collect profit sharing commissions if such business exceeds certain profitability benchmarks 
profit sharing commissions are accounted for beginning in the period in which the company believes they are reasonably estimable  which is typically at the point that claims have developed to a level where claim development patterns can be applied to generate reasonably reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels 
reinsurance in  independence american derived most of its business from pro rata quota share reinsurance treaties with standard security life and madison national life  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of ihc 
these treaties were entered into in and terminate on december   unless terminated sooner by independence american 
standard security life and madison national life must cede at least of their medical stop loss business to independence american under these treaties 
additionally  standard security life  madison national life and independence american have received regulatory approval to cede up to to independence american under most of ihc s medical stop loss programs 
for the twelve months ended december  and  standard security life and madison national life ceded an average of and  respectively  of their medical stop loss business to independence american 
commencin g in july  independence american began reinsuring of standard security life s short term statutory disability benefit product dbl business 
in  standard security life and madison national life began ceding of the majority of its fully insured health business to independence american 
ihc provides the company with pro rata quota share reinsurance on business written by independence american 
commencing in january  independence american began ceding of its provider excess insurance to madison national life 
in january  independence american increased the amount ceded to madison national life to 
this treaty was entered into on january  and will remain in force for an indefinite period  unless terminated by either party as of any december the company is not aware of any regulatory or other restrictions on the ability of ihc to fund its obligations under agreements in which ihc reinsures such provider excess business 
any such restrictions would at this point have a minimal impact on the company 
in addition  in  independence american ceded of its short term medical stm and major medical for individuals and families business to unrelated reinsurers 
income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management believes that although sufficient uncertainty exists regarding the future realization of deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance has been adjusted to account for the expected utilization of net operating losses against future taxable income 
the company has net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire between and us federal and california tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
investments the company accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities under sfas no 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company has classified all of its investments as available for sale or trading securities 
these investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices with unrealized gains and losses reported in either accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets for available for sale securities or as unrealized gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations for trading securities 
fixed maturities and equity securities available for sale totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
premiums and discounts on debt securities purchased at other than par value are amortized and accreted  respectively  to interest income in the consolidated statemen ts of operations  using the constant yield method over the period to maturity 
the company also had million and million  on average  in trading accounts during december  and  respectively 
all such trading securities were liquidated at december  and net realized gains and losses on investments are computed using the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations 
declines in value of securities available for sale that are judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as net realized losses 
the factors considered by management in determining when a decline is other than temporary include but are not limited to the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in ratings announced by one or more rating agencies  whether the issuer of a debt security has remained current on principal and interest payments  whether the decline in fair value appears to be issuer specific or  alternatively  a reflection of general market or industry conditions including  in the case of fixed maturities  the effect of changes in market interest rates  and the company s intent and abili ty to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in fair value 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which consist of licenses  are not amortized but are tested for impairment  on a reporting unit basis  at the end of the third quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators arise 
the company defines its reporting units on a segment basis 
the company s other intangible assets consisting of broker third party relationships are amortized over five years 
discontinued operations the company accrued estimates of expected liabilities related to discontinued operations through its eventual discharge 
the estimated remaining liabilities related to discontinued operations include contract terminations  litigation and loss from operations subsequent to september  the company reviews the estimated closure costs liability on a quarterly basis to determine changes in the costs of the discontinued operations activities 
the cash flows used in discontinued operations are presented separately in the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows  there were no cash flows associated with investing and financing activities for the years presented for discontinued operations 
results of operations results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  net income 
the company s net income decreased to  or

premiums earned increased  or  to  for  compared to  for the company currently has three lines of business 
premiums relating to medical stop loss business were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in medical stop loss written by independence american as a result of the company s agreement with edh  an increase in medical stop loss premiums assumed by independence american  and a decrease in provider excess premiums written 
premiums relating to group medical  short term medical stm and individual health were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to production of group medical resulting from the company s agreement with edh  and an increase in premiums assumed from ihc 
premiums relating to dbl were  and  for and  respectively

mgu fee income 
mgu fee income decreased  to  for  compared to  for mgu fee income administration decreased  to  for  compared to  for  as our mgus have decreased their volume of business as a result of stricter underwriting guidelines 
mgu fee income profit commission increased  to  for  compared to  for from certain of our mgus that experienced loss ratios at a level that generated profit commissions 
profit commissions for a given year are primarily based on the performance of business written by an mgu during portions of the three preceding years 
therefore  profit commissions for are based on business written during portions of  and net investment income 
net investment income increased  to  for  compared to  for due to an increase in invested assets 
the return on investments of the company was for both and net realized investment gains loss 
net realized investment gains loss decreased  to a loss of  for  compared to a gain of  for the company s decision as to whether to sell securities is based on management s ongoing evaluation of investment opportunities and economic market conditions  thus creating fluctuations in realized gains or losses from period to period 
included in and is an unrealized loss of  and  respectively  representing an increase in the value of the derivative liability relating to the agreement with edh see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
for and  there were no losses on securities whose decline in value the company deemed to be other than temporary in nature 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
insurance benefits  claims and reserves 
insurance benefits claims and reserves increased  or  to  for  compared to  for the increase is mainly due to an increase in the volume of group medical written by independence american and assumed from ihc  an increase in the volume of medical stop loss  and the  strengthening of medical stop loss reserves as described below 
the increase of  for is comprised of a  increase in group medical and stm  a  increase in medical stop loss  and an increase of  relating to dbl 
reserve strengthening in accordance with our reserving methodology  the company initially establishes its medical stop loss reserves based on its best estimate of the projected net loss ratio  which is set based on underlying assumptions developed using completed prior experience trended forward projected net loss ratio 
this use of projections reflects the fact that actual claims on medical stop loss cases typically are not fully reported until after the end of the policy period 
we use the projected net loss ratio to set reserves until developing losses provide a better indication of ultimate results and it is feasible to set reserves based on claim development patterns 
amic s typical practice is to then increase or decrease claims reserves once we know the actual claims experience 
we then review quarterly the projected net loss ratios and claim development patterns as we develop reserve estimates based on recen t claim development history claim development patterns 
medical stop loss business is excess coverage with a short duration 
predicting ultimate claims and estimating reserves in medical stop loss is especially complicated due to the excess of loss nature of these products with very high deductibles applying to specific claims on any individual claimant and in the aggregate for a given group 
fluctuations in results for specific coverage are primarily due to the severity and frequency of individual claims 
due to the short term nature of medical stop loss  redundancies and deficiencies will typically emerge during the following year rather than over a number of years 
consistent with our experience  the industry as a whole has succumbed to the pricing pressures caused by an unexpectedly long down cycle or soft market for medical stop loss business 
the medical stop loss market has been soft for the past four years  including cases written in and  which means that many of the company s competitors have been willing to write business at little or no margin 
we had been aware of these market conditions and had curtailed our growth in order to attempt to achieve higher profit margins 
the company believed that it had taken sufficient action to insure that business written in would produce better margins than that written in and formulated a projected net loss ratio reflecting such expectations 
as is typical with medical stop loss business  mgus do have some discretion within our underwriting guidelines to make pricing concessions on certain cases  particularly as it relates to maintaining their core renewal business and production sources 
in the third quarter of  during our quarterly review of claim development patterns  we identified a material increase in claims and reserves with respect to business written in such adverse development was primarily driven by the frequency of claims relative to the business written in that year proving significantly higher than what would have been predicted by prior loss development patterns 
this increased frequency of medical stop loss claims was due  in part  to increased severity of primary claims 
the company determined that this increase in claims was an indication of a pattern of higher loss frequency 
while claims related to business written in had not yet developed to a level where claim development patterns would provide reliable estimates of ultimate claim levels  we determined that it was appropriate to re estimate the projected net loss ratio to take into account developing loss es with respect to business written in as a result of these actions  we increased the projected net loss ratio on the business written in by and increased the net loss ratio defined as insurance benefits  claims and reserves divided by premiums earned less underwriting expenses on the business written in by 
this resulted in a charge of  before income taxes  in relating to the re estimation of unpaid losses from the prior year and additional expense of  in related to the business 
the company recorded a net loss ratio for the medical stop loss line of and for the years ended december  and respectively 
the net loss ratio equation primarily differs from the combined ratio in that it subtracts out expenses from the premiums prior to dividing by the insurance benefits  claims and reserves 
we primarily use net loss ratio from a reserving standpoint and as a management to ol to measure the profitability of each medical stop loss program 
the company primarily uses combined ratio as an accounting measurement for reporting purposes 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to  for  compared to  for this increase is primarily due to higher commission expense of  incurred by independence american resulting from an increase in premiums written in the medical stop loss and fully insured health lines of business  slightly offset by minor reductions in other expenses 
amortization and depreciation 
amortization and depreciation expense increased  to  for  compared to  for the increased expense primarily relates to the amortization of the intangible asset representing the value of the company s agreement with edh see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  slightly offset by the decrease in amortization related to the value of broker tpa relationships of our mgus 
minority interest 
the company recorded  for and  for of expense related to the minority interest in marlton 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased  to  an effective rate of  for  compared to  an effective rate of  for net income for and includes a non cash provision for federal income taxes of  and  respectively 
the effective rate of for is lower than the same period in due to a tax benefit recognized in the current year from the true up of the september  tax provision to the fiscal september  tax return 
for as long as amic utilizes its net operating loss carry forwards  it will not pay any income taxes  except for federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes 
gain loss on discontinued operations 
loss on discontinued operations  net of tax was for  compared to  for the loss of  for was a result of unanticipated property taxes relating to intellicom 
for  the company has accrued for future property taxes relating to intellicom 
liquidity and capital resources independence american independence american principally derives cash flow from i operations  ii the receipt of scheduled principal payments on its portfolio of fixed income securities  and iii earnings on investments and other investing activities 
such cash flow is partially used to finance liabilities for insurance policy benefits and reinsurance obligations 
independence american maintains a  credit facility with a financial institution to support the issuance of standby letters of credit in connection with independence american s ordinary course of business 
this credit facility has never been drawn upon and there are no outstanding standby letters of credit under the facility 
the facility terminates on december   although  to the extent no standby letters of credit are outstanding  it may be reduced or cancelled by independence american at any time 
corporate corporate derives cash flow funds principally from dividends and tax payments from its subsidiaries and investment income from corporate liquidity 
there are no regulatory constraints on our mgus ability to dividend to the parent company  however  state insurance laws have provisions relating to the ability of the parent company to use cash generated by independence american 
for the twelve months ended december   our mgus paid  in dividends to corporate 
pursuant to the terms of a put call arrangement entered into at the time of acquisition  the company expects to acquire the remaining interest in marlton at the end of march cash flows as of december   the company had  of cash  cash equivalents  and investments net of amounts due to from brokers compared with  as of december  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was  net cash flows were the result of insurance revenues and fees from our mgus  partially offset by higher than expected claims and losses 
net cash used by investing activities of continuing operations for year ended december  was  this results from purchases of fixed maturities and equity securities net of sales of all such securities 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  resulting from the exercise of common stock options 
at december   the company had  of restricted cash at our mgus 
the amount at our mgus is directly offset by corresponding liabilities for premium and claim funds payable of  this asset  in part  represents the premium that is remitted by the insureds and is collected by our mgus on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent 
each month the premium is remitted to the insurance carriers by our mgus 
until such remittance is made the collected premium is carried as an asset on the balance sheet of each of our mgus with a corresponding payable to each insurance carrier 
in addition to the premium being held at our mgus  our mgus are in possession of cash to pay claims claim funds 
the cash is deposited by each insurance carrier into a bank account that our mgus can access 
the cash is used by our mgus to pay claims on behalf of the insurance carriers they represent 
the availability of cash enables our mgus to reimburse claims in a timely manner 
the company has  of insurance reserves that it expects to pay out of current assets and cash flows from future business 
if necessary  the company could sell its fixed maturity investments if the timing of claim payments associated with our insurance resources does not coincide with future cash flows 
the company believes it has sufficient cash to meet its currently anticipated business requirements over the next twelve months including the funding of discontinued operations  working capital requirements  and capital investments 
the company expects continued cash usage similar to the amount used in for its discontinued operations  which are primarily lease obligations  for the year ending december  asset quality the nature and quality of insurance company investments must comply with all applicable insurance statutes and regulations which have been promulgated primarily for the protection of policyholders 
of the aggregate carrying value of the company s cash and investments  approximately was invested in investment grade fixed income securities  securities purchased under resale agreements  and cash and cash equivalents at december  also at such date  of the company s fixed maturities were investment grade 
these investments carry less default risk and  therefore  lower interest rates than other types of fixed maturity investments 
at december   of the carrying value of fixed maturities was invested in non investment grade fixed income securities 
investments in such securities have different risks than investment grade securities  including greate r risk of loss upon default  and thinner trading markets 
the company does not have any non performing fixed maturities 
at december   the company had million invested in whole loan cmos backed by alt a mortgages  all of which were rated aaa 
of this amount  were in cmos that originated in or earlier and were in cmos that originated in the company s mortgage security portfolio has no exposure to sub prime mortgages 
the decline in market value for the equity securities was primarily due to wider spreads for preferred stocks issued by financial institutions following the disruption in credit markets in late the composition of the company s fixed maturities at december   utilizing standard and poor s rating categories  was as follows grade invested aaa aa a bbb bb investment impairments the company reviews its investments regularly and monitors its investments continually for impairments 
for the years ended december  and  the company had no realized losses for other than temporary impairments 
the company s gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities totaled  and  at december  and respectively 
substantially all of these securities were investment grade 
the unrealized losses have been evaluated in accordance with the company s policy and were determined to be temporary in nature at december  the company holds all fixed maturities as available for sale and accordingly marks all of its securities to market through accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
balance sheet total investments increased  to  at december  from  at december   due to income from continuing operations before income tax and the timing of insurance liabilities 
the  increase in total stockholders equity is primarily due to net income of  generated during  and the exercise of stock options 
the company had receivables from reinsurers of  at december  substantially all of the business ceded to such reinsurers is of short duration 
all of such receivables are either due from related parties  highly rated companies or are adequately secured 
no allowance for doubtful accounts was deemed necessary at december  capital resources due to its strong capital ratio and excellent asset quality and credit worthiness  the company remains well positioned to increase or diversify its current activities 
it is anticipated that future acquisitions or other expansion of operations will be funded internally from existing capital and surplus and parent company liquidity 
in the event additional funds are required  it is expected that they would be borrowed or raised in the public or private capital markets to the extent determined to be necessary or desirable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company may carry its portfolio of fixed income securities either as held to maturity carried at amortized cost  as trading securities carried at fair value or as available for sale carried at fair value 
the company has chosen to carry its fixed maturity securities as available for sale 
the company experienced a change in net unrealized loss of  reflecting a net unrealized loss of  at december  from a net unrealized loss of  at december  from time to time  as warranted  the company employs investment strategies to mitigate interest rate and other market exposures 
outlook independence american independence american  which is domiciled in delaware  is licensed to write property and or casualty insurance in states and the district of columbia  and has an a excellent rating from am best company  inc am best 
an am best rating is assigned after an extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of a company s financial condition and operating performance  and is also based upon factors relevant to policyholders  agents  and intermediaries  and is not directed towards protection of investors 
am best ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities of the company 
since its acquisition by amic in  independence american s primary source of revenue has been reinsurance premiums 
the majority of these premiums are ceded to independence american from pro rata quota share loss reinsurance treaties the ihc treaties with standard security life and madison national life  which are wholly owned subsidiaries of independence holding company ihc 
ihc currently owns of the company s common stock 
the ihc treaties were entered into in and terminate on december   unless terminated sooner by independence american 
there are three factors that determine the amount of premiums assumed by independence american i the percentage of business ceded to independence american pursuant to the ihc treaties or otherwise  ii the amount of gross premium produced by the mgus and other distribution sources written by standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to independence american under the ihc treaties  and iii the amount of gross premium produced by the mgus and other distribution sources written by carriers other than standard security life or madison national life that is ceded to independence american 
with respect to the ihc treaties  independence american assumes medical stop loss  fully insured health and short term statutory disability benefit dbl premiums from ihc

given its enhanced a excellent rating from am best  independence american expects to expand the distribution of its medical stop loss products through our mgus  and increase meaningfully the business written on its paper  especially major medical plans for individuals and families 
ihc treaties with respect to the ihc treaties  the company s operating results are affected by the following factors i the percentage of business ceded to independence american pursuant to the ihc treaties  ii the amount of gross premium written by standard security life and madison national life that can be ceded pursuant to the ihc treaties  and iii the profitability of the business ceded 
percentage of business ceded in and beyond  the percentage of medical stop loss ceded to independence american will depend on how much ihc determines it has available to reinsure and independence american s desire to reinsure ihc s business 
since the percentage being ceded is now well in excess of the contractual minimum  there is no guaranty that ihc will continue to increase the percentage of business ceded to independence american or  in fact  cede in excess of 
however  our mgus are the largest producers of medical stop loss business for ihc  controlling a majority of this premium in commencing in july  independence american began reinsuring of standard security life s short term statutory disability benefit product dbl 
standard security life is not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty year 
in  standard security life and madison national life began ceding of the majority of its fully insured health business to independence american 
standard security life and madison national life are not contractually obligated to continue to cede this business to independence american after termination of the current treaty years 
the company does not expect the percentage ceded to it from ihc will change significantly in the next twelve months upon renewal of each of the programs underlying the ihc treaties  standard security life and madison national life determine the maximum percentage of risk to be offered to independence american and independence american determines the percentage that it wishes to accept 
a typical pro rata quota share reinsurance treaty is for a twelve month period in which the ceding company and the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and expenses in an agreed proportion for all policies written with an effective date within this period 
most treaties run from january to december  but others could begin and end in other periods 
therefore the percentage ceded could change as the year progresses 
if independence american  standard security life  and madison national life had agreed to increase the average percentage ceded to independence american by from the ceded for the twelve months ended december  and standard security life s and madison national life s gross written premium had remained unchanged  independence american s premium would have increased by approximately million  which is approximately of total net premiums earned for the year ended december  that increase in premium  however  would not have flowed directly to pre tax operating income because of corresponding changes in insurance benefits  claims and reserves and other expenses attributable to the increase in premiums 
amount of gross premiums written the gross medical stop loss premiums written by ihc decreased in by and such premiums produced by our mgus decreased by in as a result of writing and or renewing fewer policies due to competitors willingness to write business at profit margins lower than those acceptable to the company  partially offset by increased rates on the policies retained 
this resulted in a decrease in the gross amount of premium available to be ceded to independence american 
our mgus do not anticipate materially increasing their production of medical stop loss business in ihc has reported that it expects its gross dbl premiums to decrease slightly in profitability the medical stop loss market is generally cyclical in nature 
when a product experiences several consecutive years of underwriting profitability  it is not unusual for there to be more competitors entering that line which can increase pressure on pricing and create a softer market 
the medical stop loss market began to soften in and less favorable conditions continued through as a result of these market conditions  the rate that the carriers that cede business to the company were able to charge for medical stop loss increased at a lesser rate in recent years  however  increases in medical trend have also been held in check to a greater extent and deductibles and attachment points have increased 
this reduces the risk taker s overall risk exposure 
fully insured health business tends to be less volatile and less cyclical than excess insurance 
therefore  the impact on the company s operating results relating to the ihc treaties can be summarized as follows i assuming the underlying business is profitable  the company s results would be positively impacted if ihc were to cede a higher percentage and adversely affected if ihc were to cede less  ii independence american s income would be negatively impacted if ihc s gross premium written were to decrease  and iii independence american s income in future years would be positively affected if ihc were to produce higher profit margins  and negatively impacted if loss ratios increase
