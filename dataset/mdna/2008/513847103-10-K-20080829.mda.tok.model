we then provide a review of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements 
executive summary business overview lancaster colony corporation is primarily a manufacturer and marketer of consumer goods 
our focus is manufacturing and marketing specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets 
we also manufacture and market candles for the food  drug and mass markets 
less significantly  we have operations engaged in the distribution of various products  including glassware and candles  to commercial markets 
our operating businesses are organized in two reportable segments specialty foods and glassware and candles 
over of the sales of each segment are made to customers in the united states 
in recent years  our strategy has shifted away from operating businesses in a variety of industries towards emphasizing the growth and success we have achieved in our specialty foods segment 
fiscal marked another significant year in implementing this strategy as we continued to divest nonfood operations and focus our capital investment in the specialty foods segment 
in june  we sold substantially all of the assets of our remaining automotive operations 
in november  we sold most of our consumer and floral glass operating assets 
these transactions  combined with other strategic dispositions and investments in and  have resulted in transforming our company into a food focused business 
in  approximately of our consolidated net sales and effectively all of our operating income were derived from the specialty foods segment 
for perspective  in  our specialty foods segment comprised approximately and of our reported consolidated net sales and operating income  respectively 
below is a list of the material transactions and other events that have contributed toward our transition to a food focused business over the past two fiscal years june sale of the remaining automotive operations  ending the previously reported automotive segment  november sale of substantially all of the operating assets of our consumer and floral glass operations  september substantial completion and operational start up of new frozen yeast roll facility in horse cave  kentucky 
this facility adjoins the dressing facility noted below and allows us to take advantage of various synergies  june sale of our automotive accessory operations based in coshocton  ohio and lagrange  georgia  
table of contents june acquisition of marshall biscuit company  inc marshall biscuit  march sale of automotive accessory operations in wapakoneta  ohio  march initiated closure of our industrial glass operations located in lancaster  ohio  and fall operational start up of new dressing facility in horse cave  kentucky 
although we have made substantial progress in implementing our new strategy  we continue to own the candle operations referred to above 
due to existing market conditions  we do not expect further progress on our strategic evaluation of these operations 
however  we will continue to review our options and may revisit our efforts as conditions improve 
our only other remaining nonfood operation is primarily engaged in distributing glassware  candles and other products to commercial markets 
this operation is not material to our consolidated operations  and we continue to review various strategic alternatives with respect to this operation 
our current strategy focuses our efforts on the most profitable part of our business and minimizes the amount of financial and management resources devoted to sectors that have trended toward lower growth potential and operating margins 
while our recent results have been adversely affected by high commodity and petroleum costs  we have taken several steps that we expect may provide significant benefits over time  including in fiscal with less distraction from significant issues previously presented by the automotive and glassware businesses  we believe we are well suited to maximize the future potential of our specialty foods segment 
we view our food operations as having the potential to achieve future growth in sales and profitability due to attributes such as leading retail market positions in several branded products with a high quality perception  a broad customer base in both retail and foodservice accounts  well regarded culinary expertise among foodservice accounts  recognized leadership in foodservice product development  demonstrated experience in integrating complementary business acquisitions  and historically strong cash flow generation that supports growth opportunities 
our goal is to continue to grow our specialty foods retail and foodservice business by leveraging the strength of our retail brands to increase current product sales and introduce new products  continuing to grow our foodservice sales through the strength of our reputation in product development and quality  and pursuing acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria 
within retail markets  our specialty foods group utilizes numerous branded products to support growth and maintain market competitiveness 
we place great emphasis on our product innovation and development efforts so as to enhance growth by providing distinctive new products meeting the evolving needs and preferences of consumers 
our foodservice sales primarily consist of products sold to restaurant chains 
we have experienced broad based growth in our foodservice sales  as we build on our strong reputation for product development and quality 
we expect that part of our growth in the specialty foods segment will result from acquisitions 
we continue to review potential acquisitions that we believe will provide good complements to our existing product lines  enhance our gross margins or offer good expansion opportunities in a manner that fits our overall goals 
consistent with our current acquisition strategy  in june  we acquired the principal assets of marshall biscuit  a privately owned producer and marketer of frozen yeast rolls and biscuits based in saraland  alabama 
the purchase price was approximately million  and the transaction is discussed in further detail in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as noted above  we recently made substantial capital investments to support our existing food operations and future growth opportunities 
in  we began production activities at a newly constructed dressing facility located in kentucky 
our investment in constructing this facility exceeded million 
during  we also commenced and largely completed construction of an adjacent facility for the manufacture of frozen yeast rolls 
this facility required a slightly smaller total investment and began operation in early both projects will help accommodate potential future sales growth and also provide greater manufacturing efficiencies 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
summary of results the following is an overview of our consolidated operating results for the year ended june  the current and prior year results reflect the classification of the sold automotive operations as discontinued operations 
consolidated net sales reached approximately million during  increasing as compared to prior year sales of approximately million  driven by growth coming from our specialty foods segment as partially offset by a decline in sales of the glassware and candles segment 
the specialty foods segment s growth reflected higher volumes of both retail and foodservice products  as well as price increases 
the decrease in sales of the glassware and candles segment is primarily attributable to the sale of our consumer and floral glass operations in november gross margin declined to approximately million from the prior year comparable total of million 
our manufacturing costs have been influenced by higher raw material costs  especially for various key food commodities and paraffin wax 
within our specialty foods segment  price increases we began implementing in helped offset some of the higher ingredient costs  but the price increases have lagged the substantial increase in ingredient costs we have experienced 
overall results were also affected by the funds received under cdsoa 
in  we received approximately million under cdsoa  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in for a more detailed discussion of cdsoa  see the subcaption other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act of this md a 
income from continuing operations for the current year was approximately million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
net of an after tax loss from discontinued operations in of approximately million  or 
per diluted share  net income totaled million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in  which was net of an after tax loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
the current year loss on sale from discontinued operations was approximately million  or 
per diluted share  including the after tax loss on the sale of our des moines  iowa automotive accessory operations of approximately million  as discussed below  and current year adjustments of approximately million to the loss recorded on our june sale of an automotive accessories division 
the prior year loss on sale from discontinued operations of approximately million  or 
per diluted share  was attributable to the after tax loss on two automotive divestitures 
net income in totaled approximately million  or per diluted share  and was inclusive of after tax income from discontinued operations of approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
business divestitures in june  as part of a strategic alternative review of nonfood operations  we sold effectively all of the operating assets of our remaining automotive accessory operations 
the cash transaction resulted in a pretax loss of approximately million for the year ended june  these operations represented the last remaining portion of our automotive segment 
see further discussion of this divestiture in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we have reclassified the results of these divested operations into the discontinued operations  net of tax section of the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in november  we sold substantially all of our consumer and floral glass operating assets 
the cash transaction resulted in a pretax loss of approximately million  which is recorded in cost of sales 
these 
table of contents operations were included in our glassware and candles segment 
the financial results of these operations do not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations under guidance provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas and  therefore  have been included in continuing operations for all periods presented 
see further discussion of this divestiture in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
looking forward based on current conditions  we expect to attain growth in consolidated sales during  primarily by introducing new products  expanding market presence and benefiting from and price increases among several of our product lines 
we will continue to review acquisition opportunities within the specialty foods segment that are consistent with our growth strategy  represent good value or otherwise provide significant strategic benefits 
as was the case in  we expect that our business will continue to face the challenge of adjusting to significantly higher levels of raw material costs  particularly for certain food ingredients and paraffin wax 
within our specialty foods segment  we have implemented a number of price increases in and early to offset these increased costs 
as progresses  we anticipate that this segment s margins may improve due to the extent of these higher prices 
we also note  however  that the overall effect of industry wide price increases is not yet clear 
as commodity prices have remained consistently high  price increases passed to the consumer have become a significant trend in both the retail and foodservice markets 
what effect  if any  these price increases may have on consumer demand at retail grocers or restaurants to which we sell product is not known at this time 
we have also pursued other operational strategies designed to help offset or stabilize the impact of rising commodity costs that we believe will aid our results 
for instance  as part of our cost reduction efforts  in early we began consolidating our atlanta production operations into our other existing facilities 
with respect to our glassware and candles segment  we expect to gain benefit from recent pricing actions and new products 
however  we also anticipate that uncertain market conditions  higher wax costs  the effect of lower production levels and the absence of contribution from divested glass operations will challenge comparative segment margins for at least the first half of for a more detailed discussion of the effect of commodity costs  see the impact of inflation section of this md a below 
in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
we will continue to reassess our allocation of capital periodically  as well as the timing  nature and extent of our share repurchase activities  to ensure that we maintain adequate operating flexibility while providing appropriate levels of cash returns to shareholders 
review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles 
table of contents net sales and gross margin year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales specialty foods glassware and candles total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased to approximately million from the prior year total of approximately million 
the sales growth was driven by increased sales in the specialty foods segment as partially offset by a decline in sales of the glassware and candles segment 
while somewhat lower candle sales occurred  most of the latter decline was attributable to the divestiture of our consumer and floral glass operations 
increased pricing and sales volume significantly contributed to the higher sales of our specialty foods segment 
our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately in compared with in and in to a much greater extent than that experienced in  we encountered higher raw material costs in  especially for key food commodities and paraffin wax 
increased food pricing generally lagged the timing of cost increases and did not fully recover their impact 
also affecting results were a charge of approximately million recorded in cost of sales for the loss on the sale of our consumer and floral glass operations  a pension settlement charge of approximately million recorded in corporate expenses and income of approximately million to reflect a favorable adjustment of prior year self insured deductibles under general liability insurance 
fiscal margins also encompassed higher raw material costs including key food commodities and paraffin wax 
other factors influencing included start up costs associated with a new food manufacturing facility as well as approximately million of inventory write downs associated with the closure of our industrial glass operation

we wrote off approximately million related to this bankruptcy in selling  general and administrative expenses were relatively stable as a percentage of sales for the years ended june   and restructuring and impairment charge in  we announced our plan to close our industrial glass operation located in lancaster  ohio 
during  we recorded a restructuring and impairment charge of approximately million million after taxes  including million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories 
active business operations have ceased for this operation 
the operations of this closed unit have not been reclassified to discontinued operations under the guidance provided in sfas during  we recorded additional charges of approximately million million after taxes  including less than million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories  for costs incurred 
table of contents during the period 
the majority of these charges consisted of costs associated with real property disposal related activities 
the total costs associated with this plant closure are expected to be approximately million and include the above noted costs and other costs associated with future real property disposal related activities 
total remaining cash expenditures are estimated to be approximately million and are expected to occur over the balance of calendar during  a portion of the unsold real property that was related to the closing noted above  as well as the real property we retained in connection with our june sale of our automotive accessory division and our november sale of consumer and floral glass operations  met the criteria defined in sfas to be considered held for sale 
as such  these assets  with a net book value of approximately million  have been reclassified to current assets and are included in deferred income taxes and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in accordance with sfas  we will no longer be depreciating these held for sale assets

see further discussion of operating results by segment following the discussion of net income below 
interest expense higher levels of indebtedness resulted in interest expense of approximately million in as compared to less than million in there was no interest expense recorded in 
table of contents other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act the cdsoa provides for the distribution of monies collected by us customs from antidumping cases to qualifying domestic producers 
our reported cdsoa receipts totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
these remittances related to certain candles being imported from the people s republic of china 
the cdsoa has faced a growing number of legal challenges 
in february  legislation was enacted to repeal the applicability of the cdsoa to duties collected on imported products after september this legislation is expected to reduce any distributions in years after  with distributions eventually ceasing 
in addition  the cit ruled in two separate cases that the procedure for determining recipients eligible to receive cdsoa distributions is unconstitutional 
the cit rulings are still under appeal  and other cases have been brought  from time to time  challenging various aspects of the cdsoa 
the ultimate resolution of ongoing litigation concerning the cdsoa and the effects  if any  the litigation will have on our financial results or receipt of future cdsoa distributions  are uncertain 
based on the current legal challenges  it is possible that we may not receive any cdsoa distributions in and beyond 
interest income and other net interest income and other for totaled approximately million as compared to million in and million in the decrease from to was primarily due to lower interest income  despite higher interest rates  as our aggregate level of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased significantly as compared to due to the extent of share repurchases  dividend payments and capital expenditures 
income from continuing operations before income taxes as affected by the factors discussed above  our income from continuing operations before income taxes for of approximately million decreased from the total of million 
the total income from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately million 
our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was  and in  and  respectively 
the rate was influenced by a higher federal deduction related to domestic production activities 
the rate was influenced by lower levels of tax free income as compared to the rate benefited from changes in state tax laws within ohio  an increased deduction for dividends paid to the esop plan due to the per share special dividend paid in december  and the new federal deduction created by the american jobs creation act related to domestic manufacturing activities 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations totaled approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  as influenced by the level of cdsoa receipts 
income from continuing operations per share totaled approximately per basic and diluted share in  as compared to and per basic and diluted share  respectively  in and and per basic and diluted share  respectively  in income per share in each of the last three years has been beneficially affected by share repurchases  which have totaled approximately million over the three year period ended june  discontinued operations in  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  net of tax  including an after tax loss of approximately million on the sale of our des moines  iowa automotive accessory operations and current year adjustments of approximately million related to the loss recorded on our june sale of an automotive accessories division 
loss from discontinued operations per share totaled approximately 
per basic and diluted share in in  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  net of tax  including an after tax loss of approximately million on the sales of our automotive accessory operations located in wapakoneta  ohio  coshocton  ohio  and lagrange  georgia 
loss from discontinued operations per share totaled approximately 
per basic and diluted share in in  we recorded income from discontinued operations  net of tax  of approximately million  or 
per basic and diluted share 

table of contents net income net income for of approximately million decreased from net income of approximately million 
net income was approximately million in diluted net income per share totaled approximately in  a decrease from the prior year total of 
the latter amount was lower than diluted earnings per share of 
segment review specialty foods net sales of the specialty foods segment during surpassed the record level achieved in  although operating income of approximately million decreased from the level of million 
the benefits from the higher sales volumes were more than offset by substantially higher ingredient costs 
net sales during totaled approximately million  an increase over the prior year total of million 
sales for increased over the total of approximately million 
the percentage of retail customer sales within the segment was approximately during compared to in and in in  net sales of the specialty foods segment benefited from improved pricing and greater sales volumes of both retail and foodservice products 
the retail increases occurred among numerous product lines  including frozen rolls  produce dressings and dips  and croutons 
retail sales in the current year also benefited from the incremental sales totaling approximately million from marshall biscuit  which was acquired in june also influencing the relative comparability of was the adverse effect on prior year sales resulting from consumer food safety concerns regarding fresh produce  which indirectly affected sales of related products such as our retail produce dressings and vegetable dips 
the foodservice increases in occurred generally through broad foodservice growth and improved pricing 
entering  consistent with the actions of many others in the industry  further price increases are anticipated across many of our product lines 
the increased sales of the specialty foods segment during primarily reflected higher foodservice volumes 
retail channel increases occurred primarily within certain frozen product lines  particularly yeast rolls 
the demand for retail salad dressings and related products was constrained in by consumer demand for bagged salads and lettuce being adversely affected by lingering consumer concerns over food safety issues and pathogen contamination occurring in the first half of the fiscal year 
net pricing relief gained in to help offset higher material costs was not significant 
sales recorded from the marshall biscuit operations acquired in june were immaterial to results 
the foodservice increases in occurred broadly across many product lines and customers 
operating income of the specialty foods segment in totaled approximately million  a decrease from the total of million 
the level was lower than the level of million 
substantially and broadly higher food commodity costs were a significant factor in the comparative decline 
many key commodities  such as soybean oil and flour  reached record highs 
we estimate that the extent of such increased costs exceeded the levels by more than million  and only about half of these increases could be recovered through higher pricing 
many of these costs remain well above the prior year levels as we enter of much lesser impact were higher energy costs  increased segment depreciation and amortization  and start up costs in the first half of associated with the opening of a new frozen roll facility 
despite the higher sales volumes achieved in as compared to  operating income was adversely affected by higher ingredient costs  such as for soybean oil  dairy derived products  eggs and flour  and costs associated with plant start up and customer rollouts at the new salad dressing manufacturing facility located in kentucky 
we also experienced competitive market conditions for certain garlic bread items 
segment review glassware and candles net sales of the glassware and candles segment are comprised primarily of sales of candles and related accessories 
segment sales during totaled approximately million  a decrease from net sales of million 
the decline in net sales of the glassware and candles segment for was influenced by the sale of our consumer and floral glass operations in november  as well as the earlier closure of our industrial glassware facility 
net sales attributable to these divested and closed operations 
table of contents totaled approximately million in compared to approximately million in both and candle sales in were adversely affected by softer sales during the holiday season  as influenced by certain seasonal programs that were not repeated in and generally lackluster retail market conditions 
compared to net sales in totaling approximately million  sales increased less than 
this increase was attributable to stronger candle volumes among various accounts 
sales of glassware declined slightly  as influenced by lower sales of industrial glassware 
the segment recorded an operating loss of approximately million during  decreasing from the prior year operating income of million 
operating income for totaled approximately million 
comparisons to were affected by the approximately million loss recorded in cost of sales from the november sale of our consumer and floral glass operations  as well as the loss of subsequent contribution from these operations over the balance of margins for were also adversely affected by rising paraffin wax input costs and lower candle production levels 
the results reflected improved operating performance  the benefits of new product introductions and modest gains from price increases 
the results also reflected a restructuring charge of approximately million  including million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories  related to the closure of our industrial glass manufacturing facility located in lancaster  ohio 
operating results in were adversely affected by over million in unabsorbed pretax costs relating to an extended idling of our oklahoma glassware facility and higher natural gas costs in the first half of these negatives were offset somewhat by benefits from better production efficiencies at our oklahoma facility prior to the idling 
our results will exclude the benefit of operating contribution of glass operations  which were sold or closed during based on current conditions  higher paraffin wax costs and low operating levels are likely to persist 
we intend to aggressively implement necessary pricing actions during to help counter these escalated costs 
future results may also be sensitive to capacity utilization rates due to the relatively high level of fixed manufacturing costs that exist in this segment 
liquidity and capital resources in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
our balance sheet retained fundamental financial strength during  and we ended the year with net debt defined as debt of million less cash and equivalents of approximately million at june  of less than million and shareholders equity in excess of million 
replacing a similar  but smaller  facility  we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility with several commercial banks in october under the new facility  we may borrow up to a maximum of million at any one time  with the potential to expand the total credit availability to million based on obtaining consent of the issuing bank and certain other conditions 
we currently have million outstanding under this facility 
the facility expires on october   and all outstanding amounts are due and payable on that day 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  asset sales and acquisitions  and financial covenants relating to interest coverage and leverage 
terms of the related agreement allow for borrowings to occur at or below the us prime rate of interest 
loans may be used for general corporate purposes 
we believe that internally generated funds  the existing credit facility and an ability to obtain additional financing  combined with the current cash and equivalents on hand  will be sufficient to meet operating requirements and fund future foreseeable capital needs 

table of contents cash flows from continuing operations year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
provided by operating activities provided by used in investing activities used in financing activities our cash flows for the years through are presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the current and prior year balance sheets and statements of cash flows reflect the classification of the sold automotive operations as discontinued operations 
cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in totaled approximately million  a decrease of as compared with the prior year total of million  which decreased from the total of million 
the decrease was influenced by lower income from continuing operations and the extent of comparatively unfavorable relative changes in working capital components 
the decrease results primarily from our reduced level of income from continuing operations and comparatively unfavorable relative changes in working capital components  especially inventory 
net cash from investing activities totaled a source of approximately million  and uses of approximately million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase in cash from investing activities reflects the net proceeds from the sale of our consumer and floral glass operations of approximately million and a substantially lower level of capital expenditures in as compared to the increase in cash used for investing activities reflects million paid for the acquisition of marshall biscuit in june capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  compared to million in and million in capital expenditures were higher in and as compared to historical levels due to the construction of a new salad dressing facility during these years as well as a new frozen yeast roll facility in production at the new frozen yeast roll facility began in early capital spending allocations during by segment approximated for specialty foods and for glassware and candles 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
financing activities used net cash totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used for financing activities is due primarily to increased treasury share repurchases as well as relative changes in net borrowing activities 
the decrease in is primarily due to decreased dividend payments  proceeds from short term borrowings and lower share repurchases offset somewhat by the comparative change in cash overdraft balances 
dividend payments in included a special cash dividend of per common share in the second quarter 
the total payment for cash dividends for the year ended june  was approximately million 
the dividend payout rate for was per share as compared to per share during  and per share  excluding the special dividend  in this past fiscal year marked the th consecutive year in which our dividend rate was increased 
cash utilized for share repurchases totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our board approved a share repurchase authorization of  shares in august approximately  shares from this authorization remained authorized for future purchase at june  on february   pursuant to our previously announced share repurchase program  we purchased  shares of common stock from the estate of dorothy b 
fox the estate at a price per share of  which was equal to the average closing price of our common stock over the eight trading days beginning february  robert l 
fox  one of our directors  served as executor of the estate 
the future levels of share repurchases and declared dividends are subject to the periodic review of our board and are generally determined after an assessment is made of such factors as anticipated earnings levels  cash flow requirements and general business conditions 

table of contents our ongoing business activities continue to be subject to compliance with various laws  rules and regulations as may be issued and enforced by various federal  state and local agencies 
with respect to environmental matters  costs are incurred pertaining to regulatory compliance and  upon occasion  remediation 
such costs have not been  and are not anticipated to become  material

we have various contractual obligations that are appropriately recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
certain other items  such as purchase obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of items not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements are commitments to purchase raw materials or inventory that has not yet been received as of june  and future minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements

purchase obligations represent purchase orders and longer term purchase arrangements related to the procurement of supplies  raw materials  and property  plant and equipment 
these obligations include a purchase commitment arising out of the sale of our consumer and floral glass operating assets for which we are not obligated  but would be subject to a penalty if the commitment were not met

these items are excluded  as it is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
impact of inflation our manufacturing costs during and were influenced by substantially higher raw material costs  especially for various key food commodities and paraffin wax 
the year over year increase in raw material costs for the specialty foods segment is estimated to have exceeded million 
it appears that the 
table of contents trend toward markedly higher food commodity costs  such as soybean oil  dairy derived products  eggs and flour may be sustainable due to fundamental changes in worldwide food supply and demand 
historically  our diversity of operations has helped minimize our exposure to some raw material costs 
as we focus more on our food operations  however  our results of operations have become more sensitive to increased prices in food commodities 
over the course of  we adjusted various selling prices of food products to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments generally lagged the increase in our costs  having a net negative impact on our operating margins 
we expect that we will take further pricing actions on both food and candle products in  although our ability to sufficiently or successfully increase such prices could result in a further decline in our gross margins 
we also attempt to minimize the exposure to increased costs through our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have typically not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize net sales and related cost of sales at the time of shipment of the products  or at the time when all substantial risks of ownership change  if later 
net sales are recorded net of estimated sales discounts  returns and certain sales incentives  including coupons and rebates 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products and may differ from actual due to such factors as changes in customer and consumer demand 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 

table of contents long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether or not indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized 
it is evaluated annually  at april  through asset impairment assessments as appropriate 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means are amortized over their useful lives 
we periodically evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns 
this evaluation is based on consideration of expected future undiscounted cash flows and other operating factors 
carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 
accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
in  improvements in claims experience led to a favorable pretax adjustment of prior years reserves of approximately million 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index  yield curve analysis results from our actuaries based on expected cash flows of our plans  and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
we  along with our third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
upon adoption in of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas  we recognized the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize changes in that funded status  caused by subsequent plan revaluations  through comprehensive income
